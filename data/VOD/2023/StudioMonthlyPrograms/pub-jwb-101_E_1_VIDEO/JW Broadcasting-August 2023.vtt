00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:05.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so happy to have you join us again

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
here on JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the next hour,
we’ll talk about how to become

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
a better teacher of God’s Word.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll also join Dilan and Isaac

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some candid talk

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the peer pressure
they faced in high school.

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see an interview with Maria Kaloyanoff,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
who smuggled hundreds of pieces
of Bible literature

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
into Communist Europe
during the 1960’s.

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
What motivated this young mother

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
to risk imprisonment again and again?

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll enjoy a beautiful new music video

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
that highlights how much Jehovah appreciates

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:49.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
the quality of our sacrifices,

00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we’re limited in what we can do.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the August 2023 edition

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
How important is the use of illustrations?

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.938 line:10% position:50% align:center
Are they simply fluff in our teaching?

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:26.440 line:10% position:50% align:center
One definition of the English word “fluff”

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.192 line:10% position:50% align:center
is this:

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“something essentially trivial

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lacking importance or solid worth.”

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:38.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are illustrations trivial
and of little worth?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along on-screen

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I read our theme scripture,

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 13:34:

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:53.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by illustrations.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:55.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, without an illustration

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:57.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would not speak to them.”

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:02.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
We often call Jesus the Great Teacher.

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Illustrations were essential

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:07.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fully grasp what was being taught.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:09.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we won’t be spending a lot of time

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the dos and don’ts of using illustrations.

00:02:13.862 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight on the Scriptures</i>
has a whole topic on “Illustrations.”

00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Apply Yourself </i>
<i>to Reading and Teaching</i>  brochure

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
has some helpful suggestions in lesson 8.

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:29.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me remind you, also,

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a talk that Brother Splane
of the Governing Body gave

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the 2020 regional convention.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title was “Improve Your Skills
—Illustrating Key Points.”

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had some very practical suggestions,
which I won’t be repeating here,

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
so perhaps you’ll want
to review Brother Splane’s talk

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an upcoming family worship.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, the Bible
actually identifies Jesus’ expression

00:02:57.573 --> 00:03:00.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an illustration;

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:02.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of the time,
it does not.

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just part of the way
he spoke naturally;

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
illustrations flowed from him.

00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did he come up with them
so readily?

00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:17.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was observant
of what was happening around him.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
We too can be observant.

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:24.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help to train us
to think in illustrations.

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:28.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
The bread and the wine used
at the Memorial of Christ’s death

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:32.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
beautifully represented
Jesus’ perfect body and blood

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be given
in behalf of sinful mankind.

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:40.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can learn something
about our use of illustrations

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:44.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
by considering the circumstances
of the Lord’s Evening Meal.

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:46.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it:

00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:48.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
From years of attending,

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew what was going to be
on the Passover table that night.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:56.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he could’ve thought in advance

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:59.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
of using those emblems in that way.

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:01.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know for sure.

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:07.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a simple, logical,
and indelible impression it made that night

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:10.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continues to make on millions of us

00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:12.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 2,000 years later!

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re going to give
a talk or demonstration

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:20.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
at one of our meetings,
we already know the topic.

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have the luxury of thinking
of an illustration in advance.

00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:28.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if we’re teaching a Bible student

00:04:28.872 --> 00:04:32.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he asks us an unexpected question?

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:36.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment,
you’ll likely mentally consider your student

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what you know about his work, his hobbies,

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:42.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just his daily life experiences—

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an illustration may come to your mind
on the spur of the moment.

00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:53.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s see how that latter process
(an unexpected situation)

00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:55.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
was faced by Jesus.

00:04:55.983 --> 00:04:59.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this case,
we can understand his thought process

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:03.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
in coming up with masterful illustrations.

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:09.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
John chapter 4 is the account
about the Samaritan woman at the well.

00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:14.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 4:34,
Jesus used the illustration of food.

00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:15.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said there:

00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:20.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My food is to do the will of him who sent me

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:22.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to finish his work.”

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a simple, effective illustration.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why might he have used
the generic expression “food”

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:33.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of something more specific

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
like “my wine” or “my bread
is to do the will of him who sent me”?

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:41.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at the context.

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:45.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, in quick succession,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used two different illustrations.

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:51.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in both cases,
it seems from the context

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:55.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he came up with these
based on what was happening at the time.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 4:7 says:

00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:03.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:07.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said to her: ‘Give me a drink.’”

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:11.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s setup number one
for an illustration about water.

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:14.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says:

00:06:14.603 --> 00:06:16.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For his disciples had gone off

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:19.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the city to buy food.”

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:24.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s setup number two
for an illustration about food.

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:28.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus didn’t orchestrate all of this
in advance.

00:06:28.784 --> 00:06:30.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just circumstantial

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:34.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus asked a woman
who approached with a water jar

00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:36.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give him a drink.

00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:40.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus instantly thought of and used

00:06:40.337 --> 00:06:43.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
the subject of water as an illustration.

00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:46.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 10 says:

00:06:46.885 --> 00:06:50.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you had known of the free gift of God

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:52.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and who it is who says to you,

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:54.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Give me a drink,’

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you would have asked him,

00:06:56.353 --> 00:06:59.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would have given you living water.”

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:03.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
The illustration was spontaneous.

00:07:03.527 --> 00:07:07.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
It effectively led
to a fine witness about Jesus.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:13.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in illustration number two,
look in verse 27.

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:18.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is still talking to the woman
when the disciples return from the city.

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:21.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember that verse 8 said

00:07:21.253 --> 00:07:25.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
the disciples had gone
“into the city to buy food”?

00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:29.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they come back,
and they have some food for Jesus.

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:34.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Going to verse 28, the woman leaves.

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:36.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what the disciples now say to Jesus,

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:40.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is a setup for illustration number two

00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:45.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not water, but food now becomes
the topic of conversation.

00:07:46.278 --> 00:07:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 31:

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him:

00:07:51.325 --> 00:07:53.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Rabbi, eat.’”

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:58.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “eat” caused Jesus
to think of the now famous illustration

00:07:58.081 --> 00:08:00.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we quote regularly.

00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:02.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 32:

00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:04.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he said to them:

00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:06.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have food to eat

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you do not know about.’”

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:11.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the disciples are puzzled.

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:12.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 33:

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:15.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the disciples said to one another:

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:19.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No one brought him anything to eat, did he?’

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:23.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus [picking up on the topic at hand]
said to them:

00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:27.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My food
is to do the will of him who sent me

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to finish his work.’”

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now obviously,
Jesus did not choreograph

00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:34.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
all this in advance.

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:37.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
But based on the circumstances at hand,

00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:40.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
he came up with illustrations that worked.

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:43.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in what way?

00:08:43.794 --> 00:08:48.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the point of similarity
between God’s will and food?

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:51.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eating good food is enjoyable.

00:08:51.468 --> 00:08:53.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s satisfying!

00:08:53.178 --> 00:08:54.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point?

00:08:54.554 --> 00:08:57.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus enjoyed doing God’s will.

00:08:57.432 --> 00:09:01.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was satisfying to him
—like eating a tasty meal.

00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:07.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another point of similarity
is that food invigorates a person.

00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:09.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was invigorated

00:09:09.694 --> 00:09:12.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
by that conversation
with the Samaritan woman.

00:09:13.657 --> 00:09:17.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now glance back up in verses 3-6.

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:20.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says that Jesus had “left Judea” on foot.

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:22.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look in verse 6:

00:09:22.874 --> 00:09:24.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Jesus,

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:27.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“tired out as he was from the journey,

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:29.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was sitting at the well.

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:31.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about the sixth hour.”

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
after witnessing to the woman at the well,

00:09:35.762 --> 00:09:38.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is invigorated.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even alluded to the idea

00:09:40.183 --> 00:09:44.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the experience
was more energizing than literal food.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:49.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have we learned thus far
from the process?

00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:54.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you know beforehand
what will be discussed,

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:58.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gives you the opportunity
to think of an appropriate illustration

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
in advance.

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:03.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
If something comes up unexpectedly,

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:06.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
often you can use
what you’ve observed around you

00:10:06.793 --> 00:10:10.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what you already know
to generate an effective illustration.

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:16.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might be thinking:
‘Uh, I’m not really creative.

00:10:16.928 --> 00:10:20.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It takes a while
for me to think up an illustration,

00:10:20.474 --> 00:10:24.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘even when I know in advance
that I have an assignment at the meeting.

00:10:25.187 --> 00:10:27.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘On-the-spot illustrations?

00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:29.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s probably not going to happen for me

00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:33.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the way my brain works
or doesn’t work.’

00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:37.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a way to train the brain

00:10:37.407 --> 00:10:40.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think in illustration mode?

00:10:40.494 --> 00:10:41.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:47.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way is by observing creation

00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:49.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
or man-made inventions,

00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:51.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when you don’t have a talk to give

00:10:51.963 --> 00:10:54.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even when your children
are not with you.

00:10:55.383 --> 00:10:57.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what you observe,

00:10:57.385 --> 00:11:00.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reason out how it could be applied

00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:02.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a teaching lesson in the future.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Write it down if you need to
so as to remember it.

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:12.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
One father told me that even when
his children were not with him,

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:14.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would look at creation

00:11:14.027 --> 00:11:16.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come up with a line of reasoning

00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:19.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might be helpful in the future.

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:21.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave an example.

00:11:21.117 --> 00:11:24.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
He observed two kittens playing together.

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:26.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reasoned:

00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:29.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do those kittens look happy?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes.

00:11:30.752 --> 00:11:32.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If Jehovah knows what it takes

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make two kittens happy,

00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:37.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do you think he knows

00:11:37.133 --> 00:11:39.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
what it would take to make you happy?”

00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:42.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously, a child would agree.

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:47.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So if Jehovah knows what it would take
to make you happy,

00:11:47.477 --> 00:11:51.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
what should you do if Jehovah says
to do something a certain way?”

00:11:52.482 --> 00:11:54.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Profound, Dad!

00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:57.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do it Jehovah’s way
if you want to be happy.

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:02.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the beautiful reality,
the golden moment,

00:12:02.284 --> 00:12:04.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
was when he saw one of his sons

00:12:04.286 --> 00:12:07.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
watching two squirrels
in a tree chasing each other.

00:12:08.832 --> 00:12:11.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used the squirrels as his illustration,

00:12:11.668 --> 00:12:15.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the prepared line of reasoning.

00:12:15.505 --> 00:12:20.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now his son still remembers that point
many decades later.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ brain thought creatively
when using illustrations.

00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:32.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
For another example,
please turn with me to John 1:42.

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:37.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus changed Simon’s name on the spot.

00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:41.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 1:42:

00:12:41.031 --> 00:12:46.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he [Andrew] led him [Simon] to Jesus.

00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:49.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Jesus looked at him, he said:

00:12:49.247 --> 00:12:51.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You are Simon, the son of John;

00:12:51.916 --> 00:12:54.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will be called Cephas’

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:56.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which is translated ‘Peter’).”

00:12:57.672 --> 00:13:02.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why did Jesus change his name
to Cephas, or Peter?

00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:06.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
It actually seems to be creative thinking.

00:13:06.848 --> 00:13:11.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word for Peter is <i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tros,</i>
not <i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tra.</i>

00:13:11.978 --> 00:13:14.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tra</i>  means “Rock Mass,”

00:13:14.397 --> 00:13:17.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that applies to Jesus, the cornerstone,

00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:19.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
the head of the Christian congregation.

00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:23.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, <i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tros</i>  means “A Piece of Rock.”

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful description of Peter!

00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:31.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, Peter didn’t seem to be dependable.

00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:33.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus saw good qualities in him

00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:38.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave him the name Peter
(<i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tros,</i> Piece of Rock).

00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:41.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect,

00:13:41.424 --> 00:13:45.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was saying
that he would become as stable as a rock.

00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:48.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s precisely what transpired.

00:13:48.223 --> 00:13:50.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great word picture,

00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:52.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
or illustration, by Jesus!

00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:56.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 1:1,

00:13:56.147 --> 00:13:58.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
under inspiration to John,

00:13:58.149 --> 00:14:00.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said that that book of the Bible was

00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:05.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a revelation by Jesus Christ,
which God gave him.”

00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:08.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Insight</i>  book says:

00:14:08.618 --> 00:14:12.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The book of Revelation
concludes the Holy Scriptures

00:14:12.497 --> 00:14:15.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with one
of the most outstanding concentrations

00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:19.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
of illustrations found in the entire Bible.”

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:24.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
You recall our theme is from Matthew 13:34:

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:28.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Without an Illustration
He Would Not Speak to Them.”

00:14:29.472 --> 00:14:33.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
As another example,
Jesus gave his famous Sermon on the Mount.

00:14:33.935 --> 00:14:37.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Matthew chapter 7,
the last chapter of that sermon,

00:14:37.647 --> 00:14:41.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
he used at least ten different illustrations.

00:14:42.152 --> 00:14:46.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, “without an illustration
he would not speak to them.”

00:14:47.532 --> 00:14:51.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 7:28
sums up the Sermon on the Mount, saying:

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Jesus finished these sayings,

00:14:55.206 --> 00:14:58.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the effect was that the crowds were astounded

00:14:58.376 --> 00:15:00.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
at his way of teaching.”

00:15:01.004 --> 00:15:04.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:21 says that Jesus left

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a model for [us]
to follow his steps closely.”

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes his art of teaching,

00:15:11.306 --> 00:15:15.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
which incorporated
extensive use of illustrations.

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:18.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were pithy and to the point.

00:15:18.605 --> 00:15:21.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
May each of us train ourselves
to think that way

00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:24.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strive to improve our teaching skills

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:27.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of illustrations.

00:15:29.657 --> 00:15:32.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was able to reach hearts

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:35.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only by means
of his teaching skills

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also because of his
outstanding qualities.

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:41.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of his empathy.

00:15:41.711 --> 00:15:44.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
His compassion and fellow feeling

00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:47.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
just drew people to him like a magnet.

00:15:48.593 --> 00:15:52.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
What role
can our empathy and fellow feeling play

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:56.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we preach to others
in this loveless world?

00:15:57.393 --> 00:16:00.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take a look at the following dramatization.

00:17:08.423 --> 00:17:10.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, an everything bagel with cream cheese

00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:12.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a large latte—€8,50.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, I think I forgot my purse.

00:17:15.054 --> 00:17:16.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not my problem.

00:17:16.139 --> 00:17:17.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on. I’m here all the time.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been waiting forever.

00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:20.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet still not my problem.

00:17:20.727 --> 00:17:22.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:23.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can bring you the money after work.

00:17:24.564 --> 00:17:25.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next customer!

00:17:25.565 --> 00:17:27.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, how much was her order?

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:28.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
€8,50.

00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:29.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, I’ve got it.

00:17:29.736 --> 00:17:31.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And could you add a regular coffee with cream?

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:32.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fine—€12 even.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do I know you?

00:17:38.202 --> 00:17:40.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nope. I just wanted to help.

00:17:40.538 --> 00:17:41.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:42.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can I get your money to you?

00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, don’t worry about it.

00:17:45.126 --> 00:17:47.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Thank you!

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:18:01.935 --> 00:18:03.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you’d like a little something

00:18:03.436 --> 00:18:05.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
encouraging to read on your way to work,

00:18:05.438 --> 00:18:07.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might enjoy this.

00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:13.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t believe in God.

00:18:14.322 --> 00:18:16.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
May I ask why?

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:36.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just don’t.

00:18:38.054 --> 00:18:40.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
But thanks again. You’re very sweet.

00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:19.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mhm.

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:20.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mhm.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mhm. OK.

00:19:34.986 --> 00:19:37.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many years in the camp?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eleven.

00:19:40.908 --> 00:19:42.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will anyone else in your family

00:19:42.535 --> 00:19:44.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
be requesting resettlement?

00:19:44.912 --> 00:19:45.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:19:47.457 --> 00:19:48.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:53.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are all dead

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
—killed.

00:19:59.135 --> 00:20:01.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need a copy of your identity card.

00:20:19.363 --> 00:20:21.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, I saw your . . .

00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:23.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
No! We don’t hire foreigners!

00:20:23.576 --> 00:20:24.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
You ruined your country;

00:20:24.952 --> 00:20:26.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t come here and ruin ours!

00:20:26.621 --> 00:20:28.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get out!

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:08.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never underestimate the power of empathy!

00:22:08.139 --> 00:22:11.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even the smallest gesture
of kindness on our part

00:22:11.184 --> 00:22:14.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to someone
opening their heart to the truth.

00:22:15.646 --> 00:22:18.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
The video also taught us something else.

00:22:18.274 --> 00:22:20.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ministry, in all of its forms,

00:22:20.526 --> 00:22:23.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
can have a cumulative effect
on a person’s heart,

00:22:23.821 --> 00:22:28.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
softening it over time
to accept the Kingdom message.

00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:33.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we have empathy
not only for those in the field

00:22:33.414 --> 00:22:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for our own brothers and sisters

00:22:36.626 --> 00:22:39.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and that includes our young ones.

00:22:39.086 --> 00:22:41.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Day after day,

00:22:41.088 --> 00:22:43.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have to deal
with peer pressure at school,

00:22:43.883 --> 00:22:46.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s intense.

00:22:46.594 --> 00:22:49.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take it from Dilan and Isaac.

00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:54.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
They share their stories
in this episode of <i>My Teen Life.</i>

00:23:02.735 --> 00:23:04.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
I went to a vocational school

00:23:04.403 --> 00:23:05.905 line:10% position:50% align:center
where I was able to fast-track

00:23:05.905 --> 00:23:07.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
learning a trade.

00:23:07.114 --> 00:23:09.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unexpectedly,
I finished at the top of my class.

00:23:09.951 --> 00:23:12.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, my teachers and my classmates

00:23:12.536 --> 00:23:14.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to expect a lot more from me.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were saying: “You’re doing so well.

00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:18.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You represent the school.

00:23:18.876 --> 00:23:20.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will have to work hard.

00:23:20.586 --> 00:23:22.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ll do great things.

00:23:22.004 --> 00:23:23.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll go far.”

00:23:23.214 --> 00:23:25.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were constantly putting pressure on me

00:23:25.383 --> 00:23:28.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go for higher education
and to go to university.

00:23:28.636 --> 00:23:30.263 line:10% position:50% align:center
There was this girl

00:23:30.263 --> 00:23:31.889 line:10% position:50% align:center
in high school who was my age.

00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:33.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was very friendly.

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:37.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always paid attention to me;
she was a nice person.

00:23:37.186 --> 00:23:39.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also thought she was cute.

00:23:39.897 --> 00:23:43.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
My classmates were like: “Go, talk to her!”

00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:47.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Hey, Isaac,
do you know that she likes you?”

00:23:47.697 --> 00:23:49.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I wasn’t sure what to do.

00:23:50.491 --> 00:23:52.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, when I chose to go to that school,

00:23:52.785 --> 00:23:55.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
higher education wasn’t the reason.

00:23:55.162 --> 00:23:57.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to fast-track getting a trade

00:23:57.373 --> 00:24:00.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
and starting a job
so that I could earn my income.

00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:01.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what I thought.

00:24:01.794 --> 00:24:03.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a really difficult time for me.

00:24:05.548 --> 00:24:08.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember praying to Jehovah
in tears for hours.

00:24:10.136 --> 00:24:13.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t ask for advice,

00:24:13.097 --> 00:24:15.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t talk to friends
or people I trusted about it,

00:24:15.433 --> 00:24:17.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even my parents.

00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And little by little, I started to give in

00:24:21.188 --> 00:24:23.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that pressure that I got
because of this girl.

00:24:24.692 --> 00:24:27.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the end,
we started to flirt with each other.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
We chatted and sent each other messages.

00:24:33.868 --> 00:24:35.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I prayed to Jehovah,

00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:38.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t feel completely comfortable.

00:24:38.205 --> 00:24:41.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought, ‘If I’m not doing what Jehovah
is asking of me,

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:44.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘if I’m not behaving how Jehovah
expects me to behave,

00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:49.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
then how can I expect him to listen
to my prayers or even consider them?’

00:24:49.175 --> 00:24:52.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family never told me to go
or not to go to university,

00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:55.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they reminded me of Jehovah’s thinking.

00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:58.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad read Proverbs 27:11 to me.

00:24:59.518 --> 00:25:01.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I was doing was a barrier

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
between me and Jehovah.

00:25:02.855 --> 00:25:04.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped me see

00:25:04.148 --> 00:25:07.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the decisions I make as a teenager
affect Jehovah.

00:25:07.735 --> 00:25:10.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, there were many videos,

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:12.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
articles, and publications about this topic.

00:25:12.865 --> 00:25:16.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading experiences of those
who went through similar things,

00:25:16.369 --> 00:25:18.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing personal study on the subject,

00:25:18.913 --> 00:25:22.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking with spiritually mature brothers
while in the ministry

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
was very helpful for me.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that my parents did

00:25:26.712 --> 00:25:29.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helped me a lot
was that they used the book

00:25:29.715 --> 00:25:32.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Young People Ask </i> in our family study.

00:25:32.927 --> 00:25:35.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s a chapter
that talks about peer pressure.

00:25:41.018 --> 00:25:43.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Afterward, I was able to cope.

00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:46.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped me the most
was something I heard at a circuit assembly.

00:25:46.857 --> 00:25:50.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
The speaker said in his talk:
“Yes, our young people

00:25:50.111 --> 00:25:52.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have a lot of challenges right now.

00:25:52.947 --> 00:25:55.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And when it comes to higher education,

00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:57.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“maybe their classmates and teachers
are pressuring them.

00:25:57.952 --> 00:26:01.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But you young people
(it felt like he spoke to me personally),

00:26:01.664 --> 00:26:04.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your teacher or classmate might not even be

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“part of your life in the future.

00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:09.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But if you want Jehovah
always to be in your life,

00:26:09.505 --> 00:26:12.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you need
to make your decisions accordingly.”

00:26:14.927 --> 00:26:17.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a light went on in my head.

00:26:20.307 --> 00:26:23.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I was sure about what I needed to do.

00:26:23.018 --> 00:26:25.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to speak to her.

00:26:26.564 --> 00:26:30.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, I prayed to Jehovah
and got up the courage.

00:26:30.943 --> 00:26:33.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told her that it couldn’t continue with us.

00:26:34.738 --> 00:26:37.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, explaining that to my classmates

00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:39.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to my teachers was a little hard.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean,
it was difficult for them to understand.

00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:46.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure, I explained it, but they said,
“Why would you do that?”

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
For whoever is in the same situation
that I was in,

00:26:52.214 --> 00:26:53.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best thing to do

00:26:53.841 --> 00:26:57.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to talk to someone you trust,
tell them how you feel,

00:26:57.595 --> 00:26:59.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask for help.

00:27:06.145 --> 00:27:10.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Creator, Jehovah, is the one who thinks
about me and loves me most.

00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:15.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
He hasn’t deprived me of anything good.

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:18.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always helps us and never leaves us.

00:27:18.199 --> 00:27:20.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful to Jehovah.

00:27:42.264 --> 00:27:46.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dilan and Isaac both admitted
that the pressure they faced

00:27:46.936 --> 00:27:51.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
was almost too much,
almost got the best of them.

00:27:52.024 --> 00:27:54.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped them turn the corner?

00:27:55.152 --> 00:27:58.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac said that it was reaching out
and getting help.

00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:03.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re facing similar pressures in school,
don’t keep it to yourself.

00:28:03.619 --> 00:28:05.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to someone you trust

00:28:05.788 --> 00:28:10.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that can open the door
to getting just the help you need.

00:28:12.294 --> 00:28:15.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’d like to share
something special with you:

00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:20.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
a recent discovery that has rewritten
a part of our theocratic history.

00:28:21.637 --> 00:28:26.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy the following story,
more than 80 years in the making.

00:28:27.935 --> 00:28:30.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses love the Bible.

00:28:31.605 --> 00:28:34.275 line:10% position:50% align:center
Long before taking on the monumental task

00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:35.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Bible translation,

00:28:35.901 --> 00:28:37.653 line:10% position:50% align:center
they acquired licenses

00:28:37.653 --> 00:28:40.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
to print already existing translations
of the Bible.

00:28:41.073 --> 00:28:43.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in the 1950’s,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society 

00:28:45.244 --> 00:28:49.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
printed the first Bible
ever to be translated by Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:28:49.748 --> 00:28:52.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures.</i>

00:28:52.668 --> 00:28:55.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
At least we thought it was the first Bible

00:28:55.963 --> 00:28:58.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
ever to be translated by Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:28:58.549 --> 00:29:01.093 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, in the fall of 2017,

00:29:01.093 --> 00:29:03.304 line:10% position:50% align:center
the World Headquarters Museum Department

00:29:03.304 --> 00:29:04.513 line:10% position:50% align:center
received a Bible donated

00:29:04.513 --> 00:29:05.723 line:10% position:50% align:center
by a brother in Germany.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Accompanying the Bible was a letter referring

00:29:09.476 --> 00:29:13.480 line:10% position:50% align:center
to a rare Bible printed in 1934

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.441 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Magdeburg, the location

00:29:15.441 --> 00:29:17.651 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society’s

00:29:17.651 --> 00:29:20.279 line:10% position:50% align:center
Germany Branch and printery at that time.

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:22.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little was known about this Bible,

00:29:22.406 --> 00:29:26.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to those who did know of it,
it was thought of as something

00:29:26.285 --> 00:29:30.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
unapproved by the then-president
of the Society, J.F. Rutherford.

00:29:30.497 --> 00:29:34.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1934, Adolph Hitler’s campaign
against Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.962 line:10% position:50% align:center
was well underway.

00:29:36.962 --> 00:29:39.798 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our religious activities were banned,

00:29:39.798 --> 00:29:42.718 line:10% position:50% align:center
65 tons of literature had been seized

00:29:42.718 --> 00:29:46.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
and burned by Nazi authorities,
and the branch office and printery

00:29:46.472 --> 00:29:50.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Magdeburg had already been confiscated
and released several times.

00:29:53.562 --> 00:29:56.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this may explain why
the Magdeburger Bible

00:29:56.023 --> 00:29:59.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t have
a typical publishers’ page listing

00:29:59.234 --> 00:30:04.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
of who published it, who translated it,
when and where it was printed.

00:30:04.239 --> 00:30:08.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on the bottom of one of the last pages,

00:30:08.035 --> 00:30:12.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is just one line in small letters,
and it reads: 

00:30:12.206 --> 00:30:16.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Printed: Watchtower Bible and Tract Society,
Magdeburg.”

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, on September 13, 1934,

00:30:21.423 --> 00:30:24.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Ministry of the Interior
of the German government

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:26.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
granted permission for the Magdeburg office

00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:29.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
to resume
the printing and distribution of Bibles.

00:30:32.768 --> 00:30:36.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, everybody knew that the facilities
could be shut down again,

00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:39.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps permanently, at any time.

00:30:39.316 --> 00:30:42.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
What really could be accomplished
in the limited time they had?

00:30:43.445 --> 00:30:45.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Magdeburg office informed Rutherford

00:30:45.572 --> 00:30:47.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they had possession 

00:30:47.574 --> 00:30:51.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a New Testament manuscript
ready for printing and, additionally,

00:30:51.078 --> 00:30:54.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
a translation of the Old Testament
was nearly complete.

00:30:54.957 --> 00:30:57.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
In October 1934,

00:30:57.251 --> 00:31:00.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rutherford approved
the printing of 100,000 copies.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:05.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
But time was running out.

00:31:05.092 --> 00:31:09.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rutherford received
the following letter dated August 6, 1935,

00:31:09.513 --> 00:31:13.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it says: “In the afternoon of July 10th

00:31:13.434 --> 00:31:17.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a number of officials
of the secret Police of Berlin and Magdeburg

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:19.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“appeared and sealed the factory,

00:31:19.398 --> 00:31:23.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“rooms and offices at Magdeburg,
closed all factory rooms,

00:31:23.277 --> 00:31:24.611 line:10% position:50% align:center
“attached the property

00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:25.904 line:10% position:50% align:center
“and money of the Society . . .

00:31:25.904 --> 00:31:27.656 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Several thousand Bibles

00:31:27.656 --> 00:31:28.782 line:10% position:50% align:center
“were just been bound

00:31:28.782 --> 00:31:30.117 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the rest is printed.”

00:31:30.826 --> 00:31:33.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, only a small number

00:31:33.036 --> 00:31:36.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those Bibles
actually made it out of the printery.

00:31:36.457 --> 00:31:38.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
In November 2017,

00:31:38.792 --> 00:31:41.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
after a careful search,

00:31:41.086 --> 00:31:44.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were able to obtain three copies
of the Magdeburger Bible.

00:31:44.715 --> 00:31:48.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little did we know what a treasured place

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our organization’s history
of Bible translation

00:31:51.805 --> 00:31:54.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
and printing this Bible deserves!

00:31:55.392 --> 00:31:58.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a mere compilation
of existing translations

00:31:58.854 --> 00:32:02.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a fresh, unique translation of the Bible.

00:32:02.775 --> 00:32:06.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s name is used extensively

00:32:06.111 --> 00:32:07.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the text of the Hebrew Scriptures

00:32:07.529 --> 00:32:10.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as in footnotes
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:32:11.784 --> 00:32:14.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Magdeburger Bible was also

00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:17.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
cited in German-language editions
of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:19.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
And nearly a century later,

00:32:19.708 --> 00:32:23.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
the text can still be easily understood

00:32:23.295 --> 00:32:25.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the German reader.

00:32:25.339 --> 00:32:28.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible translation
truly has a remarkable story.

00:32:28.967 --> 00:32:33.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s print run was small
by normal Bible-printing standards,

00:32:33.514 --> 00:32:35.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its distribution was even smaller.

00:32:35.557 --> 00:32:38.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although it was produced in record time

00:32:38.393 --> 00:32:42.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
and under highly dangerous circumstances,
its story

00:32:42.523 --> 00:32:45.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
lay forgotten for decades
until it was rediscovered.

00:32:45.484 --> 00:32:49.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Magdeburger Bible
is the first-known Bible

00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:52.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be translated and published
by Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:56.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
predating the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures.</i>

00:32:56.453 --> 00:33:01.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was able to survive in a time
of Nazi government opposition

00:33:01.124 --> 00:33:03.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is now part of our
Bible Museum at Warwick.

00:33:04.628 --> 00:33:07.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible truly is a testimony

00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:11.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the words we find at Isaiah 40:8: 

00:33:12.511 --> 00:33:16.890 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>“Aber Jehovas Wort bleibt ewiglich!”</i>

00:33:24.147 --> 00:33:27.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not even the threat of Nazi oppression

00:33:27.192 --> 00:33:29.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
stopped our brothers in Germany

00:33:29.486 --> 00:33:33.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
from doing what they could
to make the Bible more available.

00:33:33.323 --> 00:33:34.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:33:34.783 --> 00:33:37.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because as Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:33:37.077 --> 00:33:40.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
we love the Bible
and love teaching others about it.

00:33:42.207 --> 00:33:46.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does it take
to be a good teacher of God’s Word?

00:33:47.129 --> 00:33:49.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a Morning Worship program,

00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:51.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Geoffrey Jackson discussed

00:33:51.633 --> 00:33:54.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we can learn from the apostle Paul

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how to reach the heart.

00:33:58.348 --> 00:34:01.727 line:10% position:50% align:center
How would you define a good teacher?

00:34:01.727 --> 00:34:04.104 line:10% position:50% align:center
That’s an interesting question, isn’t it?

00:34:04.104 --> 00:34:05.439 line:10% position:50% align:center
For many of us,

00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:08.066 line:10% position:50% align:center
perhaps we might answer by saying

00:34:08.066 --> 00:34:10.527 line:10% position:50% align:center
what we think a good speaker is like.

00:34:10.527 --> 00:34:11.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
We might say,

00:34:11.862 --> 00:34:15.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The brother uses 
many illustrations in his talk”

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:20.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “He was able to highlight a scripture
that I’ve read many times,

00:34:20.162 --> 00:34:22.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and yet for the first time,
I’ve seen something interesting

00:34:22.915 --> 00:34:25.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that that I’ve never seen before.”

00:34:25.292 --> 00:34:27.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps we might say,

00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:31.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was able to keep my interest
right through the 60 minutes.”

00:34:32.591 --> 00:34:35.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are all sorts of different ways

00:34:35.093 --> 00:34:38.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could say that someone is a good teacher.

00:34:38.597 --> 00:34:43.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the best compliment 
someone could receive is if they’re told

00:34:43.602 --> 00:34:46.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
that their teaching is similar
to that of Jesus Christ,

00:34:46.939 --> 00:34:51.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know he set
a wonderful example for all of us.

00:34:51.276 --> 00:34:54.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we’re
thinking about the qualifications

00:34:54.196 --> 00:34:56.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
for someone to be a good teacher,

00:34:56.281 --> 00:35:00.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s turn our attention
to the words of the apostle Paul.

00:35:00.202 --> 00:35:02.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you turn with me, please,

00:35:02.204 --> 00:35:07.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8,

00:35:07.918 --> 00:35:12.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
here we see, in addition to some 
of the matters that we just discussed,

00:35:12.798 --> 00:35:16.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
other aspects
or other qualities that are required

00:35:16.468 --> 00:35:19.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
for someone
really to be an effective teacher.

00:35:19.638 --> 00:35:22.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s 1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8:

00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:28.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the contrary, 
we became gentle in your midst,

00:35:28.855 --> 00:35:33.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as when a nursing mother 
tenderly cares for her own children.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So having tender affection for you,

00:35:35.988 --> 00:35:39.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we were determined to impart to you,

00:35:39.157 --> 00:35:44.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only the good news of God
but also our very selves.”

00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:48.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you notice
some of the qualities, or attributes,

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
here that the apostle Paul mentions

00:35:50.335 --> 00:35:53.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
as being very important
with regard to our teaching?

00:35:53.922 --> 00:35:58.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 8, it mentions “tender affection.”

00:35:58.176 --> 00:36:01.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
So love is very much connected

00:36:01.847 --> 00:36:05.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
with someone 
having the ability to be a good teacher.

00:36:05.475 --> 00:36:08.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, to reach the heart of the student,

00:36:08.812 --> 00:36:11.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to display love as well, don’t we?

00:36:11.732 --> 00:36:16.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without reaching the heart 
of the student we’re trying to teach,

00:36:16.278 --> 00:36:20.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s like enjoying a meal in a dream.

00:36:20.991 --> 00:36:23.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
There really is no benefit at all.

00:36:23.577 --> 00:36:27.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we teach
but don’t reach the heart of the student,

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
then it really is 
of very little value to the student.

00:36:30.917 --> 00:36:33.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then looking on, notice it says that Paul

00:36:33.837 --> 00:36:36.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
was “determined to impart”

00:36:36.548 --> 00:36:39.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just the message of the good news

00:36:39.509 --> 00:36:42.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his very self.

00:36:42.054 --> 00:36:46.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, 
he put his whole heart into teaching others.

00:36:47.517 --> 00:36:49.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s look up at verse 7.

00:36:49.644 --> 00:36:53.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I feel quite confident
in saying that probably none of us

00:36:53.398 --> 00:36:57.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
would have listed this quality
as being essential for a good teacher.

00:36:57.402 --> 00:36:59.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he start?

00:36:59.404 --> 00:37:02.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We became gentle in your midst.”

00:37:02.741 --> 00:37:06.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, honestly,
that probably isn’t the first quality

00:37:06.036 --> 00:37:09.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would come to your mind 
with regard to a teacher.

00:37:09.873 --> 00:37:14.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s meant
by this expression to be “gentle”?

00:37:14.086 --> 00:37:17.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one Bible scholar made this comment.

00:37:17.255 --> 00:37:20.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that this word 
that’s translated “gentle”

00:37:20.467 --> 00:37:23.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was frequently used by Greek writers

00:37:23.804 --> 00:37:28.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as characterizing
a nurse with trying children

00:37:28.683 --> 00:37:32.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a teacher with refractory scholars.”

00:37:32.395 --> 00:37:36.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I had to look up the word “refractory”
and add it to my vocabulary.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means, basically, “difficult to control,

00:37:40.946 --> 00:37:45.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
resisting authority, 
unmanageable, unresponsive.”

00:37:46.785 --> 00:37:50.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, do we see an interesting thought here?

00:37:50.372 --> 00:37:55.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
This gentleness 
has a firmness and stability about it

00:37:55.377 --> 00:37:58.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
that isn’t rocked or shaken easily

00:37:58.755 --> 00:38:03.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the negative response 
of the one that’s being taught.

00:38:03.176 --> 00:38:05.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that an interesting quality?

00:38:05.595 --> 00:38:08.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt we’ve all tried to display that,

00:38:08.974 --> 00:38:13.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps as we’re trying to teach
someone something about the Scriptures

00:38:13.645 --> 00:38:18.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come across the thought 
that this person doesn’t really accept it.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
We state the fact,

00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:24.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show our scripture, 
but they still may have a problem.

00:38:24.698 --> 00:38:26.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how do we react?

00:38:26.825 --> 00:38:31.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, if we were to demand 
that they accept what we say

00:38:31.204 --> 00:38:34.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we said it 
or because the Scriptures say it

00:38:34.749 --> 00:38:37.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
without reasoning with that person,

00:38:37.419 --> 00:38:41.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
then, really, we don’t have that gentleness

00:38:41.173 --> 00:38:44.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the apostle Paul is referring to here.

00:38:44.551 --> 00:38:47.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that stability under pressure

00:38:47.804 --> 00:38:52.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a loving way convinces someone

00:38:52.809 --> 00:38:57.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
of something that perhaps
they’re not so responsive to.

00:38:57.022 --> 00:38:59.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t that open our minds

00:38:59.024 --> 00:39:02.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
to another aspect
of what is involved with good teaching?

00:39:02.986 --> 00:39:07.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, by contrast, if we look back
at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:12.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see that the apostle Paul
in verses 5 and 6

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us a contrast about the type of things

00:39:14.748 --> 00:39:18.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we wouldn’t want to do as a teacher.

00:39:18.543 --> 00:39:22.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that in verses 5 and 6:

00:39:22.047 --> 00:39:27.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In fact, you know that we never
used flattering speech

00:39:27.093 --> 00:39:30.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or put on any false front
with greedy motives;

00:39:30.472 --> 00:39:32.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is witness!

00:39:32.515 --> 00:39:35.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Nor have we been seeking glory from men,

00:39:35.727 --> 00:39:38.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“either from you or from others,

00:39:38.355 --> 00:39:41.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
though we could be 
an expensive burden as apostles of Christ.”

00:39:43.193 --> 00:39:47.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are these negative things
that we certainly would want to avoid

00:39:47.197 --> 00:39:49.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
if want to be an effective teacher?

00:39:49.991 --> 00:39:53.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice that first one, 
“flattering speech.”

00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:55.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this reminds us of another scripture.

00:39:55.872 --> 00:40:00.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn across to Proverbs 28:23,

00:40:00.877 --> 00:40:03.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is a good reminder for all of us.

00:40:04.506 --> 00:40:08.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Whoever reproves a man

00:40:08.093 --> 00:40:10.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or corrects his thinking]

00:40:10.637 --> 00:40:13.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will afterward find more favor

00:40:13.598 --> 00:40:16.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
than someone who flatters with his tongue.”

00:40:17.602 --> 00:40:20.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the point that is being made there?

00:40:20.939 --> 00:40:25.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
That flattery is not really an effective way

00:40:25.068 --> 00:40:28.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to gain someone’s confidence,

00:40:28.488 --> 00:40:32.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, it’s by honestly correcting
the thinking of someone else.

00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:37.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with our Bible students or whatever level 
of teaching that we’re doing,

00:40:37.998 --> 00:40:42.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to remember
that part of the process of teaching involves

00:40:42.669 --> 00:40:47.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving counsel or direction
in correcting wrong viewpoints.

00:40:47.632 --> 00:40:50.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
For us not to do that in a loving way

00:40:50.677 --> 00:40:54.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
really shows that we don’t love
the person properly

00:40:54.389 --> 00:40:58.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we don’t really want them 
to change their wrong thinking.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
So avoiding “flattering speech”
is very important.

00:41:02.689 --> 00:41:06.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Going back to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:41:06.318 --> 00:41:08.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s the second point that Paul mentions?

00:41:08.987 --> 00:41:12.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
A “false front with greedy motives.”

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:18.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a false front is pretending
to be someone that you’re not.

00:41:18.705 --> 00:41:22.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
So none of us would ever want to put across

00:41:22.292 --> 00:41:24.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
a self-righteous viewpoint

00:41:24.544 --> 00:41:29.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to convince others
that we are holier than they are,

00:41:29.132 --> 00:41:31.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as it says here, 
it’s to not have that “false front.”

00:41:31.801 --> 00:41:35.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it mentions “greedy motives.”

00:41:35.263 --> 00:41:37.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, there’s a marginal reference

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:42.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
that takes us across to Acts 20:33.

00:41:42.312 --> 00:41:44.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
There the apostle Paul says:

00:41:44.356 --> 00:41:48.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have desired 
no man’s silver or gold or clothing.”

00:41:49.694 --> 00:41:53.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
So certainly as a teacher of the good news,

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:58.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t want to expect 
some benefits or something

00:41:58.203 --> 00:42:01.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would come back to us
by means of our teaching.

00:42:01.623 --> 00:42:05.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
There the apostle Paul 
sets a good standard for us.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 6,

00:42:08.296 --> 00:42:11.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said that he wasn’t 
‘seeking the glory of men,’

00:42:11.674 --> 00:42:16.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
or as one translation says,
“insisting on our own dignity.”

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it could be that if we’re a teacher,

00:42:20.767 --> 00:42:25.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may feel that we deserve
a certain measure of respect.

00:42:25.772 --> 00:42:30.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our position 
is a little higher than the student.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we really feel that way deep inside,

00:42:33.571 --> 00:42:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s going to affect our attitude

00:42:36.699 --> 00:42:38.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to being gentle, won’t it?

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:42.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because if someone questions what we say

00:42:42.372 --> 00:42:46.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if it looks like they’re not dignifying us 
in a proper manner,

00:42:46.459 --> 00:42:49.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we will lose that firm gentleness

00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:52.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps correct the thinking of others.

00:42:53.466 --> 00:42:57.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when we think about all these
various attributes and qualities

00:42:57.262 --> 00:43:00.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are needed for us to be a good teacher,

00:43:00.181 --> 00:43:03.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps we might feel 
that there’s a lot we can work on, I’m sure.

00:43:03.435 --> 00:43:04.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that way as well.

00:43:04.936 --> 00:43:08.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a continual battle
—isn’t it?—for us to continue

00:43:08.022 --> 00:43:10.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to be effective teachers.

00:43:10.692 --> 00:43:15.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is one word of encouragement
we gain from the book of Philippians.

00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:17.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a final scripture,

00:43:17.282 --> 00:43:21.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians 2:13:

00:43:21.953 --> 00:43:27.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For God is the one who for the sake
of his good pleasure energizes you,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“giving you both [notice] the desire

00:43:30.336 --> 00:43:34.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[yes, so the desire 
for us to impart the truth

00:43:34.174 --> 00:43:37.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a loving manner to others and then also]

00:43:37.135 --> 00:43:39.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the power to act.”

00:43:39.137 --> 00:43:42.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as we consider our teaching abilities,

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:45.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t just think of techniques.

00:43:45.059 --> 00:43:48.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
But always remember 
that when we’re a good teacher,

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to be gentle in the midst of others

00:43:51.816 --> 00:43:55.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help them in a loving way
to correct wrong thoughts.

00:43:56.988 --> 00:44:01.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jesus,
Paul put his whole heart into his teaching.

00:44:02.368 --> 00:44:04.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
His concern for others moved him

00:44:04.412 --> 00:44:07.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the good news
with as many as possible.

00:44:08.958 --> 00:44:12.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
In modern times,
many have shown that same spirit,

00:44:12.629 --> 00:44:17.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
moving them to preach
even in the face of opposition.

00:44:17.592 --> 00:44:20.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those sisters is Maria Kaloyanoff.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my mother was born
in the country of Bulgaria in 1922,

00:44:27.644 --> 00:44:30.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the early 1950’s,

00:44:30.313 --> 00:44:34.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
my family emigrated
from Germany to the United States.

00:44:34.776 --> 00:44:36.778 line:10% position:50% align:center
We settled in New York City,

00:44:36.778 --> 00:44:38.655 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it was there that my mother

00:44:38.655 --> 00:44:40.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
learned the truth.

00:44:40.073 --> 00:44:43.368 line:10% position:50% align:center
That is the first time I opened a Bible.

00:44:43.368 --> 00:44:47.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went and opened Revelation chapter 21.

00:44:48.373 --> 00:44:51.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what hit me was the point

00:44:51.584 --> 00:44:53.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there will not be sickness,

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
sorrow, and death anymore.

00:44:57.966 --> 00:45:00.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone that comes into the truth

00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:03.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
wants to share that with their family.

00:45:03.179 --> 00:45:05.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a desire,

00:45:05.348 --> 00:45:08.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
really, to tell them the truth,

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they can get free

00:45:11.312 --> 00:45:16.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
from oppression and sickness and death.

00:45:17.402 --> 00:45:20.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she very much saw the need and desired

00:45:20.488 --> 00:45:23.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have literature in the Bulgarian language.

00:45:24.784 --> 00:45:27.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was able to ask the brothers in Brooklyn,

00:45:27.745 --> 00:45:30.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
specifically offering if she could

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:34.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
translate some literature into Bulgarian.

00:45:34.085 --> 00:45:36.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers approved for her to do that,

00:45:36.588 --> 00:45:40.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting out with some of the tracts.

00:45:41.384 --> 00:45:46.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Bulgaria was behind the Iron Curtain,
a Communist country.

00:45:46.014 --> 00:45:48.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Literature about God and the Bible

00:45:48.433 --> 00:45:52.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not acceptable and banned,

00:45:52.353 --> 00:45:54.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
so you can’t just mail it.

00:45:54.939 --> 00:45:59.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as literature became available,
people have to take it in.

00:46:00.194 --> 00:46:04.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family was one of those families
that volunteered to do that.

00:46:04.532 --> 00:46:08.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
We traveled into Bulgaria by train.

00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:12.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a lot of luggage because every time
we would go to Bulgaria,

00:46:12.707 --> 00:46:14.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
we stayed two and a half months.

00:46:14.709 --> 00:46:17.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the summer vacation.

00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:21.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that luggage, in various places,

00:46:23.134 --> 00:46:25.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
we put literature.

00:46:25.136 --> 00:46:29.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Traveling into a country
with banned literature

00:46:29.474 --> 00:46:34.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not without its problems or dangers.

00:46:34.062 --> 00:46:38.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew that we had some literature,
and that was the tracts.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:43.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother realized
that we were going to be searched.

00:46:43.488 --> 00:46:47.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had the ability

00:46:47.116 --> 00:46:51.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the literature
out of each luggage that we had hidden it in

00:46:51.287 --> 00:46:55.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to put it into one small briefcase.

00:46:55.708 --> 00:46:57.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what we couldn’t,

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
like unfolded tracts,

00:47:00.129 --> 00:47:02.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
we put around our arm

00:47:02.382 --> 00:47:05.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our overcoats over it.

00:47:05.677 --> 00:47:08.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was only worrying about how I can

00:47:08.763 --> 00:47:13.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
hide that literature so he cannot find it.

00:47:13.142 --> 00:47:15.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because if he finds it,

00:47:15.561 --> 00:47:18.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
then there really are consequences.

00:47:18.648 --> 00:47:21.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the guards would search
through the luggage,

00:47:21.317 --> 00:47:22.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would rifle through it.

00:47:22.902 --> 00:47:24.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t straighten anything out,

00:47:24.529 --> 00:47:27.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
so my mother quickly thought and asked them,

00:47:27.782 --> 00:47:30.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Can I now go over there and straighten out

00:47:30.243 --> 00:47:32.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you’ve messed up?”

00:47:32.995 --> 00:47:35.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they said, “OK.”

00:47:35.164 --> 00:47:38.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
I took my tracts,

00:47:38.292 --> 00:47:41.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
which I had around my hand,

00:47:41.087 --> 00:47:46.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I put them in the already
checked bag over there.

00:47:46.718 --> 00:47:51.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the guards gets to the point
that it’s my little briefcase.

00:47:52.724 --> 00:47:54.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says,

00:47:54.308 --> 00:47:56.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is so small;

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:58.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
nothing could be in here!”

00:47:58.646 --> 00:48:00.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he just takes it over there.

00:48:02.483 --> 00:48:06.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man who was looking
was getting very nervous

00:48:06.237 --> 00:48:09.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he knew we had something,

00:48:09.031 --> 00:48:11.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was not able to find it.

00:48:14.662 --> 00:48:18.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in one trip years later,
my mother was on her own.

00:48:19.459 --> 00:48:23.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
The officials at the border
of Bulgaria found literature.

00:48:23.838 --> 00:48:26.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
They arrested her.

00:48:26.174 --> 00:48:28.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
They put her in prison.

00:48:28.801 --> 00:48:33.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
They interrogated her for two weeks
or more every day.

00:48:35.266 --> 00:48:39.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in time,
the Bulgarian government changed their mind

00:48:39.729 --> 00:48:42.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decided that as a foreign national,

00:48:42.565 --> 00:48:45.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would just expel her from the country.

00:48:47.695 --> 00:48:51.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
To this day,
my mother continues her spiritual routine

00:48:51.073 --> 00:48:53.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
of worshipping Jehovah

00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:57.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being at the meetings, preparing
for the meetings, reading her Bible,

00:48:57.997 --> 00:49:02.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and zealously sharing the truth with others.

00:49:02.043 --> 00:49:05.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps me practically

00:49:05.046 --> 00:49:07.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
every minute in my life.

00:49:07.423 --> 00:49:12.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I want to use my last bit of energy

00:49:13.346 --> 00:49:16.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make his will known.

00:49:20.019 --> 00:49:23.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once Sister Kaloyanoff
heard the Bible’s message,

00:49:23.731 --> 00:49:26.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
she just had to share it
with those in her home country.

00:49:28.194 --> 00:49:32.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
As she’s gotten older,
her circumstances have changed,

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not her determination.

00:49:34.742 --> 00:49:37.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
She still wants to do whatever she can,

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:41.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
using her ‘last energy,’ as she put it,

00:49:41.207 --> 00:49:43.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make God’s will known.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:48.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have faithful ones
like Sister Kaloyanoff in your congregation?

00:49:49.048 --> 00:49:53.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep them in mind
as you enjoy this month’s music video.

00:49:53.803 --> 00:49:57.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called <i>Two Small Coins.</i>

00:50:10.611 --> 00:50:19.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two small coins
Are all that she can give.

00:50:21.914 --> 00:50:32.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
As she waits,
The courtyard echoes with bountiful gifts.

00:50:33.259 --> 00:50:42.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lost in the crowd,
Like a single grain of sand,

00:50:43.728 --> 00:50:56.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will her Father take note
Of the two small coins in her hand?

00:50:58.075 --> 00:51:04.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how small,
Don’t wonder at all,

00:51:04.999 --> 00:51:09.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’

00:51:09.378 --> 00:51:16.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not hard to believe
If we see how he sees—

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:23.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we see
through Jehovah’s eyes—

00:51:23.517 --> 00:51:28.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two small coins.

00:51:32.777 --> 00:51:42.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she have thought
Of all she’d given before—

00:51:43.579 --> 00:51:54.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of easier times
When she had the means to give so much more?

00:51:55.049 --> 00:52:04.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
She drops in her coins,
Unheard by others around.

00:52:05.643 --> 00:52:19.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for Jehovah God,
This small gift made a thunderous sound.

00:52:20.491 --> 00:52:27.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how small,
Don’t wonder at all,

00:52:27.206 --> 00:52:31.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’

00:52:31.919 --> 00:52:38.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not hard to believe
If we see how he sees—

00:52:38.926 --> 00:52:45.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we see
through Jehovah’s eyes—

00:52:45.933 --> 00:52:48.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two small coins.

00:52:48.978 --> 00:52:55.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
He looks far beyond
what you and I see.

00:52:55.067 --> 00:53:02.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows
who we really are underneath.

00:53:02.408 --> 00:53:08.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees
all we can be.

00:53:10.249 --> 00:53:17.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how small,
Don’t wonder at all,

00:53:17.131 --> 00:53:21.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’

00:53:21.635 --> 00:53:28.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not hard to believe
If we see how he sees—

00:53:28.476 --> 00:53:36.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we see
through Jehovah’s eyes—

00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:40.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two small coins.

00:53:45.534 --> 00:53:52.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see
through Jehovah’s eyes?

00:53:55.419 --> 00:53:57.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful reassurance

00:53:57.671 --> 00:54:00.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no matter what our limitations may be,

00:54:00.966 --> 00:54:05.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
our gifts have great value in Jehovah’s eyes!

00:54:06.597 --> 00:54:09.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this month’s video postcard,

00:54:09.391 --> 00:54:13.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s travel to a land
of incredible scenic beauty

00:54:13.395 --> 00:54:15.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
—New Zealand.

00:54:16.315 --> 00:54:20.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
New Zealand is made up
primarily of two main islands

00:54:20.027 --> 00:54:24.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 1,600 kilometers,
or more than 1,000 miles,

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
southeast of Australia.

00:54:27.618 --> 00:54:31.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
On those islands,
you’ll find snowcapped mountain ranges,

00:54:31.163 --> 00:54:33.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
crystal clear lakes,

00:54:34.834 --> 00:54:37.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
miles of beaches,
and a sweeping coastline

00:54:37.795 --> 00:54:40.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
with many harbors and fjords.

00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:42.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also an area

00:54:42.675 --> 00:54:45.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
of dramatic geothermal activity,

00:54:45.344 --> 00:54:48.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
with active volcanoes, geysers,

00:54:48.806 --> 00:54:51.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
bubbling mud pools,

00:54:51.308 --> 00:54:55.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one of the largest hot springs
in the world,

00:54:55.104 --> 00:54:58.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fittingly named Frying Pan Lake.

00:54:59.608 --> 00:55:03.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Residents of New Zealand
are often nicknamed “Kiwis”

00:55:03.737 --> 00:55:08.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a nod to one of the country’s
most unique indigenous birds,

00:55:08.075 --> 00:55:11.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
the long-billed and flightless kiwi.

00:55:12.288 --> 00:55:17.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news first reached New Zealand
in the late 1890’s

00:55:17.084 --> 00:55:19.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
when one local reader
of the Watch Tower publications

00:55:19.795 --> 00:55:22.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
started preaching on his own.

00:55:23.716 --> 00:55:25.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few years later,

00:55:25.134 --> 00:55:28.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
colporteurs from Australia
and the United States arrived,

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the good news began to spread.

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:33.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
The early Witnesses in New Zealand

00:55:33.642 --> 00:55:36.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
were intrepid preachers,

00:55:36.228 --> 00:55:40.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
crossing rugged terrain on foot, horseback,

00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:43.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bicycle to reach remote towns.

00:55:44.695 --> 00:55:46.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
One New Zealander

00:55:46.322 --> 00:55:48.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
who became a zealous preacher
in those early days

00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:50.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
was William Barry,

00:55:50.618 --> 00:55:55.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
who read the six volumes
of <i>Studies in the Scriptures</i>  in 1909

00:55:55.289 --> 00:55:58.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and immediately recognized
he had found the truth.

00:55:59.293 --> 00:56:02.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
He diligently taught the truth
to his children.

00:56:02.046 --> 00:56:05.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 1975,
his son Lloyd Barry

00:56:05.466 --> 00:56:08.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
became a member of the Governing Body.

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth has also spread quickly
among the Maori,

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
the indigenous people of New Zealand.

00:56:15.559 --> 00:56:19.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first Maori-language convention
was held in 1928.

00:56:20.397 --> 00:56:23.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today,
we have many Maori brothers and sisters

00:56:23.901 --> 00:56:26.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
who enjoy sharing their rich culture
with others.

00:56:28.864 --> 00:56:32.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Altogether, there are now
more than 15,000 publishers in New Zealand,

00:56:32.952 --> 00:56:36.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaching in 18 different languages,

00:56:36.038 --> 00:56:39.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
including New Zealand Sign Language.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here on the South Island
is the seaside town of Picton

00:56:44.964 --> 00:56:47.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
—home to the Picton Congregation.

00:56:47.633 --> 00:56:50.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a busy waterfront and ferry terminal,

00:56:50.594 --> 00:56:53.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Picton welcomes many tourists

00:56:53.472 --> 00:56:55.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and international workers,

00:56:55.683 --> 00:56:57.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
so there are plenty of opportunities

00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:59.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
for public witnessing.

00:57:00.562 --> 00:57:04.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
To reach those living in homes
around the many bays of Picton,

00:57:04.608 --> 00:57:08.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
the preaching work involves
using boats owned by brothers.

00:57:09.863 --> 00:57:13.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 39 publishers and the pioneers
in the Picton Congregation

00:57:13.617 --> 00:57:16.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their love and greetings.

00:57:17.204 --> 00:57:20.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:57:20.374 --> 00:57:24.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is, yes, this is JW Broadcasting!
