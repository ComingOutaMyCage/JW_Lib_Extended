Welcome to JW Broadcasting®

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
for January 2023!

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:28.278 line:10% position:50% align:center
On October 1, 2022,

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.346 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:31.648 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Pennsylvania

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:33.416 line:10% position:50% align:center
held its annual meeting,

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the most exciting events
on our theocratic calendar.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are delighted to share
this special meeting with all of you.

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:46.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy Part 1
of this beautiful program.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s our pleasure

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
to welcome all of you
to the annual meeting

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:57.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society
of Pennsylvania.

00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:01.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s been a hard year,

00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:05.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
very hard for many.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some are mourning the loss of loved ones.

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others are concerned
about the health of family members

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe of their own health.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:22.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still others have lost everything they own

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:26.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a fire, a flood, or a hurricane.

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:32.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you lose your home
in a natural disaster,

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:35.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
usually you lose your job too.

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:38.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
If your home has been affected,
your place of work is affected.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:41.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many of these folks

00:01:41.217 --> 00:01:45.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
won’t have any way to get their home back

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:47.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they have no job.

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:50.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s been a tough year.

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:54.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of us need encouragement.

00:01:54.063 --> 00:01:57.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it’s our prayer
that by the end of this program,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to feel encouraged,
spiritually built up,

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:04.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and absolutely convinced

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no matter what has happened

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what is going to happen,

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:11.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is going to help you through

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and He’s going to take care of you.

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:17.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the program is going
to feature a number of videos

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
interspersed with talks
from various members of the Governing Body.

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know
what they’re going to talk about,

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:26.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they certainly have chosen
some interesting themes.

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:30.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to be on the edge of my seat
to see what they have to tell us.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:33.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first up is a video

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
on one of our favorite subjects

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Caleb and Sophia.

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:41.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just so you know,
Caleb is not a member of the Governing Body,

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:45.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he’s going to be
on the program anyway.

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:46.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is the longer version.

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:49.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
They call it the epic version.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s part of the series
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend.</i>

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:56.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the title is
<i>Who Should Be My Friend?</i>

00:02:56.893 --> 00:02:58.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
You got this!
Come on!

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go, go, go!

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:11.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:12.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bro, that was good!

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hurry up, we’re gonna be late!

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:39.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, let’s go!

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Woo!

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:52.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he called them his friends.

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see throughout the Gospel accounts
that those

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
who chose to befriend Jesus
gained the best friend possible.

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:08.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey there!

00:04:08.698 --> 00:04:10.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you like to draw?

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:15.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like your notes.

00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:16.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really cool.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:19.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom taught me.

00:04:19.242 --> 00:04:21.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pictures help me remember.

00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:22.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too.

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:26.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it looks like we have a talk together.

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:27.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:29.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll be in touch to practice soon.

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:31.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lydia, we’re leaving.

00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I gotta go.

00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you later, Sophia.

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:41.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, bro.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, good to see you.

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:46.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad I was on your team.

00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:50.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
My favorite thing was the safari tree house.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah! It had all
the cool jungle animals on the wall.

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:57.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Timmy, I didn’t think your team
was gonna make it.

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:01.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love my prize.

00:05:02.452 --> 00:05:04.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
You got a prize?

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all did.

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:20.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Umm.
Hehe.

00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:27.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, kids, settle down.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s time to get started.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a lot to talk about today.

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:38.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we begin,

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:42.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those of you that participated
in the Science Club this weekend,

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:45.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be having another camping trip.

00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:49.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
But only the ones
with the highest score on the math project

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:51.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be selected to go.

00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:53.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
More on that after class.

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:55.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Sophia.

00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:56.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need you in our club.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re good at science.

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:00.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have another trip coming up.

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:11.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Sophia!

00:06:11.654 --> 00:06:12.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come with us.

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:22.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
So anyway, all the kids had badges
and prizes and stuff,

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:26.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it sounded like a lot of fun.

00:06:27.837 --> 00:06:30.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it seems like they really need my help.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.
I see.

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you see what’s wrong with the car?

00:06:37.914 --> 00:06:39.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I wish.

00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:42.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I see why you want to be in the club.

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:44.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
You do?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all want to have friends
and do fun things.

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, would you mind moving
the light over here?

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:53.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, right there, thank you.

00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:02.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just wish I had some kid friends.

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:05.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants you and me to have friends.

00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:12.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question you need to ask yourself is,
‘Who should be my friend?’

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:17.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about it
at our next family worship.

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:21.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about you go do some research on Martha.

00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:26.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will tell Caleb too.

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:31.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we can come back together
and talk about it as a family.

00:07:35.838 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sophia, are you ready?

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:38.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:41.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Martha.

00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:46.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Jewess, the sister of Lazarus and Mary.”

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lived in Bethany,

00:07:51.487 --> 00:07:55.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a village ‘about two miles’ away
from Jerusalem,”

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:59.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was probably Jesus’ home base
when he came down from Galilee.

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:01.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha liked to cook.

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:04.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, she did.

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she would cook for Jesus

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all his disciples when they would visit.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:12.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:15.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would have been a lot of food.

00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:18.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and a lot of work.

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:23.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if they work together,
they’d make it a success.

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:26.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, some of their friends

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:28.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt differently about Jesus.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha makes the best apricot cakes.

00:08:39.802 --> 00:08:41.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just a fact.

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:43.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve always praised me too much, Talia.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if it gets me more apricot cakes,
I will continue to praise you.

00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:53.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh Talia, did you hear?

00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:56.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Teacher, Jesus,
he’s coming back to visit.

00:08:57.753 --> 00:08:59.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man from Galilee?

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:03.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you— Are you hosting him again?

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:05.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I am.

00:09:05.661 --> 00:09:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, it’s tonight.

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:10.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve heard a lot of talk.

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:14.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pharisees in Jerusalem,
they don’t approve of that man.

00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:18.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am not sure it’s such a good idea
for you to be known as his friend.

00:09:22.044 --> 00:09:25.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, well, I guess I better be getting home.

00:09:25.848 --> 00:09:27.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you two later.

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:51.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha!
Jesus is here.

00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:46.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:48.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me get this straight.

00:10:48.097 --> 00:10:49.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted you and Mary

00:10:49.598 --> 00:10:52.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
to sit and learn about God just like the men?

00:10:53.336 --> 00:10:55.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
A teacher instructing women?

00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
A woman’s job
is to provide food for her household.

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:00.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true!

00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:05.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good woman
“prepares herself for hard work.”

00:11:05.014 --> 00:11:06.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s valuable.

00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:07.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s you, Martha.

00:11:09.218 --> 00:11:11.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let this Jesus ruin you with his ideas.

00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:23.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lazarus!

00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:38.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
So kind of you.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is he doing?

00:11:40.182 --> 00:11:41.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not well.

00:11:42.184 --> 00:11:44.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sent word to Jesus.

00:11:44.053 --> 00:11:45.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will help my brother.

00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:47.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
You sent word to Jesus?

00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:50.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you still not heard?

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:54.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s angering people
with his shocking speech.

00:11:54.196 --> 00:11:56.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s claiming to be God’s Son.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:58.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s crazy!

00:11:58.701 --> 00:12:02.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s loyal to Jehovah, and he is our friend.

00:12:10.613 --> 00:12:12.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, Lazarus died.

00:12:17.086 --> 00:12:20.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you remember what happened next?

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:24.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus came back to Bethany
and resurrected Lazarus.

00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:28.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was a real friend.

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:31.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
He cared about Martha, Mary, and Lazarus,

00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:36.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he showed them
what kind of Friend Jehovah can be to us.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s not where this story ends.

00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:42.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know what some people did after that?

00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:45.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many of the Jews . . .
who saw what he did put faith in him, 

00:12:46.782 --> 00:12:50.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but some of them went off to the Pharisees

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:52.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and told them what Jesus had done.”

00:12:52.788 --> 00:12:54.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did they do that?

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because not even seeing Jesus
bring someone back to life

00:12:59.295 --> 00:13:02.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
was enough to convince them
that he was the Christ.

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:07.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seemed like Martha’s friends,

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:09.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they hated Jesus.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you think Martha dealt
with her unbelieving friends?

00:13:18.347 --> 00:13:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is the Christ,
“the resurrection and the life.”

00:13:22.418 --> 00:13:24.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is the Son of God.

00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:27.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he is my friend.

00:13:31.126 --> 00:13:34.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talia, you’ve been kind to me in the past.

00:13:34.363 --> 00:13:37.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you don’t believe Jesus’ teachings.

00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:39.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cannot be friends.

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:52.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha stuck with Jesus and his friends.

00:13:53.849 --> 00:13:56.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped her become Jehovah’s friend.

00:14:09.965 --> 00:14:11.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, Sophia,

00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:15.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do you think Jehovah is teaching you
about friendship?

00:14:16.805 --> 00:14:20.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
That I have to choose my friends carefully.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can you know
if someone should be your friend?

00:14:24.914 --> 00:14:27.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they help me be Jehovah’s friend.

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:32.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not going to join the club.

00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:34.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s my girl.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:37.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so proud of you, Sophia.

00:14:38.227 --> 00:14:40.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah is proud of you too.

00:14:41.263 --> 00:14:44.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, 
how about you go finish up your homework?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom tells me we have a guest coming over.

00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:48.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:14:56.278 --> 00:14:59.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, please help me find a good friend,

00:14:59.915 --> 00:15:01.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who loves you.

00:15:07.289 --> 00:15:09.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
At least you’re my friend.

00:15:12.127 --> 00:15:13.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sophia!

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lydia is here.

00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our talk!

00:15:24.873 --> 00:15:26.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you like turtles?

00:15:26.575 --> 00:15:28.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love turtles!

00:15:29.044 --> 00:15:30.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:36.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got something I want to show you.

00:15:39.922 --> 00:15:43.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is so cute.

00:15:47.496 --> 00:15:50.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Sophia,
I think we’re going to be friends.

00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:54.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yup, definitely friends.

00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:08.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Admit it.

00:16:08.717 --> 00:16:12.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
You enjoy watching Caleb and Sophia
just as much as the kids do.

00:16:12.788 --> 00:16:17.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know,
because we get letters from adults.

00:16:18.093 --> 00:16:20.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re going to enjoy
the first of the talks

00:16:20.462 --> 00:16:22.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
by members of the Governing Body,

00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:25.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this one will be delivered
by Brother Gerrit Lösch.

00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:27.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has a very interesting theme

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Supported
by the ‘Pillar . . . of the Truth.’”

00:16:31.373 --> 00:16:33.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lösch, please.

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:39.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is the following statement true or false?

00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:42.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Truth is relative.”

00:16:43.185 --> 00:16:47.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
That statement
is not relatively but absolutely false.

00:16:47.623 --> 00:16:51.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some think
that something is truth for one person

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:54.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not truth for another person.

00:16:54.496 --> 00:16:58.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many religious organizations
claim to have the truth.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:03.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, between them
there are many contradicting teachings.

00:17:04.506 --> 00:17:09.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just another evidence
that all truth is relative

00:17:09.044 --> 00:17:11.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that there is no absolute truth?

00:17:11.847 --> 00:17:12.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:16.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is that truth is not relative;

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:18.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is absolute.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who say truth is relative

00:17:20.989 --> 00:17:24.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not only relatively but absolutely wrong.

00:17:25.561 --> 00:17:28.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Hebrew word for “truth,” <i>ʼ</i><i>emeth</i><i>ʹ</i><i>,</i>

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:31.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
is often rendered “truth”

00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:34.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may designate what is firm,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
trustworthy, stable, or faithful.

00:17:38.707 --> 00:17:42.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word for “truth,”
<i>a·le</i><i>ʹ</i><i>thei·a</i>,

00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:46.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
originates with a word meaning
“not concealed,”

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:49.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the truth often involves the revealing

00:17:49.551 --> 00:17:52.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
of that which was formerly hidden.

00:17:53.288 --> 00:17:58.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said according to Luke 12:2:

00:17:58.761 --> 00:18:03.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But there is nothing carefully concealed
that will not be revealed,

00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:06.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing secret
that will not become known.”

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are over 70 places
in the Gospel accounts

00:18:11.406 --> 00:18:14.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jesus is said
to have used a unique expression

00:18:14.977 --> 00:18:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
to emphasize the truthfulness of his words.

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:21.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would often say “Amen”

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:25.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
to introduce a sentence.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:29.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
The corresponding Hebrew word
meant “certain, true.”

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notes <i>The New International Dictionary</i>
<i>of New Testament Theology:</i>

00:18:35.097 --> 00:18:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By introducing his words with amen

00:18:39.768 --> 00:18:43.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus labelled them as certain and reliable.

00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:46.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He stood by them and made them binding

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
on himself and his hearers.”

00:18:50.612 --> 00:18:55.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The New International Dictionary </i>
<i>of New Testament Theology,</i>

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Volume 3, page 901, says:

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:04.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Many people try] to ‘unmask’ everything,

00:19:04.092 --> 00:19:06.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the belief that no one and nothing

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:10.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“can genuinely lay claim to truth. . . .

00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:13.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Truth can indeed be found . . .

00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:16.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[We need to display]
a humble submission to truth

00:19:16.705 --> 00:19:19.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whenever and wherever it emerges.

00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:22.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Such openness to truth is required

00:19:22.444 --> 00:19:25.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of those who worship the God of truth . . .

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:29.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reverence for truth ensures honesty

00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:31.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a man’s dealings with his neighbour,

00:19:31.653 --> 00:19:34.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“both in word and deed.

00:19:34.656 --> 00:19:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the attitude . . .
to which both the O[ld] T[estament]

00:19:38.327 --> 00:19:43.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the N[ew] T[estament] bear witness.”

00:19:44.733 --> 00:19:47.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the truth ever change?

00:19:47.903 --> 00:19:52.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
That question was raised by V. R. Ruggiero

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his book <i>The Art of Thinking</i>. 

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:58.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
His answer is no.

00:19:58.313 --> 00:20:00.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
To quote him:

00:20:00.315 --> 00:20:03.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It may sometimes seem to [that it changes],

00:20:03.585 --> 00:20:07.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on closer inspection
it will be found not to.”

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the truth never changes!

00:20:12.561 --> 00:20:16.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Consider,” he says,
“the case of the authorship

00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:20.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the first book of the Bible,
the book of Genesis.

00:20:20.335 --> 00:20:23.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For centuries Christians and Jews alike

00:20:23.405 --> 00:20:26.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“believed that the book had a single author.

00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:29.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In time this view was challenged,

00:20:29.444 --> 00:20:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and eventually replaced by the belief

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:36.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that as many as five authors
contributed to Genesis.

00:20:37.853 --> 00:20:39.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then, in 1981,

00:20:39.922 --> 00:20:44.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the results of a 5-year linguistic analysis
of Genesis

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were published,
stating that there is

00:20:47.596 --> 00:20:52.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“an 82 percent probability
of single authorship,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as originally thought.

00:20:55.537 --> 00:20:59.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Has the truth
about the authorship of Genesis changed?

00:20:59.641 --> 00:21:00.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No.

00:21:00.575 --> 00:21:05.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only our belief has changed.”

00:21:06.381 --> 00:21:07.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also wrote:

00:21:07.649 --> 00:21:12.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The truth will not be changed
by our knowledge or by our ignorance.”

00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:16.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we agree.

00:21:16.024 --> 00:21:19.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, no one really believes
that there is no truth.

00:21:19.895 --> 00:21:22.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to physical realities,

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:26.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as medicine, mathematics,
or the laws of physics,

00:21:26.802 --> 00:21:31.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
all people believe that some things are true.

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:33.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us would dare to ride in an airplane

00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:36.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we didn’t believe
that the laws of aerodynamics

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:38.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
were absolute truths?

00:21:39.681 --> 00:21:42.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verifiable truths do exist.

00:21:42.117 --> 00:21:45.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
They surround us,
and we stake our lives on them.

00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:50.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the truth ever change?

00:21:50.993 --> 00:21:53.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not.

00:21:53.128 --> 00:21:56.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our understanding of truth changes

00:21:56.465 --> 00:21:58.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we progress in understanding it,

00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:02.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the truth never changes.

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:08.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus said that our purpose in life
was to talk about the truth,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was speaking of something
that faithful Jews had valued

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
for centuries.

00:22:13.982 --> 00:22:18.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
In their sacred writings,
the Jews had long read of truth

00:22:18.253 --> 00:22:22.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
as something concrete, not theoretical.

00:22:23.225 --> 00:22:28.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible,
“truth” translates the Hebrew word <i>ʼ</i><i>emeth</i><i>ʹ</i><i>,</i>

00:22:28.163 --> 00:22:32.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
which signifies that which is firm, solid

00:22:32.234 --> 00:22:37.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, perhaps most of all, reliable.

00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:42.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews had good reason
for viewing truth in that way.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:47.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
They called their God,
“Jehovah, the God of truth.”

00:22:47.215 --> 00:22:52.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was because everything Jehovah said
he would do, he did.

00:22:52.154 --> 00:22:55.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he made promises, he kept them.

00:22:55.057 --> 00:22:58.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he inspired prophecies,
they were fulfilled.

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:02.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he uttered final judgments,
they were carried out.

00:23:03.932 --> 00:23:08.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Millions of Israelites
had been eyewitnesses of these realities.

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:10.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
The inspired writers of the Bible

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:15.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded them
as indisputable facts of history.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike other books viewed as sacred,

00:23:17.913 --> 00:23:22.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible is not set
against a backdrop of myth or legend.

00:23:23.518 --> 00:23:28.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is firmly grounded in verifiable facts

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:32.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
—historical, archaeological, scientific,

00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:37.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sociological realities.

00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:40.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder the psalmist says to Jehovah:

00:23:40.602 --> 00:23:43.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your law is truth. . . .

00:23:43.405 --> 00:23:46.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All your commandments are truth. . . .

00:23:46.408 --> 00:23:49.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
The very essence of your word is truth”!

00:23:51.546 --> 00:23:54.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jehovah God is the Author of the Bible,

00:23:54.616 --> 00:23:57.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible is truth.

00:23:57.252 --> 00:24:00.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus Christ echoed the words of that psalm

00:24:00.422 --> 00:24:02.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he said in prayer to Jehovah:

00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:06.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your word is truth.”

00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:09.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew that everything his Father spoke

00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:13.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
was absolutely firm and reliable.

00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:18.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise,
Jesus himself was “full of . . . truth.”

00:24:18.206 --> 00:24:22.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, 
Jesus was even the personification of truth.

00:24:24.112 --> 00:24:27.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Mosaic Law was truth.

00:24:27.282 --> 00:24:30.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was not the full truth.

00:24:30.118 --> 00:24:34.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus taught something different
from the Mosaic Law.

00:24:34.322 --> 00:24:36.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible shows that the Mosaic Law

00:24:36.424 --> 00:24:39.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a “shadow,” or prophetic picture,

00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:44.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
of greater realities,
which came true through Christ.

00:24:44.533 --> 00:24:47.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the Mosaic Law was not the full truth

00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:50.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a pattern of it.

00:24:51.506 --> 00:24:55.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was not the shadow but the reality.

00:24:55.644 --> 00:24:58.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said at John 14:6:

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am . . . the truth.”

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as far as teachings are concerned,
what is truth?

00:25:06.555 --> 00:25:08.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helps us to understand it?

00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:14.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible speaks
of “the spirit of the truth.”

00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:16.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is “the spirit of the truth”?

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:20.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the spirit
that proceeds from Jehovah God.

00:25:20.635 --> 00:25:23.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is pure and holy.

00:25:23.171 --> 00:25:28.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus told his disciples at John 16:12, 13:

00:25:29.878 --> 00:25:32.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I still have many things to say to you,

00:25:32.347 --> 00:25:34.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but you are not able to bear them now.

00:25:34.983 --> 00:25:37.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, when that one comes,

00:25:37.152 --> 00:25:39.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the spirit of the truth,

00:25:39.421 --> 00:25:41.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he will guide you into all the truth,

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for he will not speak of his own initiative,

00:25:45.026 --> 00:25:47.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but what he hears he will speak,

00:25:47.596 --> 00:25:49.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will declare to you

00:25:49.598 --> 00:25:51.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
the things to come.”

00:25:52.267 --> 00:25:55.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s spirit would teach them
everything they needed to know

00:25:55.837 --> 00:25:57.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry out their work,

00:25:57.872 --> 00:26:01.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
recalling and opening up their understanding

00:26:01.509 --> 00:26:04.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
to things
they had previously heard from Jesus

00:26:04.746 --> 00:26:07.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had not understood.

00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:12.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s spirit would also declare to them
the things coming,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the bringing to light

00:26:14.222 --> 00:26:18.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
the significance
of Jesus’ death and resurrection,

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:20.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
as these events were then yet future

00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:22.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
and were among the things

00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:25.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his disciples did not understand
in the beginning.

00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:30.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Charles Taze Russell wrote the book

00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:33.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Divine Plan of the Ages</i>.

00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:37.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was published in 1886.

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:39.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
It included a discussion on

00:26:39.514 --> 00:26:42.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Bible as a Divine Revelation

00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:44.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Viewed in the Light of Reason.”

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said:

00:26:47.255 --> 00:26:52.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The depth and power and wisdom
and scope of the Bible’s testimony

00:26:52.093 --> 00:26:56.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
convince us that not man,
but Almighty God, is the author.”

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:02.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
To appreciate the truth more,

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what can we compare the truth?

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a mirror
that helps us to see the facts

00:27:10.512 --> 00:27:13.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, if necessary, to improve our looks.

00:27:14.649 --> 00:27:19.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a pillar
—firm and supportive—

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it helps to combat false teachings.

00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:27.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is also compared
to a girdle, or “belt,”

00:27:27.162 --> 00:27:29.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
that warriors used.

00:27:29.197 --> 00:27:32.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to continue with right conduct.

00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:36.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a rainbow for beauty.

00:27:37.772 --> 00:27:41.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is as beautiful
as the song of the nightingale.

00:27:42.177 --> 00:27:46.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a romantic bonfire for warmth

00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:48.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a cold evening.

00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:52.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is an illustration
that many of you will like:

00:27:52.854 --> 00:27:55.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the first cup of coffee
in the morning,

00:27:55.557 --> 00:27:57.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
invigorating somebody.

00:27:57.392 --> 00:28:00.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, truth is invigorating.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a magnet,

00:28:03.898 --> 00:28:06.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
drawing honest-hearted ones to God.

00:28:07.736 --> 00:28:10.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like an oasis in the desert.

00:28:11.206 --> 00:28:14.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like an anchor in the stormy seas.

00:28:15.643 --> 00:28:18.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a lifeboat on a sinking ship.

00:28:19.848 --> 00:28:22.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a lighthouse in the night,

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
guiding a boat safely to the shore or harbor.

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:31.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a compass
showing sailors the way.

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:33.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is also like a compass

00:28:33.194 --> 00:28:36.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing the way out of a jungle
to a safe area.

00:28:37.932 --> 00:28:42.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the rising sun
bathing the landscape in warm light.

00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:47.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the display of fireworks
for beauty.

00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:53.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the magnetic shield
around the earth,

00:28:53.014 --> 00:28:56.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
protecting it from deathly cosmic radiation.

00:28:58.686 --> 00:29:00.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like light.

00:29:00.688 --> 00:29:05.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fruitage of the light
consists of every sort of . . . truth.”

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
He that “does what is true

00:29:07.595 --> 00:29:10.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes to the light,”
the Bible says.

00:29:10.732 --> 00:29:15.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine you were born blind
and received eyesight through an operation.

00:29:15.703 --> 00:29:18.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you be elated?

00:29:18.273 --> 00:29:23.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like that when somebody
comes to know and appreciate it.

00:29:24.813 --> 00:29:29.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like beautiful music
played solo or by an orchestra.

00:29:30.718 --> 00:29:34.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the most delicious food
for taste and gives strength.

00:29:36.458 --> 00:29:39.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is what a nursing mother is
to her baby.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:45.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a hidden treasure;
we need to dig for it.

00:29:46.801 --> 00:29:49.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like refreshing water on a hot day.

00:29:51.005 --> 00:29:53.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a mighty river.

00:29:53.508 --> 00:29:58.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you try to stop it with a dam,
it will overflow the dam.

00:29:58.346 --> 00:30:01.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody can stop the truth.

00:30:01.716 --> 00:30:03.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:06.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah, the Almighty,
is backing it up.

00:30:07.689 --> 00:30:09.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a flower

00:30:09.691 --> 00:30:13.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even a bouquet
of beautiful little flowers.

00:30:13.094 --> 00:30:15.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Russell once wrote:

00:30:15.096 --> 00:30:18.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Truth, like a modest little flower

00:30:18.833 --> 00:30:20.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the wilderness of life,

00:30:20.835 --> 00:30:23.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is surrounded and <i>almost</i>  choked

00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:27.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the luxuriant growth
of the weeds of error.

00:30:27.141 --> 00:30:30.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you would find it
you must be ever on the lookout.

00:30:30.612 --> 00:30:35.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you would see its beauty
you must brush aside the weeds of error

00:30:35.016 --> 00:30:38.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the brambles of bigotry.

00:30:38.052 --> 00:30:42.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you would possess it
you must stoop to get it.

00:30:42.724 --> 00:30:47.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be not content with <i>one</i>  flower of truth.

00:30:47.629 --> 00:30:52.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Had one been sufficient
there would have been no more.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gather ever, seek for more.”

00:30:56.271 --> 00:30:59.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a fragrance, or perfume.

00:31:00.174 --> 00:31:02.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a sparkling diamond.

00:31:02.844 --> 00:31:05.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you love diamonds?

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the truth’s value
is so much more than diamonds

00:31:08.516 --> 00:31:11.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it brings Jehovah’s friendship

00:31:11.352 --> 00:31:14.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leads to everlasting life.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is compared to a way on which we walk.

00:31:19.193 --> 00:31:23.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 2:2
speaks of “the way of the truth.”

00:31:24.832 --> 00:31:26.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘God is a Spirit,

00:31:26.568 --> 00:31:30.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who worship him
must do so with spirit and truth.’

00:31:32.106 --> 00:31:34.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time to study the truth

00:31:34.342 --> 00:31:39.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
and attend Christian meetings
where the truth is taught.

00:31:39.013 --> 00:31:41.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not miss congregation meetings.

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:45.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Timothy 3:15 compares the congregation

00:31:45.587 --> 00:31:49.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
with “a pillar . . . of the truth.”

00:31:49.357 --> 00:31:52.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation
preserves the purity of the truth

00:31:52.627 --> 00:31:54.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and upholds it.

00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:56.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, Jehovah teaches us through the Bible

00:31:56.764 --> 00:32:00.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also through Christian meetings.

00:32:00.602 --> 00:32:03.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also to speak the truth by preaching.

00:32:03.605 --> 00:32:07.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
We speak the truth also with one another.

00:32:07.108 --> 00:32:09.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the truth on our lips;

00:32:09.477 --> 00:32:12.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the truth around our hips.

00:32:12.914 --> 00:32:15.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 6:14 says

00:32:15.483 --> 00:32:19.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have “the belt of truth
fastened around [our] waist.”

00:32:20.955 --> 00:32:25.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world is in utter confusion.

00:32:26.728 --> 00:32:29.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is to know the truth!

00:32:29.564 --> 00:32:31.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice in it!

00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:35.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are ready to preach the truth
and teach the truth.

00:32:36.738 --> 00:32:40.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we talk the truth,
and we walk in the truth.

00:32:40.908 --> 00:32:43.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 3 John 3, we read:

00:32:43.978 --> 00:32:47.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go on walking in the truth.”

00:32:47.081 --> 00:32:51.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who walk in the truth now
will walk forever.

00:32:51.552 --> 00:32:54.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Micah 4:5 says:

00:32:54.956 --> 00:32:59.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all the peoples will walk,
each in the name of its god,

00:32:59.093 --> 00:33:02.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we will walk
in the name of Jehovah our God

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
forever and ever.”

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:09.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is a long time!

00:33:10.805 --> 00:33:15.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help your students to love the truth
and to live the truth

00:33:15.109 --> 00:33:19.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, if necessary, to be willing
to die for the truth and for Jehovah.

00:33:20.581 --> 00:33:24.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is invincible
and will conquer this wicked world.

00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:27.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all,
including our relatives

00:33:27.488 --> 00:33:29.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our Bible students,

00:33:29.123 --> 00:33:32.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
have the determination to walk in the truth

00:33:32.093 --> 00:33:34.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talk about the truth.

00:33:34.762 --> 00:33:36.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why shall we do this?

00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:41.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we love the truth
and we love the God of truth.

00:33:42.136 --> 00:33:46.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also to live the truth
by our Christian conduct.

00:33:46.207 --> 00:33:49.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, this is the truth!

00:33:49.177 --> 00:33:51.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
His Word is truth.

00:33:51.479 --> 00:33:55.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep talking the truth,
and keep walking in the truth.

00:33:55.183 --> 00:34:00.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you will walk forever
and praise our loving God of truth!

00:34:05.593 --> 00:34:09.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you
for that absorbing presentation, Gerrit.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really appreciated it.

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:13.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this time, let’s listen

00:34:13.601 --> 00:34:17.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Brother Geoffrey Jackson
speaks to us on the theme

00:34:17.472 --> 00:34:20.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Alert, Be Decisive.”

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:27.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are living in the last of the last days.

00:34:28.049 --> 00:34:33.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means soon we are going to face events

00:34:33.054 --> 00:34:36.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will test our integrity as never before.

00:34:37.992 --> 00:34:40.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, now is the time

00:34:40.795 --> 00:34:44.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to be alert and decisive.

00:34:46.134 --> 00:34:49.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a similar situation
to what our brothers

00:34:49.704 --> 00:34:52.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
found themselves in in the first century.

00:34:53.474 --> 00:34:58.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they had some dramatic events
that faced them.

00:34:59.046 --> 00:35:01.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of the events

00:35:01.482 --> 00:35:04.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
that early Christians had to deal with,

00:35:04.685 --> 00:35:09.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how did Jesus prepare them
to face those events?

00:35:09.524 --> 00:35:11.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does it mean for us today?

00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:17.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,
I’d like you to imagine this scene.

00:35:17.298 --> 00:35:22.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll go back in time to Nisan 9, 33 C.E.

00:35:22.303 --> 00:35:24.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what happened on that day?

00:35:24.739 --> 00:35:28.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was mounted on a donkey.

00:35:28.075 --> 00:35:30.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in your mind, can you visualize it?

00:35:30.244 --> 00:35:34.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re with Jesus
as he starts to go down the area

00:35:34.081 --> 00:35:36.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the Mount of Olives in the Kidron Valley,

00:35:36.417 --> 00:35:39.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looking up toward the city of Jerusalem,
what happens?

00:35:39.987 --> 00:35:44.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
The crowds start to gather
—more and more people.

00:35:44.125 --> 00:35:46.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
People start throwing
their garments on the road;

00:35:46.527 --> 00:35:49.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
others cut down branches
and wave them around.

00:35:49.664 --> 00:35:53.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
They call out: “Blessed is the one
who comes in Jehovah’s name!”

00:35:53.668 --> 00:35:56.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
The whole city is in an uproar!

00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:58.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
How exciting that would have been!

00:35:59.807 --> 00:36:04.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, at that exciting moment in his life,

00:36:05.279 --> 00:36:08.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus started sobbing and crying.

00:36:09.984 --> 00:36:11.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:36:11.319 --> 00:36:15.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to the record in Luke chapter 19

00:36:16.757 --> 00:36:18.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke chapter 19

00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:22.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 41 through 44.

00:36:22.897 --> 00:36:25.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here the inspired account tells us

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “when [Jesus] got nearby,

00:36:28.035 --> 00:36:30.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he viewed the city

00:36:30.538 --> 00:36:33.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and wept over it,

00:36:33.474 --> 00:36:38.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“saying: ‘If you, even you,
had discerned on this day

00:36:38.479 --> 00:36:42.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the things having to do with peace

00:36:42.016 --> 00:36:45.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘—but now they have been hidden
from your eyes.

00:36:45.686 --> 00:36:48.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Because the days will come upon you

00:36:48.222 --> 00:36:52.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘when your enemies will build around you
a fortification of pointed stakes

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and will encircle you
and besiege you from every side.

00:36:58.032 --> 00:37:03.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘They will dash you
and your children within you to the ground,

00:37:03.037 --> 00:37:06.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and they will not leave a stone
upon a stone in you,

00:37:06.908 --> 00:37:11.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you did not discern
the time of your being inspected.’”

00:37:13.414 --> 00:37:15.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we see from these verses?

00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:21.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the compassion
Jesus had for those who would be killed

00:37:21.956 --> 00:37:24.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jerusalem was to be destroyed?

00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:27.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he was envisioning the destruction

00:37:27.828 --> 00:37:31.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would occur in the year 70 C.E.

00:37:31.766 --> 00:37:35.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was moved by the emotions of that

00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:38.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so much so that he cried loudly,

00:37:38.873 --> 00:37:40.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
not silently

00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:44.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
(like he did when
he was about to resurrect Lazarus)

00:37:44.078 --> 00:37:46.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
but audibly and loudly.

00:37:46.647 --> 00:37:48.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we learn from this?

00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:52.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for a start, we can see Jehovah’s love

00:37:52.787 --> 00:37:56.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
for people as reflected in Jesus.

00:37:56.357 --> 00:38:00.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was very distraught
thinking about what would happen

00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:02.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that city and its inhabitants.

00:38:02.997 --> 00:38:04.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 44,

00:38:04.999 --> 00:38:09.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was the other thing
that Jesus was distressed about?

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
That that was a time

00:38:12.673 --> 00:38:16.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
of judgment, we might say, or inspection.

00:38:16.777 --> 00:38:21.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, even though Jesus
was thinking ahead to future events,

00:38:21.515 --> 00:38:26.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
he realized that they
were missing the opportunity at that time

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something

00:38:28.222 --> 00:38:31.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
—things that they needed to
do to prepare for the future.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s something else that we learn too.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only do we learn
from the compassion that Jesus displayed

00:38:40.134 --> 00:38:42.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which we should likewise display

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we think about what’s
going to happen to this wicked world)

00:38:46.607 --> 00:38:50.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also if Jesus
had so much emotion and feeling

00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:54.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
about wicked people
who were about to be destroyed,

00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:57.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you think he felt about his followers?

00:38:57.718 --> 00:38:59.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think he wanted to prepare them?

00:38:59.887 --> 00:39:01.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:04.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why we’re not surprised
that two days later

00:39:04.792 --> 00:39:09.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
he took aside his apostles
and gave them some instructions.

00:39:09.196 --> 00:39:11.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn there to the record

00:39:11.198 --> 00:39:15.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Luke 21:20-22.

00:39:17.304 --> 00:39:20.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is recorded as saying:

00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:24.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, when you see Jerusalem
surrounded by encamped armies

00:39:24.545 --> 00:39:28.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now in this case,
he’s referring to 66 C.E.],

00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:32.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then know that the desolating
of her has drawn near.

00:39:32.887 --> 00:39:37.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then let those in Judea
begin fleeing to the mountains,

00:39:37.892 --> 00:39:40.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let those in the midst of her

00:39:40.194 --> 00:39:43.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, in the midst of Jerusalem] leave,

00:39:43.664 --> 00:39:45.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let those in the countryside

00:39:45.933 --> 00:39:50.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not enter into her
[or, enter into Jerusalem],

00:39:50.604 --> 00:39:54.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because these are days
for meting out justice

00:39:54.175 --> 00:39:58.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order that all the things
written may be fulfilled.”

00:40:00.147 --> 00:40:05.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that there were three groups
of his followers that he was referring to?

00:40:05.052 --> 00:40:08.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spoke about those who lived “in Judea,”

00:40:08.055 --> 00:40:11.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that wasn’t just Jerusalem;
that was the surrounding area.

00:40:11.525 --> 00:40:14.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they were told: ‘Get out of there.

00:40:14.028 --> 00:40:16.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Flee; go to the mountains.’

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he spoke to those
who would be living in Jerusalem.

00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:21.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what did he say?

00:40:21.702 --> 00:40:23.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Leave the city.’

00:40:23.904 --> 00:40:27.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the third group,
those who would live “in the countryside”

00:40:27.208 --> 00:40:29.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we know many people were farmers,

00:40:29.743 --> 00:40:34.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they lived in open areas,
doing agriculture.

00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:36.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Normally, what would be expected

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that if armies
were to come to a certain area,

00:40:39.987 --> 00:40:43.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
these people would flee
into the fortified city.

00:40:43.791 --> 00:40:47.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what Jesus told them
to do was the opposite.

00:40:48.996 --> 00:40:52.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no matter where his followers would be,

00:40:52.266 --> 00:40:56.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether in the countryside,
in the city, or in the general area,

00:40:56.637 --> 00:40:59.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was the common denominator?

00:41:00.441 --> 00:41:03.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t flee to the city.

00:41:03.978 --> 00:41:07.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t put your trust in Jerusalem.

00:41:08.415 --> 00:41:13.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jesus was telling them
what they needed to know

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the events would occur.

00:41:16.824 --> 00:41:20.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what really was the lesson

00:41:20.294 --> 00:41:24.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus was impressing on these ones?

00:41:24.131 --> 00:41:28.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, although those
he was speaking to at that time were Jewish,

00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:32.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had to realize that Jerusalem

00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:36.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
was no longer the earthly seat
of Jehovah’s Kingdom.

00:41:36.544 --> 00:41:39.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to also realize that the temple

00:41:39.446 --> 00:41:43.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
was no longer
the center of Jehovah’s worship.

00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:49.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Christians had to get those facts
clearly in mind

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:52.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make their decisions at that time,

00:41:52.193 --> 00:41:56.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
prior to the events that would come later.

00:41:56.664 --> 00:42:00.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe we could illustrate
in the modern sense.

00:42:00.301 --> 00:42:05.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us have had to face the issue
with regard to blood transfusions.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
When do you need to make your decision
with regard to that?

00:42:10.678 --> 00:42:15.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it when you’re in the ambulance,
semiconscious, in pain?

00:42:15.282 --> 00:42:18.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it, “Oh, give me the DPA;

00:42:20.087 --> 00:42:22.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you read the fine print”?

00:42:23.057 --> 00:42:27.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it when you get
into the emergency operating room

00:42:27.228 --> 00:42:30.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you start arguing with people
and asking questions?

00:42:30.698 --> 00:42:32.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:42:32.366 --> 00:42:35.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
We realize that now is the time

00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:39.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to make our decisions.

00:42:39.206 --> 00:42:42.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we need to live by those decisions.

00:42:42.376 --> 00:42:46.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then if an emergency should occur,

00:42:46.247 --> 00:42:49.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be ready for that situation.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the lesson Jesus was teaching them.

00:42:53.187 --> 00:42:56.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the Christians back in the first century

00:42:56.423 --> 00:43:01.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to rid themselves
of any feelings of nationalistic pride,

00:43:01.028 --> 00:43:04.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
any feelings that Jerusalem was the city.

00:43:04.598 --> 00:43:08.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Otherwise, they would make
the wrong decision.

00:43:08.135 --> 00:43:10.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was especially true

00:43:10.904 --> 00:43:13.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the year 66 C.E.

00:43:14.942 --> 00:43:17.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened in that year?

00:43:17.177 --> 00:43:20.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s consider a brief overview.

00:43:22.383 --> 00:43:24.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us are familiar with what happened

00:43:24.752 --> 00:43:27.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the end of 66 C.E.

00:43:27.488 --> 00:43:29.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, the Roman army,

00:43:29.757 --> 00:43:31.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the leadership of Cestius Gallus,

00:43:31.992 --> 00:43:33.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
attacked Jerusalem.

00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:38.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
But unexpectedly, they retreated,

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowing time for Christians in the city

00:43:42.469 --> 00:43:44.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
to flee Jerusalem.

00:43:45.406 --> 00:43:47.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was that the only thing that happened

00:43:47.775 --> 00:43:49.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the year 66 C.E.?

00:43:51.078 --> 00:43:52.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:43:52.813 --> 00:43:54.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look back in time

00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:57.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see what other events took place.

00:43:57.584 --> 00:44:00.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help us understand why Christians

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to be alert and decisive beforehand.

00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:08.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s think about the background.

00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:10.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jewish nation was fed up

00:44:10.898 --> 00:44:12.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Roman taxation and corruption

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
way back in Jesus’ day.

00:44:15.803 --> 00:44:18.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by the beginning of 66 C.E.,

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:22.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
the situation was even worse.

00:44:22.042 --> 00:44:25.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Roman governor of Judea, Gessius Florus,

00:44:25.612 --> 00:44:27.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
was totally corrupt

00:44:27.681 --> 00:44:31.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was notorious for his cruelty.

00:44:31.018 --> 00:44:34.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spirit of rebellion was everywhere.

00:44:34.655 --> 00:44:38.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judea was a powder keg ready to explode.

00:44:39.993 --> 00:44:43.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the spring of 66 C.E.,

00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:46.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Florus plundered the temple treasury in Jerusalem,

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
stealing some 17 talents.

00:44:49.169 --> 00:44:51.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
This caused a revolt among the Jews.

00:44:52.506 --> 00:44:55.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
In retaliation, Florus ordered his soldiers

00:44:55.876 --> 00:44:58.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attack the rebels and allowed his soldiers

00:44:58.712 --> 00:45:00.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
to plunder hundreds of homes

00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:04.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to kill some 3,600 Jews.

00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:09.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the Roman assault was repelled,

00:45:09.089 --> 00:45:12.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Florus and his men retreated from the city.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:18.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were there at that time,

00:45:18.699 --> 00:45:20.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
how would you have reacted?

00:45:22.202 --> 00:45:25.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you have been outraged by Florus’ action?

00:45:27.908 --> 00:45:30.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you lived in the countryside,

00:45:30.377 --> 00:45:32.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you think the Romans may return

00:45:32.913 --> 00:45:35.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now was the time to flee to Jerusalem?

00:45:37.418 --> 00:45:40.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians needed to be alert and decisive.

00:45:40.788 --> 00:45:42.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,

00:45:42.189 --> 00:45:45.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was not important to Christians.

00:45:45.225 --> 00:45:47.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not the place of safety.

00:45:49.129 --> 00:45:51.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened next?

00:45:51.231 --> 00:45:54.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eleazar, the son of High Priest Ananias,

00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:57.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
gained control of the temple area.

00:45:57.504 --> 00:46:00.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
He suspended the sacrifices offered to the emperor

00:46:02.042 --> 00:46:04.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then drove the remaining Romans

00:46:04.445 --> 00:46:06.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of the upper part of the city.

00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:10.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were there,

00:46:10.584 --> 00:46:12.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you have been proud,

00:46:12.653 --> 00:46:14.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
happy that the corrupt Romans

00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:16.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
were forced to leave?

00:46:16.857 --> 00:46:18.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, though,

00:46:18.525 --> 00:46:21.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was not important to Christians.

00:46:21.762 --> 00:46:23.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not the place of safety.

00:46:24.932 --> 00:46:27.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians needed to be alert

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:30.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decisive and not distracted.

00:46:31.805 --> 00:46:34.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then around July/August,

00:46:34.074 --> 00:46:37.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Menahem, the leader of another Jewish faction,

00:46:37.778 --> 00:46:40.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
overran the Roman fortress of Masada

00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:43.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seized Roman weapons from there.

00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:48.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
He then returned to Jerusalem

00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:52.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and captured the Tower, or Fortress, of Antonia.

00:46:53.126 --> 00:46:55.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
They set fire to Herod’s palace,

00:46:55.395 --> 00:46:58.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
the palaces of Agrippa and Bernice,

00:46:58.298 --> 00:47:01.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as High Priest Ananias’ home.

00:47:02.402 --> 00:47:04.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they ordered the murder

00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:08.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
of High Priest Ananias and his brother Hezekiah.

00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:09.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following that,

00:47:09.776 --> 00:47:12.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
they returned to the Fortress of Antonia

00:47:12.212 --> 00:47:14.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and massacred the garrison

00:47:14.214 --> 00:47:16.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Roman soldiers still there.

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:20.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
The city was divided and in an uproar,

00:47:20.287 --> 00:47:22.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
so Menahem and his men

00:47:22.289 --> 00:47:24.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
escaped back to Masada.

00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:28.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see how easy it would have been

00:47:28.128 --> 00:47:30.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
to join sides with one of the factions?

00:47:32.065 --> 00:47:34.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, though, these events

00:47:34.701 --> 00:47:37.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
were not important to Christians.

00:47:37.638 --> 00:47:40.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
They needed to be alert and decisive

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not distracted.

00:47:43.043 --> 00:47:45.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, around November,

00:47:45.045 --> 00:47:47.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cestius Gallus, the governor of Syria,

00:47:47.748 --> 00:47:49.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
marched with his troops

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
encamped about six miles from Jerusalem.

00:47:53.787 --> 00:47:56.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though it was a Sabbath day,

00:47:56.156 --> 00:47:58.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jewish rebels streamed out of the city

00:47:58.892 --> 00:48:01.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made a hasty assault on the Romans.

00:48:02.429 --> 00:48:04.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Romans retreated to Beth-horon,

00:48:04.431 --> 00:48:06.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Jews captured

00:48:06.033 --> 00:48:08.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Roman supplies and weapons.

00:48:08.869 --> 00:48:11.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Agrippa sent two representatives,

00:48:11.772 --> 00:48:13.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
his personal friends,

00:48:13.373 --> 00:48:14.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Jewish rebels

00:48:14.975 --> 00:48:17.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to persuade them to lay down their weapons

00:48:17.511 --> 00:48:20.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to promise them clemency.

00:48:20.347 --> 00:48:22.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the rebels killed one of the men

00:48:22.716 --> 00:48:24.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wounded the other.

00:48:26.553 --> 00:48:29.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cestius pursued the rebels to Jerusalem,

00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:34.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
camped at Mount Scopus for three days,

00:48:34.695 --> 00:48:37.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then started to undermine the city wall

00:48:37.464 --> 00:48:40.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tried to set fire to the gate of the temple.

00:48:41.568 --> 00:48:45.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then, for some unexpected reason,

00:48:45.772 --> 00:48:48.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gallus and his army retreated.

00:48:48.875 --> 00:48:51.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alert Christians in Jerusalem and Judea

00:48:51.612 --> 00:48:54.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
immediately acted decisively and fled.

00:48:55.916 --> 00:48:58.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rebels chased the Roman army,

00:48:58.185 --> 00:49:00.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
inflicting considerable losses

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
in both men and supplies,

00:49:02.823 --> 00:49:05.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Gallus ordered his soldiers to retreat.

00:49:06.426 --> 00:49:08.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
After seven days,

00:49:08.428 --> 00:49:11.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jewish rebels gave up chasing the Romans

00:49:11.431 --> 00:49:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pillaged the supplies left behind.

00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:18.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
They returned to Jerusalem after eight days.

00:49:20.107 --> 00:49:23.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the situation in Jerusalem at that time?

00:49:24.311 --> 00:49:26.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Josephus says:

00:49:26.313 --> 00:49:28.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In [the] face of the exhilaration

00:49:28.448 --> 00:49:30.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which now seized Jerusalem

00:49:30.651 --> 00:49:33.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the spokesmen for peace [with Rome]

00:49:33.253 --> 00:49:36.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were obliged to remain silent. . . .

00:49:36.523 --> 00:49:38.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even those opposed to the war

00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:40.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were swept along by the force

00:49:40.527 --> 00:49:42.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the circumstances.”

00:49:43.096 --> 00:49:45.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who supported Rome left.

00:49:46.633 --> 00:49:47.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All the rest

00:49:47.668 --> 00:49:50.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were won over to the side of the rebels,

00:49:50.037 --> 00:49:53.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
partly by force, partly by persuasion.”

00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:57.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were there,

00:49:57.377 --> 00:49:58.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
what would you have done?

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many Jews started to flee to Jerusalem,

00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:06.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeking refuge there.

00:50:06.053 --> 00:50:08.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was it a safe refuge?

00:50:08.188 --> 00:50:10.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:50:10.057 --> 00:50:12.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was anarchy in the city.

00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:16.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several Jewish political factions fought each other.

00:50:16.063 --> 00:50:18.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, in 70 C.E.,

00:50:18.532 --> 00:50:22.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was destroyed along with its temple.

00:50:22.035 --> 00:50:24.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Christians who were alert

00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:26.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decisive were safe,

00:50:26.707 --> 00:50:28.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
far away in Pella,

00:50:28.709 --> 00:50:31.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the other side of the Jordan River.

00:50:32.579 --> 00:50:34.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we learn from this brief review

00:50:34.748 --> 00:50:37.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the events of 66 C.E.?

00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:42.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t just one event
—was it?—

00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:45.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a series of events.

00:50:45.325 --> 00:50:47.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were you amazed at how many events

00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:49.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
occurred in 66 C.E.?

00:50:49.696 --> 00:50:51.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was just a brief summary.

00:50:53.433 --> 00:50:55.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were many divisive political

00:50:55.736 --> 00:50:57.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
and religious issues

00:50:57.370 --> 00:51:00.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could have been 
distracting to Christians.

00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:03.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
So those Christians

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to remain focused on their hope.

00:51:06.713 --> 00:51:08.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
They needed to remember

00:51:08.715 --> 00:51:10.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jerusalem and its temple

00:51:10.517 --> 00:51:12.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave no security for them.

00:51:14.554 --> 00:51:16.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should we be so interested

00:51:16.757 --> 00:51:19.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of this today?

00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:21.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what else Jesus said,

00:51:21.428 --> 00:51:24.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Luke chapter 21,

00:51:24.131 --> 00:51:26.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 34 through 36:

00:51:28.668 --> 00:51:31.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pay attention to yourselves

00:51:31.004 --> 00:51:33.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that your hearts never become weighed down

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with overeating and heavy drinking

00:51:36.343 --> 00:51:38.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and anxieties of life,

00:51:38.078 --> 00:51:39.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and suddenly that day

00:51:39.813 --> 00:51:42.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it will come upon all those

00:51:45.719 --> 00:51:49.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“dwelling on the face of the whole earth.

00:51:49.122 --> 00:51:50.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep awake, then,

00:51:50.791 --> 00:51:53.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all the time making supplication

00:51:53.193 --> 00:51:55.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you may succeed in escaping

00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:57.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all these things that must occur

00:51:57.831 --> 00:52:00.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in standing before the Son of man.”

00:52:03.837 --> 00:52:06.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that these things would occur

00:52:06.072 --> 00:52:09.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the face of the whole earth.”

00:52:10.243 --> 00:52:14.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means he wasn’t just talking
about Christians in the first century;

00:52:14.948 --> 00:52:17.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was talking about us today.

00:52:19.319 --> 00:52:23.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we need to pay attention and be alert.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also reminded us to make supplication,

00:52:26.993 --> 00:52:30.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, to strengthen
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:36.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this mean for us today?

00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:40.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we face the great tribulation,
brothers and sisters,

00:52:40.907 --> 00:52:45.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t know exactly
all the details of what will happen,

00:52:45.679 --> 00:52:49.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do know that Jesus did not mean

00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:51.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would have to flee
from one literal city

00:52:51.852 --> 00:52:54.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
or go to a certain mountain range.

00:52:54.187 --> 00:52:55.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could we?

00:52:55.856 --> 00:52:59.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re scattered
over the whole face of the earth.

00:52:59.159 --> 00:53:02.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do need to remember the same things

00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:05.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the first-century Christians
needed to remember.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t put our trust

00:53:08.935 --> 00:53:13.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the religious
and political systems of Satan’s world.

00:53:13.673 --> 00:53:16.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is this so vital?

00:53:16.243 --> 00:53:18.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as in 66 C.E.,

00:53:18.812 --> 00:53:21.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
today we see one event after another

00:53:21.748 --> 00:53:24.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading up to the final day.

00:53:24.651 --> 00:53:26.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everywhere there is evidence

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
of political instability and infighting

00:53:30.357 --> 00:53:34.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only among nations
but also within nations.

00:53:35.262 --> 00:53:38.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Religious, political, and social issues

00:53:38.598 --> 00:53:41.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
—including abortion and homosexuality—

00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:44.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
have become divisive topics.

00:53:44.404 --> 00:53:47.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Scientific issues, such as global warming,

00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:50.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
have also become political issues.

00:53:52.679 --> 00:53:54.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as in the first century,

00:53:54.848 --> 00:53:57.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must take to heart Jesus’ warning:

00:53:57.918 --> 00:54:00.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t take sides in the chaos

00:54:00.387 --> 00:54:02.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s happening all around us.

00:54:02.422 --> 00:54:06.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, keep your focus on the Kingdom hope.

00:54:12.232 --> 00:54:16.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, soon we will face events

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:21.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will test our integrity as never before.

00:54:21.574 --> 00:54:23.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are the takeaway points?

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all, we realize

00:54:25.845 --> 00:54:28.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
that now is the time we need
to make decisions

00:54:28.882 --> 00:54:31.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stick to those decisions.

00:54:31.451 --> 00:54:34.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we need to be absolutely determined

00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:38.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to put our faith
and trust in worldly politics.

00:54:38.658 --> 00:54:43.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to remain neutral,
always thinking of God’s Kingdom.

00:54:43.663 --> 00:54:48.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also need to remember that it’s
not just one event coming up in the future.

00:54:48.468 --> 00:54:50.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be a series of events

00:54:50.103 --> 00:54:53.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
all happening at the same time
that could be distracting.

00:54:53.673 --> 00:54:56.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we have made up our decision now,

00:54:56.643 --> 00:54:58.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be ready for that time.

00:54:58.645 --> 00:55:01.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also we remember the need to keep

00:55:01.481 --> 00:55:04.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
our relationship strong with Jehovah God.

00:55:04.017 --> 00:55:07.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we remember the compassion of Jesus.

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah and Jesus want us

00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:11.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be protected at that time.

00:55:11.958 --> 00:55:14.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may we be determined

00:55:14.594 --> 00:55:19.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue to be alert and decisive!

00:55:28.341 --> 00:55:30.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was really interesting, wasn’t it?

00:55:30.343 --> 00:55:34.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of work went into that video,
and I’m sure glad we saw it.

00:55:34.748 --> 00:55:37.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly brought everything home to us.

00:55:38.151 --> 00:55:42.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the brothers in Ukraine
have been in our prayers.

00:55:42.622 --> 00:55:46.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we know,
many fled the country because of the war.

00:55:46.659 --> 00:55:50.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them, when they fled
just had the clothes on their back

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:52.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just a little bit more than that.

00:55:52.665 --> 00:55:54.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question is,

00:55:54.367 --> 00:55:59.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
How were they cared for in their new country?

00:55:59.105 --> 00:56:02.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this next video, just a short one,

00:56:02.042 --> 00:56:04.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to tell us about the love

00:56:04.144 --> 00:56:07.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was shown to our brothers
in neighboring countries

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the tremendous amount of work
that was involved

00:56:10.984 --> 00:56:13.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
in caring for these refugees.

00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:19.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
We thought that this might be

00:56:19.092 --> 00:56:23.596 line:10% position:50% align:center
some kind of pushing between the empires,

00:56:23.596 --> 00:56:27.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
but something else happened
—the worst-case scenario.

00:56:27.067 --> 00:56:29.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were aware of the fact
that we had to prepare

00:56:29.636 --> 00:56:31.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some serious changes.

00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:36.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were thousands of people
at the border.

00:56:36.209 --> 00:56:40.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
People had to wait in long queues
several kilometers long.

00:56:41.114 --> 00:56:42.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost every day,

00:56:42.949 --> 00:56:45.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
we received 200 or more refugees

00:56:45.852 --> 00:56:49.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our brothers and sisters
who were seeking refuge in Poland.

00:56:52.192 --> 00:56:55.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was really touching,
since most of them had only one bag.

00:56:55.862 --> 00:56:58.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not possible to take more.

00:57:01.134 --> 00:57:03.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers of the Coordinators’ Committee

00:57:03.136 --> 00:57:04.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body

00:57:04.704 --> 00:57:06.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
were analyzing with us

00:57:06.239 --> 00:57:09.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how to help and what we could do.

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:12.345 line:10% position:50% align:center
Immediately

00:57:12.345 --> 00:57:14.147 line:10% position:50% align:center
the first Disaster Relief Committee

00:57:14.147 --> 00:57:15.482 line:10% position:50% align:center
was set up,

00:57:15.982 --> 00:57:18.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we realized that there was

00:57:18.151 --> 00:57:20.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
already a need in the whole of Poland,

00:57:21.421 --> 00:57:24.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
16 committees started their work.

00:57:25.425 --> 00:57:28.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
The number of DC-50 applications,

00:57:29.195 --> 00:57:30.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who wanted to volunteer,

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:34.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
increased every week by thousands,

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicating that the willingness
and readiness to help was huge.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prepared everything in order to be able

00:57:42.942 --> 00:57:45.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
to welcome the refugees
at the border crossings,

00:57:45.712 --> 00:57:49.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the reception points set up
by the authorities on the Ukrainian border,

00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:51.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at other locations

00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:53.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the trains from Ukraine were arriving.

00:57:54.354 --> 00:57:59.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
We knew we would have to ask
the congregations for accommodations.

00:57:59.993 --> 00:58:01.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the beginning,

00:58:01.628 --> 00:58:05.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
we prepared a survey
that helped us to organize everything.

00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:10.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that it’s thanks to Jehovah’s backing

00:58:10.203 --> 00:58:12.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in just a few days,

00:58:12.472 --> 00:58:16.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
we received more than 7,500 replies.

00:58:18.044 --> 00:58:21.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Four Assembly Halls and 22 Kingdom Halls

00:58:21.447 --> 00:58:25.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
were temporarily converted
to refugee relief centers.

00:58:28.588 --> 00:58:32.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers were traveling for days
and needed some basic things

00:58:32.725 --> 00:58:37.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hygienic products, diapers for children,
and many other things—

00:58:38.298 --> 00:58:41.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only clothes but many basic necessities.

00:58:41.534 --> 00:58:44.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
They received food;
they could warm up,

00:58:44.037 --> 00:58:46.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
take a shower,
and get some rest.

00:58:48.107 --> 00:58:51.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to this, in many places,

00:58:51.444 --> 00:58:54.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
volunteers prepared rooms
for donated garments

00:58:54.647 --> 00:58:57.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
where brothers and sisters
could choose clothing.

00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:01.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some places, brothers prepared

00:59:01.254 --> 00:59:03.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
special areas for children

00:59:03.957 --> 00:59:06.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there were toys, crayons,

00:59:07.493 --> 00:59:09.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
something to draw on, something to play with

00:59:10.163 --> 00:59:12.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the children could feel busy there.

00:59:13.766 --> 00:59:16.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing something helped them

00:59:16.002 --> 00:59:19.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get their minds off what they saw
when they were fleeing.

00:59:21.174 --> 00:59:25.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
The children expressed their gratitude
in their pictures.

00:59:25.511 --> 00:59:29.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost everywhere they wrote: <i>“Dzi</i><i>ękuję.”</i>

00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:32.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Spasiba.”</i>  (Thank you.)

00:59:32.518 --> 00:59:34.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
They drew pictures of Paradise,

00:59:34.687 --> 00:59:36.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressions of their hope.

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:39.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so touching.

00:59:40.793 --> 00:59:42.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
The circuit overseers

00:59:42.328 --> 00:59:43.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
together with the elders

00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:46.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
did something absolutely spectacular.

00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:49.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the beginning,
some of these brothers

00:59:49.736 --> 00:59:53.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
made hundreds of shepherding calls
in two or three weeks.

00:59:58.344 --> 01:00:00.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
The goal was to deliver

01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:03.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
40,000 humanitarian aid boxes.

01:00:03.149 --> 01:00:05.818 line:10% position:50% align:center
We were responsible for purchasing food,

01:00:05.818 --> 01:00:08.688 line:10% position:50% align:center
hygiene products, first-aid items,

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:09.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
medical supplies.

01:00:10.757 --> 01:00:14.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to find a logistical location
where we could store all of this.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Afterward,
we had to think about how to pack it,

01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:21.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to deliver it to the border,

01:00:21.668 --> 01:00:23.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then how to transport it to Ukraine,

01:00:24.437 --> 01:00:27.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
where at this very moment the war continued.

01:00:27.573 --> 01:00:30.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very nice to observe the volunteers

01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:32.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
who came to help us pack up the supplies.

01:00:32.945 --> 01:00:36.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the brothers from all over the country
got to know about the need,

01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:37.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were ready to drive

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:41.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
300 or more kilometers (185 miles)
for many hours

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
to devote a couple of hours to packing boxes.

01:00:45.758 --> 01:00:47.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it turned out later on,

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was more or less 190 tons of supplies.

01:00:51.798 --> 01:00:53.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each package,

01:00:53.266 --> 01:00:55.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also put some drawings made by children.

01:00:55.935 --> 01:00:59.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was an expression of love
in those humanitarian aid boxes.

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:06.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having this opportunity to help the brothers,

01:01:06.612 --> 01:01:10.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw an expression of Jehovah’s love

01:01:10.149 --> 01:01:12.151 line:10% position:50% align:center
and might in all these efforts.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.756 line:10% position:50% align:center
Only Jehovah could prepare his people

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:20.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
for such a well-organized
and effective activity.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
Many of the brothers have commented

01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:25.231 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the fact that they see

01:01:25.231 --> 01:01:27.166 line:10% position:50% align:center
so much being done to help the brothers

01:01:27.166 --> 01:01:28.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Ukraine right now

01:01:28.901 --> 01:01:32.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
convinces them that if they are
in that situation in the future,

01:01:32.405 --> 01:01:36.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
if there is some time when they need
that love or they need the help,

01:01:36.075 --> 01:01:40.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, Jehovah’s organization
is going to be there to help them as well.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Belonging to Jehovah’s household

01:01:44.083 --> 01:01:46.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being part of a worldwide family

01:01:46.586 --> 01:01:48.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
is priceless.

01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:53.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hatred in the world
continues to grow constantly,

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:57.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s just more conflict and disunity.

01:01:57.597 --> 01:01:58.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,

01:01:58.931 --> 01:02:02.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unity and the love of Jehovah’s people

01:02:02.935 --> 01:02:04.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
just keeps on increasing,

01:02:04.937 --> 01:02:07.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it just becomes more and more powerful.

01:02:12.779 --> 01:02:16.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to thank
all those who had a share

01:02:16.783 --> 01:02:20.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
in providing that humanitarian assistance.

01:02:20.353 --> 01:02:24.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of work, a lot of thought,
a lot of planning went into that,

01:02:24.791 --> 01:02:28.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it certainly is appreciated.

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:32.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, how did the brothers from Ukraine

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:36.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
get to these neighboring countries?

01:02:36.035 --> 01:02:40.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they had
some pretty hair-raising experiences.

01:02:40.072 --> 01:02:44.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the next video is going
to recount some of their experiences.

01:02:44.744 --> 01:02:47.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you may need
to have a hankie handy.

01:03:11.604 --> 01:03:13.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought it might be a truck driving by.

01:03:14.774 --> 01:03:17.109 line:10% position:50% align:center
When it happened again, we got up 

01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:19.445 line:10% position:50% align:center
and started reading the news on the Internet,

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:24.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we found out that there were explosions
happening in all the cities.

01:03:26.752 --> 01:03:28.754 line:10% position:50% align:center
My mom awoke from her sleep

01:03:28.754 --> 01:03:31.357 line:10% position:50% align:center
to sirens sounding all over the city.

01:03:31.357 --> 01:03:33.893 line:10% position:50% align:center
Of course, we were very anxious

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:36.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and turned on the TV immediately,

01:03:36.429 --> 01:03:39.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we didn’t even have
to look for information

01:03:39.298 --> 01:03:43.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all the channels were already talking
about the fact that war had started.

01:03:44.303 --> 01:03:47.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just immediately
started praying to Jehovah,

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
calling friends and close ones
and asking how they were,

01:03:51.344 --> 01:03:53.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and waiting for guidance from the brothers.

01:03:55.648 --> 01:03:57.517 line:10% position:50% align:center
At 5:30 a.m.,

01:03:57.517 --> 01:03:59.719 line:10% position:50% align:center
a brother from Kyiv called us

01:03:59.719 --> 01:04:02.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
and said that the bombs were landing in Kyiv.

01:04:05.057 --> 01:04:09.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
We immediately got up, woke up the children,

01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:11.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and told them about the situation.

01:04:11.898 --> 01:04:14.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we didn’t let the children go to school.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
We realized that our lives had changed.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.809 line:10% position:50% align:center
We read the daily text, but I want to note

01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:26.412 line:10% position:50% align:center
that this scripture is well-known for us.

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:28.981 line:10% position:50% align:center
It used to be a yeartext

01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:30.783 line:10% position:50% align:center
and, of course, we knew it.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.886 line:10% position:50% align:center
But at that moment, it sounded special.

01:04:33.886 --> 01:04:36.322 line:10% position:50% align:center
I mean, it was like personal guidance,

01:04:36.322 --> 01:04:37.857 line:10% position:50% align:center
such a personal answer

01:04:37.857 --> 01:04:40.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah to everyone.

01:04:40.092 --> 01:04:42.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I understood what I had to do.

01:04:43.763 --> 01:04:47.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that day,
brothers created a Zoom meeting

01:04:47.366 --> 01:04:49.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ran for the whole day.

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:53.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
And brothers and sisters
could connect via Zoom to preach,

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:57.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk to each other, and support each other.

01:04:57.043 --> 01:04:59.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were all together.

01:05:00.246 --> 01:05:03.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day it became more difficult.

01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:06.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
It became more difficult to deliver food,

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:09.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the food became more expensive.

01:05:10.856 --> 01:05:12.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
People started to panic,

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:19.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
which led to panic buying of medicines

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
and basic staple products.

01:05:23.869 --> 01:05:26.806 line:10% position:50% align:center
Yes, before that, during the pandemic,

01:05:26.806 --> 01:05:28.507 line:10% position:50% align:center
for two years now,

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:30.576 line:10% position:50% align:center
brothers had been constantly reminding us

01:05:30.576 --> 01:05:32.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the necessity of go bags.

01:05:33.813 --> 01:05:36.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, closer to the war,

01:05:36.048 --> 01:05:38.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminders also began to come from brothers

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
about not only stocking up on such backpacks

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:44.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also about checking
what condition they were in.

01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:49.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was also recommended to stock up
on food for two months in advance.

01:05:52.131 --> 01:05:56.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the war started,
we were really frightened

01:05:56.002 --> 01:05:59.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was
in my ninth month of pregnancy,

01:05:59.572 --> 01:06:01.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I could go into labor at any moment.

01:06:02.074 --> 01:06:04.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prayed a lot.

01:06:04.076 --> 01:06:06.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wanted to work out what to do next,

01:06:06.445 --> 01:06:08.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the right thing for us to do was.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:13.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
We weren’t sure
what was going on or how it would end.

01:06:13.452 --> 01:06:17.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we heard that next to us
they bombed a hospital

01:06:17.523 --> 01:06:21.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they bombed a dormitory, we understood 

01:06:21.861 --> 01:06:24.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to find a safer place.

01:06:26.432 --> 01:06:29.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was then that my husband
made the decision that we should go.

01:06:31.037 --> 01:06:34.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
We couldn’t leave
because I wasn’t able to travel.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even to transport me
from one room to the other was a problem.

01:06:40.112 --> 01:06:44.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the situation
really was such that in our case

01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:47.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was very difficult to leave.

01:06:47.219 --> 01:06:49.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was very hard to stay

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:53.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
because almost every day
the area was being shelled.

01:06:55.995 --> 01:06:57.163 line:10% position:50% align:center
My dad is

01:06:57.163 --> 01:06:59.565 line:10% position:50% align:center
in quite a difficult condition right now.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is completely blind with poor hearing;

01:07:03.869 --> 01:07:08.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had a stroke
and broke his hip a few months ago.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now he is completely bedridden

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:15.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and requires constant care.

01:07:15.748 --> 01:07:18.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Katya’s mom is hard of hearing,

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:20.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she broke her arm.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:25.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our duty to take care of our parents.

01:07:25.091 --> 01:07:28.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is a commandment that Jehovah gave,

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:32.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we did not know
how we could do it in this situation.

01:07:33.866 --> 01:07:37.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the war started,
in the first days of it,

01:07:37.603 --> 01:07:40.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
my grandfather had a second stroke,

01:07:41.707 --> 01:07:45.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worries about him
were added to the situation.

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:50.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to take care of him
because he could not eat.

01:07:51.117 --> 01:07:55.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only my mom, my older brother,
my grandmother, and I

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
are Jehovah’s Witnesses in our family.

01:07:58.891 --> 01:08:01.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad was worried about my safety.

01:08:01.694 --> 01:08:06.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understood that out of our whole family,
I was the only one who could leave.

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:13.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we left, my husband
called an elder from our congregation.

01:08:14.206 --> 01:08:17.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and his wife were already
in the west of Ukraine at the time,

01:08:17.409 --> 01:08:19.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they gave us a lot of advice.

01:08:20.813 --> 01:08:23.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
They gave us advice
on how to behave at roadblocks,

01:08:23.883 --> 01:08:27.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should hide our phones
and not take photos of anything.

01:08:28.287 --> 01:08:31.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were advising us
on which villages to go through

01:08:31.157 --> 01:08:33.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there were
very big traffic jams at the time

01:08:33.826 --> 01:08:37.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and people were stopped in some traffic jams
for 10 to 12 hours.

01:08:39.565 --> 01:08:41.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were no lights.

01:08:41.734 --> 01:08:45.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
We drove large sections
of the road in one go,

01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:48.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
constantly praying
that we wouldn’t get a flat tire,

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the car wouldn’t break down,

01:08:50.676 --> 01:08:52.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we wouldn’t get stuck in a field.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before each checkpoint, we were so nervous

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
because local militia
when drunk could be unpredictable,

01:09:06.258 --> 01:09:10.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since they had weapons
—combat weapons—

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:14.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were afraid not only of the invaders

01:09:15.935 --> 01:09:17.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
but of the locals as well.

01:09:18.838 --> 01:09:22.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think we ever prayed
as much as we did

01:09:22.107 --> 01:09:24.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
during those hours on the road.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:27.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
My husband tried to stay as calm as possible

01:09:29.248 --> 01:09:31.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reassure me so that I wouldn’t worry.

01:09:35.321 --> 01:09:38.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister found out
that there would be an evacuation train,

01:09:40.025 --> 01:09:42.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we kind of wanted to get on it;

01:09:43.062 --> 01:09:45.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we were not sure that we would.

01:09:45.965 --> 01:09:48.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this time, with prayers,

01:09:49.001 --> 01:09:52.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
she managed to organize the transportation

01:09:52.037 --> 01:09:54.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
and both our families went.

01:09:55.474 --> 01:10:00.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was amazing that this train had a special
carriage for people with disabilities,

01:10:01.413 --> 01:10:03.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were taken to this carriage,

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:07.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the train
was even delayed until we sat down.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were waiting for us.

01:10:11.423 --> 01:10:14.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we left, we informed the elders

01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:18.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we had made up our minds
and that we were going.

01:10:18.097 --> 01:10:21.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers sent us
a certain amount of money.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said, “This is to help you.”

01:10:24.603 --> 01:10:26.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we boarded the train,

01:10:26.605 --> 01:10:29.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
we found out
that we had to pay for the train,

01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:33.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
although before that,
all evacuation trains were free.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told us the amount for the tickets,

01:10:35.881 --> 01:10:40.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was exactly the same
as what the brothers had given us.

01:10:41.053 --> 01:10:45.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only opportunity
for me to leave was by evacuation train.

01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:50.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually a compartment
is designed for 4 people;

01:10:50.362 --> 01:10:52.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ours there were 13 of us.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:11:00.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the train, I was traveling
with a family from my congregation.

01:11:01.707 --> 01:11:06.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to reduce our worries
and switch to something positive,

01:11:06.011 --> 01:11:10.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
we decided to take the opportunity
and preach to the people.

01:11:12.251 --> 01:11:14.920 line:10% position:50% align:center
We drove for 16 hours,

01:11:17.256 --> 01:11:18.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we arrived very late.

01:11:20.092 --> 01:11:23.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Lviv, a group of police approached

01:11:23.195 --> 01:11:25.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took me
to the Security Service of Ukraine.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I have a Russian passport,

01:11:30.069 --> 01:11:32.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am essentially like an enemy to them.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:38.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that Jehovah was with Dad,
that He would protect him,

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:42.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that most likely
he would not be dragged there to prison

01:11:42.848 --> 01:11:44.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
or something like that.

01:11:46.118 --> 01:11:50.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I was worried that they might simply
not let us go further

01:11:50.255 --> 01:11:52.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we would stay in Ukraine.

01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:58.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sat and waited.

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed to Jehovah.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this helped me
not to focus on my negative thoughts

01:12:07.039 --> 01:12:09.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to trust Jehovah completely.

01:12:11.944 --> 01:12:14.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
They began to incite me
to say such slogans as

01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:18.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Glory to Ukraine!”

01:12:19.184 --> 01:12:22.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
I answered:
“I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:12:22.287 --> 01:12:24.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we take a neutral position in this war.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:27.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We do not support the Russian side,

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:31.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I also cannot glorify
some other country.”

01:12:36.235 --> 01:12:39.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he told me to curse Putin.

01:12:39.104 --> 01:12:42.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Well, since I am a believer,

01:12:43.976 --> 01:12:48.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cannot speak swear words
so I cannot say this either.”

01:12:50.716 --> 01:12:54.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the policeman said:
“Yes, I know your people.

01:12:54.653 --> 01:12:57.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t want to defend their homeland.”

01:12:57.156 --> 01:13:00.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
I replied, “Well, if I were a conscript,

01:13:00.526 --> 01:13:03.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would fight against Ukraine now,
since I am Russian.”

01:13:04.129 --> 01:13:07.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Well, then save your family.

01:13:07.833 --> 01:13:09.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go with God, Alexsei!”

01:13:11.537 --> 01:13:15.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave me back my documents
and wished me a good journey.

01:13:15.874 --> 01:13:19.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
We waited at the border for about 17 hours.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:24.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
The difficulty was that it was very cold.

01:13:24.216 --> 01:13:28.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
The car got cold quickly,
and there were no toilets.

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it was our turn to be checked,

01:13:30.456 --> 01:13:33.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
we spoke to the female border guard
and explained to her

01:13:33.692 --> 01:13:36.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I could go into labor at any time

01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:38.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I really needed my husband’s help

01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:41.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I couldn’t even carry my own bag.

01:13:41.366 --> 01:13:45.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then she told me that if I wanted,
I could stay in Ukraine,

01:13:45.537 --> 01:13:49.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there was no way
my husband would be allowed to leave.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:01.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our final destination
was the city of Chełm in Poland,

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:03.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we arrived.

01:14:03.889 --> 01:14:06.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was an outburst of emotions

01:14:06.291 --> 01:14:09.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the volunteers
quickly brought us to the sisters

01:14:09.962 --> 01:14:12.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we saw the jw.org sign.

01:14:12.764 --> 01:14:14.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were so many emotions.

01:14:16.668 --> 01:14:20.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is, well, it took our breath away,

01:14:20.405 --> 01:14:24.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we just couldn’t speak, and now, indeed,

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:28.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
this was the moment
when we understood that this is it;

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were saved!

01:14:33.585 --> 01:14:36.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we arrived at the Kingdom Hall,

01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:38.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were feeling really emotional.

01:14:41.193 --> 01:14:45.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very worried and nervous
about what was going to happen.

01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:49.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
But once we entered the Kingdom Hall,
we were able to calm down.

01:14:51.303 --> 01:14:53.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were a lot
of local brothers and sisters

01:14:53.705 --> 01:14:55.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
who greeted us with hugs.

01:14:55.774 --> 01:14:57.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many even had tears in their eyes

01:14:57.976 --> 01:15:00.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they saw
that I was going to have a baby soon.

01:15:00.979 --> 01:15:05.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment, we realized
that Jehovah and our brotherhood

01:15:05.284 --> 01:15:08.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
will take care of us as their own family

01:15:08.487 --> 01:15:11.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
in whatever circumstances we find ourselves.

01:15:14.059 --> 01:15:17.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sat in the Kingdom Hall
and didn’t know what to plan next.

01:15:17.496 --> 01:15:20.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elder who was on shift
at the Kingdom Hall

01:15:20.299 --> 01:15:23.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
took time for me,
and he encouraged me very much.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:27.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
He acknowledged everything
I had gone through and comforted me,

01:15:27.306 --> 01:15:29.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
letting me know that I was now safe.

01:15:29.675 --> 01:15:32.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
He assured me that Jehovah is with me

01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:36.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will continue to support me
and that I have no reason to fear.

01:15:37.549 --> 01:15:39.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember a moment

01:15:39.318 --> 01:15:40.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I went outside in the evening

01:15:40.686 --> 01:15:43.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the view of the Carpathian Mountains
opened up to me.

01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:47.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
The birds were singing.

01:15:47.025 --> 01:15:49.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
It strengthened me so much.

01:15:49.161 --> 01:15:51.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I remembered the thought
where a brother said

01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:53.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if Jehovah created all of this,

01:15:53.699 --> 01:15:55.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
won’t he help you?

01:15:57.035 --> 01:15:59.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, well, later I felt that power on me

01:15:59.771 --> 01:16:02.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
when everything began to resolve so quickly,

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:05.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t even think
that it would resolve that way.

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:09.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
My biggest fear
is probably the fear of the unknown,

01:16:11.783 --> 01:16:14.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now we see
that there is nothing to be afraid of.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:21.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a Disaster Relief Committee
that helped to accommodate refugees.

01:16:23.128 --> 01:16:25.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the sisters working with the committee

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:29.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
were looking for routes
and looking for transport

01:16:29.534 --> 01:16:33.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
—buses, trains, and planes.

01:16:35.507 --> 01:16:39.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were accommodated
with an amazing family

01:16:39.144 --> 01:16:42.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we felt really comfortable.

01:16:42.247 --> 01:16:45.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt completely understood.

01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:47.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is simply incredible.

01:16:47.986 --> 01:16:52.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah
has accompanied us all these years.

01:16:52.991 --> 01:16:56.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these years
we have been feeling his help,

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now it is just like an avalanche

01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:02.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
—an avalanche of miracles, help, and support.

01:17:04.069 --> 01:17:07.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Different brothers and sisters
began to visit us straightaway,

01:17:07.472 --> 01:17:10.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and each time there was someone new.

01:17:10.075 --> 01:17:12.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they always brought some bags or boxes.

01:17:14.746 --> 01:17:18.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for the non-Witnesses,
it was like a miracle.

01:17:18.517 --> 01:17:20.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they kept asking:

01:17:20.519 --> 01:17:23.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do you know them?
Are these your relatives?”

01:17:23.789 --> 01:17:26.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No, we have never seen them before.”

01:17:26.358 --> 01:17:28.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are they helping you?”

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, it was such a good witness.

01:17:32.364 --> 01:17:36.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
On March 24, exactly a month
after the war began,

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:41.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniil and I
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.

01:17:42.941 --> 01:17:47.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a great help
that a sister who could translate

01:17:47.312 --> 01:17:50.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
was present in the delivery room.

01:17:50.148 --> 01:17:52.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made me feel calmer.

01:17:55.787 --> 01:17:59.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
We try to speak
at every possible opportunity,

01:17:59.358 --> 01:18:01.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
sending each other text messages

01:18:02.627 --> 01:18:04.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and communicating via videoconferencing.

01:18:06.064 --> 01:18:10.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
I send Daniil videos and photos
of our little girl, Miroslava.

01:18:13.638 --> 01:18:16.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we constantly
reassure each other of our love

01:18:16.675 --> 01:18:19.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we appreciate each other very much.

01:18:23.982 --> 01:18:28.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feeling forced to move to another country
is very difficult.

01:18:30.889 --> 01:18:34.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
But thanks to Jehovah,
I have become convinced

01:18:34.593 --> 01:18:39.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his organization
really functions as one body.

01:18:42.701 --> 01:18:45.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I am very happy to be part of it.

01:18:47.205 --> 01:18:49.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brotherhood

01:18:49.207 --> 01:18:52.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these are the people
waiting for you with open arms.

01:18:54.212 --> 01:18:56.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt that

01:18:58.383 --> 01:19:03.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was Jehovah
who personally helped us.

01:19:04.556 --> 01:19:08.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is really evident that a lot of refugees
from Ukraine who come here

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:11.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
are alone with their problems,

01:19:13.131 --> 01:19:15.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is very difficult for them.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much easier it is for us

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:20.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we have
a friendly brotherhood with us!

01:19:20.872 --> 01:19:24.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although we are in a foreign country,
we feel at home.

01:19:24.976 --> 01:19:27.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
All thanks go to Jehovah!

01:20:30.275 --> 01:20:34.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was faith-strengthening,
wasn’t it?

01:20:34.279 --> 01:20:39.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt that Jehovah is going
to support us in any situation.

01:20:40.118 --> 01:20:43.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now we’re going to give attention
to Brother Tony Morris.

01:20:43.455 --> 01:20:44.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Tony.

01:20:44.623 --> 01:20:45.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, hey.

01:20:46.525 --> 01:20:48.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was your name again?

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:53.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Morris is going
to talk to us on the theme

01:20:53.765 --> 01:20:56.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They Will Be Sensational!”

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:01.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in a moment, I’ll explain what

01:21:01.907 --> 01:21:04.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be sensational.

01:21:04.609 --> 01:21:09.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, please open your Bibles
to Hebrews chapter 6,

01:21:09.614 --> 01:21:13.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
or find it on your phone or tablet.

01:21:15.554 --> 01:21:18.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul, here in this letter,

01:21:18.156 --> 01:21:22.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
is addressing those with the heavenly hope.

01:21:22.093 --> 01:21:25.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he makes a point here about two things

01:21:25.497 --> 01:21:30.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
he covers in verse 17 of Hebrews 6

01:21:30.435 --> 01:21:33.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
about “the promise” and the “oath.”

01:21:33.705 --> 01:21:38.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s “impossible for [Jehovah] to lie,”
as verse 18 touches on.

01:21:38.443 --> 01:21:43.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is what is connected with this hope

01:21:43.248 --> 01:21:46.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the ones that have the heavenly hope

01:21:46.084 --> 01:21:48.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by extension the other sheep.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s infallible.

01:21:52.924 --> 01:21:55.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to happen just as he promised.

01:21:55.961 --> 01:22:00.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Paul at least three times

01:22:00.265 --> 01:22:03.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced shipwreck;
that much we know.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:06.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we’ll find out there was more later.

01:22:06.204 --> 01:22:09.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what he writes here

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a heart full of experience

01:22:11.776 --> 01:22:14.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 19:

01:22:14.613 --> 01:22:16.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have this hope

01:22:16.715 --> 01:22:20.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as an anchor for the soul,

01:22:20.719 --> 01:22:24.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
both sure and firm,
and it enters in within the curtain.”

01:22:25.924 --> 01:22:28.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
The anchor

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s just critical

01:22:30.996 --> 01:22:34.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the other sheep
and the anointed

01:22:34.766 --> 01:22:37.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
have their anchor in shape.

01:22:37.936 --> 01:22:40.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, <i>The Watchtower</i>  just last year,

01:22:40.939 --> 01:22:43.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
February 20, 2021,

01:22:43.675 --> 01:22:47.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
on page 30,
mentioned this profound thought:

01:22:48.913 --> 01:22:53.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“An anchor stabilizes a ship during a storm

01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:57.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and stops it from drifting onto rocks.

01:22:57.689 --> 01:23:02.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But an anchor is useful
only if the chain that attaches to the ship

01:23:02.527 --> 01:23:05.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not break. . . .

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:09.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
[So] if we lose our faith, we lose our hope.” 

01:23:10.835 --> 01:23:14.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  has that profound thought

01:23:14.539 --> 01:23:16.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of God’s people.

01:23:16.675 --> 01:23:20.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
For now, we’re facing

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:25.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Revelation chapter 21 says
in symbolic language.

01:23:25.216 --> 01:23:28.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll turn to Revelation 21,

01:23:28.653 --> 01:23:31.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is why it’s so critical

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:36.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have this clear about our hope

01:23:36.027 --> 01:23:39.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
being the anchor there.

01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:42.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 1 of Revelation 21:

01:23:42.467 --> 01:23:45.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth;

01:23:45.637 --> 01:23:49.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the former heaven and the former earth
had passed away,

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:53.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
[now notice]
and the sea is no more.”

01:23:54.879 --> 01:23:59.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, “the sea is no more.”

01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:00.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we talking about here?

01:24:00.985 --> 01:24:04.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that means that after Armageddon,

01:24:04.589 --> 01:24:06.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no more “sea.”

01:24:06.925 --> 01:24:10.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously,
that’s not the literal oceans,

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:12.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the seas, there.

01:24:12.363 --> 01:24:17.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the demon-agitated sea
of wicked mankind

01:24:18.002 --> 01:24:19.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
—gone.

01:24:19.738 --> 01:24:21.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not gone yet.

01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:25.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just like in literal wars,

01:24:25.944 --> 01:24:29.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
submarines are used to sneak up on ships.

01:24:29.547 --> 01:24:33.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is the same way

01:24:33.284 --> 01:24:35.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he and his demon horde—

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:40.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he’s going to use any means he can

01:24:40.358 --> 01:24:42.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to wreck our ship.

01:24:42.694 --> 01:24:45.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an individual one-on-one with Jehovah.

01:24:45.597 --> 01:24:47.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know, many of you—

01:24:47.132 --> 01:24:49.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look out to you couples

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:52.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re very close;
you love each other.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:55.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know,

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
your mate
(for those of you who are married)

01:24:58.643 --> 01:25:01.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to have this kind of relationship

01:25:01.045 --> 01:25:03.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their Father, Jehovah.

01:25:03.948 --> 01:25:08.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody does unless you’re a toddler.

01:25:08.753 --> 01:25:11.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you’re going to be in God’s hands.

01:25:11.556 --> 01:25:16.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
If your parents are Witnesses,
there’s a good chance you’ll be OK.

01:25:17.328 --> 01:25:19.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is war.

01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:21.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the point.

01:25:21.399 --> 01:25:23.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is war.

01:25:23.635 --> 01:25:27.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s not going to get easier

01:25:27.972 --> 01:25:30.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
until “the sea is no more.”

01:25:30.642 --> 01:25:34.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, during these times,
in this war,

01:25:34.479 --> 01:25:37.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
we face stormy seas.

01:25:37.482 --> 01:25:40.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes a lot of things,
loss of material things.

01:25:40.985 --> 01:25:43.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are all kinds
of other storms that come up,

01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:48.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s connected
with the sea of wicked mankind.

01:25:48.092 --> 01:25:52.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this one here is the one
that we’re going to emphasize:

01:25:52.463 --> 01:25:54.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
the death of a loved one

01:25:57.969 --> 01:26:00.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the death of a loved one.

01:26:03.007 --> 01:26:04.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a storm!

01:26:05.877 --> 01:26:10.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is when our anchor is essential.

01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:16.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
As individuals, that anchor is essential.

01:26:16.654 --> 01:26:21.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never lose your anchor!

01:26:21.226 --> 01:26:23.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not saying
you’re not going to be battered

01:26:23.461 --> 01:26:25.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
or I’m not going to be battered,

01:26:25.029 --> 01:26:28.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
but don’t lose your anchor.

01:26:29.734 --> 01:26:32.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave it to us,

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:35.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Paul made that clear.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a sister wrote in,

01:26:38.076 --> 01:26:41.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I certainly wouldn’t name her.

01:26:41.412 --> 01:26:44.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
She may eventually see this program here,

01:26:44.782 --> 01:26:48.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I thought it was worth sharing with you.

01:26:48.686 --> 01:26:51.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she was honest and humble about it.

01:26:51.322 --> 01:26:54.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it shows, you know,
God’s people are imperfect.

01:26:54.259 --> 01:26:56.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know if you noticed that.

01:26:57.996 --> 01:27:00.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t say anything, David,
when you come out later.

01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:06.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
So her dad died faithful.

01:27:09.007 --> 01:27:12.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s what she admits
before her dad died.

01:27:12.577 --> 01:27:15.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says that when she saw others

01:27:15.079 --> 01:27:17.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
shedding tears after their loved ones died,

01:27:17.782 --> 01:27:19.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
she thought:

01:27:19.784 --> 01:27:22.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why do people cry so much?

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will see them again.’

01:27:31.562 --> 01:27:34.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would that comfort you
if you just lost a loved one?

01:27:34.933 --> 01:27:36.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:27:36.734 --> 01:27:40.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, her dad died.

01:27:40.772 --> 01:27:45.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what she honestly stated,
to her credit,

01:27:48.646 --> 01:27:52.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But now I understand.”

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:57.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she wept, shed tears.

01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:03.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the loss of a loved one
can be devastating,

01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:06.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt about it, an incredible storm.

01:28:07.966 --> 01:28:09.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now to our theme, 

01:28:09.968 --> 01:28:12.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“</i>They Will Be Sensational!,”

01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:15.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is “they”?

01:28:15.239 --> 01:28:20.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are family reunions in the new world.

01:28:22.413 --> 01:28:25.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
The things that are coming. Oh!

01:28:25.016 --> 01:28:27.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go ahead and use your imagination.

01:28:27.652 --> 01:28:30.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah won’t fault you for that.

01:28:30.154 --> 01:28:32.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re going to be sensational!

01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:34.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really are.

01:28:34.158 --> 01:28:38.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another word for “sensational”

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:40.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “astonishing”;

01:28:40.598 --> 01:28:43.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
another one is “astounding.”

01:28:43.568 --> 01:28:47.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s nice is this is not a fantasy.

01:28:47.372 --> 01:28:50.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what’s going to happen.
It’s a reality.

01:28:50.908 --> 01:28:55.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s consider
some families in Bible history.

01:28:55.913 --> 01:28:59.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, we’ll start with Noah.

01:29:01.452 --> 01:29:05.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was born in 2970 B.C.E.

01:29:05.823 --> 01:29:08.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
—126 years after Adam’s death.

01:29:08.726 --> 01:29:12.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he didn’t have any interaction with Adam.

01:29:12.463 --> 01:29:15.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think he got a blessing there, personally.

01:29:15.967 --> 01:29:18.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when his father, Lamech,
named him Noah

01:29:18.970 --> 01:29:22.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
(you know, that’s in scripture),

01:29:22.106 --> 01:29:26.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said:
‘This one will bring us comfort from our work

01:29:26.077 --> 01:29:28.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and from the pain of our hands

01:29:28.246 --> 01:29:31.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
resulting from the ground
which Jehovah has cursed.’

01:29:32.884 --> 01:29:34.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful expression!

01:29:34.152 --> 01:29:37.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know Noah lived up to that.

01:29:37.088 --> 01:29:40.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he lived,
he faced materialized angels.

01:29:41.659 --> 01:29:46.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
They left “their . . . proper dwelling place”
and produced offspring

01:29:46.130 --> 01:29:49.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those hybrid Nephilim.

01:29:49.133 --> 01:29:52.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ‘the earth became full of violence.’

01:29:52.403 --> 01:29:57.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Noah and his family,
they avoided all of that corruption.

01:29:58.209 --> 01:30:01.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he was faultless.
He “walked with the true God.”

01:30:01.012 --> 01:30:06.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he lived up
to what Jehovah expected of him.

01:30:06.017 --> 01:30:08.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
And find Genesis, if you would please,

01:30:08.953 --> 01:30:12.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to look at chapter 8

01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:15.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Genesis chapter 8.

01:30:15.893 --> 01:30:18.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now,

01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:21.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will mention this here

01:30:21.532 --> 01:30:25.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the chapter before 8,
which would be chapter 7,

01:30:25.603 --> 01:30:30.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do find the point in verse 13:

01:30:31.943 --> 01:30:34.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On that very day, Noah went into the ark

01:30:34.245 --> 01:30:38.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with his sons,
Shem, Ham, and Japheth,

01:30:38.182 --> 01:30:42.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
[and notice] and his wife
and the three wives of his sons.”

01:30:42.653 --> 01:30:43.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they went in the ark.

01:30:43.788 --> 01:30:45.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had all worked around it and everything.

01:30:45.957 --> 01:30:49.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we find in chapter 8,

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:53.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 16 and 17,

01:30:53.498 --> 01:30:56.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the Flood:

01:30:56.467 --> 01:30:59.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go out of the ark,

01:30:59.137 --> 01:31:02.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
you, your wife,
your sons and your sons’ wives.”

01:31:03.674 --> 01:31:06.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here we go.

01:31:06.511 --> 01:31:10.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we know
that’s just Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

01:31:10.014 --> 01:31:13.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the scripture said.

01:31:13.084 --> 01:31:17.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know the names
of the wife

01:31:19.357 --> 01:31:22.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the sons’ wives.

01:31:22.326 --> 01:31:24.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:31:25.596 --> 01:31:28.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can ask God,
but I don’t see anything in here

01:31:28.432 --> 01:31:31.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s going to tell me
why he decided not to have it in there.

01:31:31.369 --> 01:31:35.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,
it has nothing to do with being worthy.

01:31:35.439 --> 01:31:37.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s all about the lineage it went through.

01:31:37.708 --> 01:31:39.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, you know,

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:43.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all know better
than to argue with God.

01:31:43.347 --> 01:31:48.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know, God, I really love your word
but, you know, a couple of things here . . .’

01:31:48.986 --> 01:31:53.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not too bright to have that kind of attitude.

01:31:53.991 --> 01:31:57.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
So these are beautiful, faithful women.

01:31:57.361 --> 01:31:59.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s the point:

01:31:59.797 --> 01:32:04.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the new world, my,

01:32:04.435 --> 01:32:07.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a family reunion
they’re going to have!

01:32:08.406 --> 01:32:10.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how thrilled you’re going to be,

01:32:10.441 --> 01:32:13.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’m sure you’ve got some questions

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:15.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what that was like!

01:32:15.846 --> 01:32:17.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we don’t have much

01:32:17.882 --> 01:32:20.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
while they were on the ark;
how did things go?

01:32:20.518 --> 01:32:25.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, you know, a lot of the old-timers
here at Bethel and at other Bethels

01:32:25.423 --> 01:32:28.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
have so many stories, and they’re a pleasure.

01:32:28.593 --> 01:32:31.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, get ready.

01:32:31.562 --> 01:32:34.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’ll be a whole lot
of sensational stories

01:32:34.398 --> 01:32:39.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
from sensational family reunions
like this one.

01:32:40.304 --> 01:32:42.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a wonderful, wonderful future.

01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:46.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the same Bible book of Genesis,

01:32:46.277 --> 01:32:49.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s go over to chapter 21,

01:32:49.447 --> 01:32:52.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice here,

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:56.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a different example of a family

01:32:56.621 --> 01:33:00.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’ll enjoy a sensational reunion
in the new world.

01:33:00.091 --> 01:33:03.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
It highlights the fact
that Sarah became pregnant,

01:33:03.661 --> 01:33:07.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is the love of Abraham’s life,

01:33:07.398 --> 01:33:09.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far as humans go.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:14.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they bore a son together, Isaac.

01:33:14.205 --> 01:33:17.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is just incredible!

01:33:17.708 --> 01:33:22.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take chapter 22 of Genesis,

01:33:22.113 --> 01:33:25.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah gives this direction.

01:33:25.082 --> 01:33:29.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for any of you who are fathers
that are listening

01:33:29.287 --> 01:33:33.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and you don’t have to be a father
to be touched by this, obviously,

01:33:33.824 --> 01:33:37.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you love Jehovah
and you love Jesus),

01:33:37.962 --> 01:33:40.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
he says in verse 2:

01:33:40.164 --> 01:33:44.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take, please, your son,
your only son whom you so love.”

01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:48.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, he knew,

01:33:48.406 --> 01:33:52.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Abraham sure loves Isaac.’

01:33:52.176 --> 01:33:56.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is remarkable.

01:33:56.347 --> 01:33:58.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows he loves him so much.

01:33:58.582 --> 01:34:01.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does He tell him to do?

01:34:01.619 --> 01:34:03.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sacrifice him.

01:34:06.691 --> 01:34:10.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we don’t have all or any record

01:34:10.928 --> 01:34:15.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
of any feelings Abraham had during all this.

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get some indication
of some things going on here.

01:34:19.704 --> 01:34:21.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
But those of you

01:34:21.772 --> 01:34:25.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have ever had a son or sons,

01:34:27.011 --> 01:34:30.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
the impact here is just phenomenal.

01:34:30.247 --> 01:34:35.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did go all the way with the knife,

01:34:35.052 --> 01:34:37.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had actually,

01:34:37.288 --> 01:34:40.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
in mind and heart,

01:34:40.858 --> 01:34:44.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
committed the sacrifice.

01:34:44.628 --> 01:34:46.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah,

01:34:46.797 --> 01:34:48.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know, after he reached out with the knife

01:34:48.799 --> 01:34:51.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everything’s in motion,

01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:53.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had the angel call out

01:34:53.404 --> 01:34:56.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Abraham, Abraham!” just in time.

01:34:56.674 --> 01:34:59.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
That stopped the whole thing.

01:35:00.811 --> 01:35:02.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Abraham said: “Here I am!”

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:06.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he told him in verse 12:
“Do not harm the boy.”

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he feel?

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:12.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about a relief.

01:35:12.223 --> 01:35:15.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all this time before,
Isaac is wondering:

01:35:15.025 --> 01:35:17.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know, we got this all set up.

01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:19.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s the sheep?’

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:21.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:23.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
They must’ve had
some interesting conversations

01:35:23.968 --> 01:35:26.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
after these events.

01:35:26.003 --> 01:35:29.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, do you think
that they’re not going to enjoy

01:35:29.807 --> 01:35:32.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sensational family reunion?

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my!

01:35:34.111 --> 01:35:35.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then when they find out

01:35:35.913 --> 01:35:39.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
(because they didn’t know,
they heard certain things)

01:35:39.049 --> 01:35:41.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah,
he went all the way

01:35:41.886 --> 01:35:45.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowed the sacrifice with his Son.

01:35:45.623 --> 01:35:47.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.

01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:51.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
See that pain
—a lot of pain—

01:35:51.796 --> 01:35:55.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
so a sensational family reunion

01:35:55.065 --> 01:35:57.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Abraham, Isaac, Sarah,

01:35:57.101 --> 01:35:59.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other family members.

01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:03.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now another one in the scriptures
—let’s find Job,

01:36:03.808 --> 01:36:06.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how well we know

01:36:06.444 --> 01:36:10.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciate Job so much!

01:36:14.084 --> 01:36:18.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we go right there,
the first chapter,

01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:25.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
it just helps us to appreciate

01:36:25.162 --> 01:36:27.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the first chapter here;

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:31.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 1 talks
about this “upright man of integrity.”

01:36:31.235 --> 01:36:34.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 2 reveals

01:36:34.505 --> 01:36:38.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “seven sons
and three daughters were born to him.”

01:36:38.742 --> 01:36:41.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then all the livestock is mentioned.

01:36:41.245 --> 01:36:45.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is quite interesting,
in verse 4 of chapter 1:

01:36:45.549 --> 01:36:50.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Each of his sons
would hold a banquet at his house

01:36:50.187 --> 01:36:52.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his own set day.”

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:54.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s that all about?

01:36:54.325 --> 01:36:57.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have the gift of the <i>Insight</i>  book,

01:36:57.361 --> 01:36:59.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as so many other references.

01:36:59.530 --> 01:37:02.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this has always been a blessed gift.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:05.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Insight</i>  stated:

01:37:05.603 --> 01:37:10.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It would seem that Job’s seven sons
held a family gathering

01:37:10.541 --> 01:37:14.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(possibly a spring or harvest festival)

01:37:14.512 --> 01:37:18.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and as the feasting
made the week-long circuit,

01:37:18.449 --> 01:37:22.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
each son hosted the banquet
in his own house.”

01:37:24.021 --> 01:37:26.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a close family.

01:37:27.825 --> 01:37:31.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were all just such a close family

01:37:31.562 --> 01:37:33.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
that loved each other,

01:37:33.597 --> 01:37:35.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
just loved each other.

01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:40.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
we know in the following verses,

01:37:40.871 --> 01:37:42.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
the challenge of Satan in heaven

01:37:42.973 --> 01:37:46.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all that’s recorded for us here.

01:37:46.810 --> 01:37:51.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it starts in verse 13.

01:37:51.181 --> 01:37:53.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sons and daughters [are] eating” there.

01:37:53.217 --> 01:37:55.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the message comes to Job

01:37:55.786 --> 01:38:00.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the cattle and the Sabeans attacking.

01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:02.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, you see, the wicked one

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we never said he wasn’t smart,

01:38:05.596 --> 01:38:09.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
because see verse 16, “fire from God.”

01:38:09.099 --> 01:38:12.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, you know,
now they’re going to blame God for this.

01:38:13.938 --> 01:38:17.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan says, ‘Yeah, they are all going
to think it was God that did this,’

01:38:17.541 --> 01:38:19.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though he’s behind it

01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:22.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it falls from there and kills the sheep.

01:38:22.746 --> 01:38:26.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, then verses 18 and 19:

01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:27.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“While he was still speaking, . . .

01:38:27.952 --> 01:38:31.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Your sons and your daughters
were eating and drinking wine

01:38:31.555 --> 01:38:33.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in their oldest brother’s house.

01:38:33.724 --> 01:38:36.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly a great wind came.’”

01:38:36.727 --> 01:38:39.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, apparently,
Jehovah allowed that kind of power.

01:38:39.663 --> 01:38:42.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that case, it killed them all

01:38:44.802 --> 01:38:48.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
—dead, killed them—

01:38:48.639 --> 01:38:53.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
seven sons and three daughters.

01:38:53.544 --> 01:38:56.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s history.

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Job 42

01:39:00.618 --> 01:39:02.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Job chapter 42

01:39:02.987 --> 01:39:06.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
and,

01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:09.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
see, he’s been through the test,

01:39:09.293 --> 01:39:13.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we find here

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:16.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it mentions,

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know,
after the things have passed here

01:39:18.402 --> 01:39:22.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah doubled everything
and he’s rich again.

01:39:22.773 --> 01:39:26.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 13
—Job 42:13:

01:39:26.276 --> 01:39:30.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He also came to have seven more sons

01:39:30.114 --> 01:39:32.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
and three more daughters.”

01:39:32.616 --> 01:39:34.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that—?
I mean—

01:39:34.885 --> 01:39:37.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is just so wonderful.

01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:41.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, see, Jehovah is not finished with him

01:39:41.225 --> 01:39:44.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in the new world

01:39:44.428 --> 01:39:47.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and likely he’ll work out the timing)

01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:49.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll have all 20 children

01:39:51.468 --> 01:39:54.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Job, and his wife—

01:39:54.438 --> 01:39:59.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sensational family reunion!

01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:04.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now more to our day,
I just want to touch on—

01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:08.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just saw on the website

01:40:08.318 --> 01:40:10.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
on September 26th, I think,

01:40:10.354 --> 01:40:12.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful, beautiful story here,

01:40:12.356 --> 01:40:14.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it had been touched on
with an <i>Awake!</i>  before,

01:40:14.591 --> 01:40:17.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there’s David Maza’s life story,

01:40:17.861 --> 01:40:21.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A Happy Family, Shattered and Rebuilt.”

01:40:21.565 --> 01:40:26.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they talk about Davey, David,
or they call him Davey.

01:40:26.003 --> 01:40:30.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
I kept thinking,
‘Boy, what a sensational family reunion

01:40:30.941 --> 01:40:35.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re going to have during the new world!’

01:40:35.079 --> 01:40:37.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we know you precious brothers,

01:40:37.848 --> 01:40:41.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of you, are numb of heart,

01:40:41.351 --> 01:40:43.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
losing loved ones during these last days.

01:40:43.654 --> 01:40:47.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
But please don’t lose heart.

01:40:47.858 --> 01:40:50.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve got your anchor.
See?

01:40:50.694 --> 01:40:55.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the sister wraps it up for us here,
a dear friend of mine.

01:40:55.666 --> 01:40:59.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My mother and father had 17 children.”

01:40:59.269 --> 01:41:01.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just recently she wrote this:

01:41:01.638 --> 01:41:05.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Recently I lost the last remaining sibling,

01:41:05.175 --> 01:41:09.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“leaving me with no siblings at all.

01:41:09.079 --> 01:41:12.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Strangely, I remember where I was
and what I was doing

01:41:12.783 --> 01:41:15.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when I lost each of them.

01:41:15.753 --> 01:41:17.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What a blessing it will be

01:41:17.788 --> 01:41:21.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when these dreaded memories
will be gone and replaced

01:41:21.892 --> 01:41:24.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when I see my resurrected mom and dad

01:41:24.294 --> 01:41:27.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and welcome back each child

01:41:27.397 --> 01:41:29.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s stored in Jehovah’s memory!”

01:41:30.367 --> 01:41:34.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
She writes:
“What a grand reunion that will be

01:41:34.371 --> 01:41:36.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as we gradually grow to perfection

01:41:36.607 --> 01:41:40.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the prospect of living forever!”

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:43.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a touching expression
from our precious sister!

01:41:43.814 --> 01:41:48.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the reunion with your loved ones
is a certainty.

01:41:48.318 --> 01:41:50.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will be enjoying

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
your family reunions soon.

01:41:56.026 --> 01:41:58.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep your anchor in good shape

01:41:58.695 --> 01:42:01.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the sea of wicked mankind is no more.

01:42:01.298 --> 01:42:02.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we entreat you;

01:42:02.933 --> 01:42:08.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
focus on the coming
sensational family reunions.

01:42:25.956 --> 01:42:28.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, wasn’t that touching?

01:42:29.927 --> 01:42:31.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really encouraging.

01:42:31.428 --> 01:42:34.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we appreciate that very much, Tony.

01:42:34.932 --> 01:42:37.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at this time,
I have an announcement to make,

01:42:37.167 --> 01:42:42.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it concerns the worldwide Bethel family

01:42:42.172 --> 01:42:46.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the worldwide Bethel family.

01:42:46.143 --> 01:42:47.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you know,

01:42:47.711 --> 01:42:52.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders received training
at the School for Congregation Elders.

01:42:52.716 --> 01:42:55.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have a lot of elders at Bethel,

01:42:55.752 --> 01:42:59.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many of them have
a tremendous amount of experience.

01:42:59.623 --> 01:43:03.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they have a lot of responsibility too.

01:43:03.794 --> 01:43:05.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of them are overseers.

01:43:05.796 --> 01:43:08.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
They oversee large departments.

01:43:08.765 --> 01:43:12.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we do to meet their needs?

01:43:12.236 --> 01:43:14.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about a new course?

01:43:14.238 --> 01:43:18.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
A new course
for those in oversight positions:

01:43:18.876 --> 01:43:23.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called
Principles of Divine Oversight

01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:27.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
—A School for Overseers.

01:43:27.351 --> 01:43:30.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s let a couple of brothers
tell us more about it.

01:43:35.492 --> 01:43:38.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to the school for overseers:

01:43:38.395 --> 01:43:43.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Principles of Divine Oversight—Acts 6:3!

01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:47.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to read with me the verse 
that is the basis for this school

01:43:47.037 --> 01:43:49.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Acts 6:3:

01:43:50.107 --> 01:43:54.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, brothers, select for yourselves
seven reputable men from among you,

01:43:54.778 --> 01:43:56.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“full of spirit and wisdom,

01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:00.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we may appoint them
over this necessary matter.”

01:44:01.118 --> 01:44:05.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the rapid expansion of the work
taking place around the world,

01:44:05.289 --> 01:44:10.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a pressing need
for more loving and effective overseers.

01:44:10.193 --> 01:44:13.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you say
are the marks of a good overseer?

01:44:13.764 --> 01:44:18.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
An overseer’s primary job
is to take care of people.

01:44:18.969 --> 01:44:21.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbly accepts the reality

01:44:21.438 --> 01:44:25.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he does not know everything
or have all the answers.

01:44:26.243 --> 01:44:28.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t get stuck in the past.

01:44:30.213 --> 01:44:33.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be the point of contact
for your fellow workers.

01:44:34.618 --> 01:44:37.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good overseer is all of those,

01:44:37.421 --> 01:44:41.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he must also follow
the divine pattern of oversight.

01:44:41.758 --> 01:44:44.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Training is essential,

01:44:44.127 --> 01:44:47.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how it’s done is crucial.

01:44:47.564 --> 01:44:49.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
To this end,

01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:53.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Principles of Divine Oversight—Acts 6:3

01:44:53.003 --> 01:44:55.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
(a school for overseers)

01:44:55.138 --> 01:44:58.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help brothers in oversight
prepare others to become 

01:44:58.942 --> 01:45:02.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
loving and effective overseers
in the future.

01:45:02.879 --> 01:45:05.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
The school is rooted in Bible principles.

01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:11.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read together
the last scripture in Ezekiel chapter 48.

01:45:12.122 --> 01:45:14.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 35 says:

01:45:14.992 --> 01:45:19.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the name of the city
from that day on will be

01:45:19.162 --> 01:45:21.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah Is There.”

01:45:22.199 --> 01:45:26.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, when you apply
the divine pattern of oversight

01:45:26.103 --> 01:45:28.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
by proactively training others

01:45:28.438 --> 01:45:32.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and humbly keeping your “gates open”
to fresh lines of thought,

01:45:32.476 --> 01:45:35.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can be absolutely sure

01:45:35.112 --> 01:45:38.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will reward
your sincere efforts.

01:45:38.949 --> 01:45:43.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, divine blessings
will not only flow into your department,

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they will cascade
throughout your entire branch,

01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:50.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
bringing refreshment
and will continue spreading across the world.

01:45:50.961 --> 01:45:53.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah’s great spiritual city

01:45:53.497 --> 01:45:57.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue to grow and flourish!

01:46:07.177 --> 01:46:08.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a good course.

01:46:08.678 --> 01:46:12.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried it out already on a few Bethelites,

01:46:12.249 --> 01:46:15.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they appreciated it very much.

01:46:15.752 --> 01:46:18.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re sure that this
is going to be a real blessing

01:46:18.655 --> 01:46:22.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only here in the United States
but at Bethels around the world.

01:46:24.261 --> 01:46:27.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think is left to be revealed?

01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:31.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part 2 of the annual meeting
has more exciting announcements,

01:46:31.835 --> 01:46:34.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll watch it in next month’s broadcast.

01:46:35.605 --> 01:46:39.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we conclude, let’s travel to Niger.

01:46:40.444 --> 01:46:44.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Niger stretches
from the fertile deltas of the Niger River

01:46:44.347 --> 01:46:47.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the grand Sahara Desert.

01:46:48.018 --> 01:46:50.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
With such drastic differences
between locations,

01:46:52.389 --> 01:46:55.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
publishers need to use
a variety of preaching methods.

01:46:56.226 --> 01:46:58.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the capital city of Niamey,

01:46:58.495 --> 01:47:01.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
they reach commuters
walking the busy streets.

01:47:02.999 --> 01:47:05.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
In remote desert cities,
they seek out merchants

01:47:05.802 --> 01:47:07.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wade through fertile riverbeds

01:47:07.804 --> 01:47:10.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find farmers
tending their crops in paddies.

01:47:12.175 --> 01:47:14.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
While in the desert,

01:47:14.544 --> 01:47:18.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
many publishers preach
wearing a combined turban and veil,

01:47:18.148 --> 01:47:21.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
which protects them
from the windblown sand.

01:47:21.151 --> 01:47:24.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tough conditions are made bearable

01:47:24.087 --> 01:47:26.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Nigerien people

01:47:26.123 --> 01:47:28.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
are so hospitable.

01:47:28.225 --> 01:47:31.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a common phrase
in the local language Hausa

01:47:31.194 --> 01:47:33.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
that translates to

01:47:33.697 --> 01:47:36.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your guest is your king.”

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:40.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many will stop and listen to what
our brothers show them from the Bible.

01:47:42.305 --> 01:47:45.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both young and old in Niger
count it a privilege

01:47:45.775 --> 01:47:49.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
to announce God’s Kingdom
and to enjoy spiritual food.

01:47:50.981 --> 01:47:52.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a pleasure to share with you

01:47:52.582 --> 01:47:56.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the love and greetings
of our dear brothers

01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:59.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Bobiel, Haro Banda Zarma,

01:47:59.823 --> 01:48:02.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Arlit congregations.

01:48:03.693 --> 01:48:07.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:48:07.364 --> 01:48:10.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
