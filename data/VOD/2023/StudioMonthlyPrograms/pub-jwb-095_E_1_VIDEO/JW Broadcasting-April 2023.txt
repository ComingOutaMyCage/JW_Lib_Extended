00:00:02 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:05 This month, we’ll discuss something
00:00:08 that’s easy to talk about but difficult to do
00:00:12 —making wise decisions.
00:00:15 We’ll hear what wise choices Greg and Joren Harris made
00:00:19 as they raised their children.
00:00:21 We’ll also catch up with Enrique Torres,
00:00:24 a man who made great changes in his life,
00:00:27 and we’ll learn what helped him stick to those changes.
00:00:32 And the latest episode of Iron Sharpens Iron
00:00:35 will show us how to be adaptable in our ministry.
00:00:39 This is JW Broadcasting for April 2023!
00:01:03 The theme of this month’s program
00:01:05 is “Make Wise Decisions.”
00:01:08 And our discussion is based on Job 34:11.
00:01:13 Let’s read that together:
00:01:16 “For he [Jehovah] will reward a man
00:01:19 “according to what he does
00:01:21 and bring upon him the consequences of his ways.”
00:01:28 As highlighted in this scripture,
00:01:30 our actions are very important.
00:01:33 And our actions are usually the result
00:01:36 of decisions we make.
00:01:38 Some decisions are made after a lot of serious thought.
00:01:42 Others, though, are made very quickly.
00:01:46 But no matter how much thought goes into making a decision,
00:01:50 we need to recognize this basic fact:
00:01:54 Wise decisions bring positive rewards,
00:01:59 and wrong decisions can result in very negative consequences.
00:02:05 Of course, all of us want to make wise decisions.
00:02:08 But what are wise decisions?
00:02:12 Wise decisions are those that please our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:02:19 Most of us have already made some very good decisions.
00:02:22 These include the big decisions in life,
00:02:25 such as dedicating ourselves to Jehovah
00:02:28 and getting baptized
00:02:30 and deciding not to become involved
00:02:32 in the religious and political disputes of this world.
00:02:36 No doubt, before we made those major decisions,
00:02:40 we spent a lot of time praying about them
00:02:42 and seeking Jehovah’s direction.
00:02:45 And we’ve seen his blessing in our lives
00:02:48 because of these right decisions.
00:02:51 In this program, though,
00:02:53 we won’t be discussing such major decisions.
00:02:57 Rather, we’ll focus on decisions
00:03:00 that may be viewed by some as minor.
00:03:04 However, some of these
00:03:06 can lead to very serious consequences.
00:03:10 First, we’ll consider a Bible example
00:03:13 of a person who served Jehovah
00:03:15 and yet made some wrong decisions along the way.
00:03:19 We’ll analyze what caused this faithful servant
00:03:22 to make these wrong decisions.
00:03:25 Then we’ll consider what we need to do
00:03:29 in order to make wise decisions.
00:03:32 Finally, we’ll consider what we need to do
00:03:35 if we realize we’ve already made an unwise decision.
00:03:40 So to start, let’s discuss a faithful servant of Jehovah
00:03:45 who made some unwise decisions.
00:03:48 The example we have in mind
00:03:51 is that of King Jehoshaphat.
00:03:54 What was Jehovah’s view of King Jehoshaphat?
00:03:57 Let’s see the answer
00:03:59 at 2 Chronicles chapter 17
00:04:02 and verses 3 and 4:
00:04:05 “Jehovah continued with Jehoshaphat
00:04:08 “because he walked in the former ways of his forefather David
00:04:13 “and did not search for the Baals.
00:04:16 “For he searched for the God of his father
00:04:19 “and followed his commandment
00:04:21 and not the practices of Israel.”
00:04:25 That sounds like a wonderful commendation, doesn’t it?
00:04:29 Yes, Jehoshaphat was a faithful king.
00:04:33 He made the wise decision to worship Jehovah.
00:04:37 But even so,
00:04:39 he still made some very unwise decisions.
00:04:44 Let’s read about one of those unwise decisions
00:04:47 at 2 Chronicles 18:1:
00:04:53 “Jehoshaphat had riches and glory in abundance,
00:04:58 but he made a marriage alliance with Ahab.”
00:05:03 Yes, he made his son marry Ahab’s daughter Athaliah.
00:05:08 Now, that was a very unwise decision.
00:05:10 Why?
00:05:12 Because Ahab had built a temple for Baal
00:05:16 and had even employed 850 false prophets.
00:05:21 Ahab was also married to wicked Queen Jezebel.
00:05:26 Who would want their child to marry into such a bad family?
00:05:31 What was Jehoshaphat thinking?
00:05:34 Why did he arrange for this marriage?
00:05:37 Perhaps he wanted to reunite the 12 tribes,
00:05:41 or he may have had some political and commercial motives
00:05:44 for wanting to have Ahab as an ally.
00:05:47 Even though we don’t know for sure the reason,
00:05:50 we do know there were consequences.
00:05:55 Because of this close relationship with Ahab,
00:05:58 Jehoshaphat felt obligated to support Ahab
00:06:02 in a war against the Syrians.
00:06:05 However, this led to yet another unwise decision.
00:06:10 As they were preparing for this battle,
00:06:13 Jehoshaphat asked for direction from one of Jehovah’s prophets.
00:06:18 Ahab, though, expressed his hatred for the prophet
00:06:22 and, after hearing the prophet’s message,
00:06:24 had him thrown into prison.
00:06:27 At that point, it was decision time for Jehoshaphat.
00:06:33 What did he decide to do?
00:06:36 Although he initially disagreed with Ahab,
00:06:39 he eventually joined him in the battle.
00:06:42 Jehoshaphat disregarded the warning from Jehovah.
00:06:46 But then this led him to still another unwise decision
00:06:51 —this time an incredibly foolish decision.
00:06:55 What happened?
00:06:57 Jehovah’s prophet had foretold
00:07:00 that the Israelites would lose their shepherd, or king, in battle.
00:07:04 So Ahab said that he would disguise himself
00:07:08 and not enter the battle dressed as a king.
00:07:12 He then said that Jehoshaphat should still dress like a king.
00:07:17 Now, just think about that for a moment.
00:07:20 Ahab was basically saying,
00:07:23 ‘You go out into battle with a target on your back,
00:07:27 and I’ll hide in disguise.’
00:07:29 Really?
00:07:31 Jehoshaphat’s decision to agree to do that
00:07:34 was not only unwise but also foolish.
00:07:37 It nearly cost him his life.
00:07:40 So why would he do that?
00:07:43 Insight on the Scriptures  says
00:07:45 that perhaps Jehoshaphat didn’t want “to go back
00:07:48 on his original promise to accompany Ahab.”
00:07:52 So maybe he would have lost face
00:07:54 if he backed out of the agreement at that point.
00:07:58 Although Jehoshaphat did survive the battle,
00:08:01 Jehovah sent another prophet to him
00:08:04 to say what’s recorded at 2 Chronicles 19:2:
00:08:10 “Is it the wicked you should be helping,
00:08:13 “and is it those who hate Jehovah you should love?
00:08:17 Because of this the indignation of Jehovah is against you.”
00:08:23 Although Jehovah acknowledged
00:08:25 the good things that Jehoshaphat had accomplished
00:08:27 in other aspects of his life,
00:08:30 Jehoshaphat clearly made some very unwise decisions.
00:08:35 What lessons do we learn from Jehoshaphat’s wrong decisions?
00:08:39 Lesson 1:
00:08:41 Just because we’ve done many good things in Jehovah’s service
00:08:46 doesn’t mean that we’ll always make wise decisions.
00:08:50 Lesson 2:
00:08:52 Making friendships with those who hate Jehovah
00:08:55 can put us under pressure to make other unwise decisions.
00:09:01 Lesson 3:
00:09:03 Even though we may seek Jehovah’s direction,
00:09:06 we must follow it if we want to make wise decisions.
00:09:11 Lesson 4:
00:09:13 If we realize that we’ve made an unwise decision,
00:09:17 don’t keep going in the same course.
00:09:20 Stop and change direction.
00:09:24 These lessons can be summarized
00:09:26 in the words of Proverbs 22:3.
00:09:29 There we’re told:
00:09:31 “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,
00:09:36 “but the inexperienced keep right on going
00:09:39 and suffer the consequences.”
00:09:43 Yes, we need to see the possible consequences of wrong decisions
00:09:48 and then take action to avoid them.
00:09:51 What were some of the consequences
00:09:53 of Jehoshaphat’s unwise decisions?
00:09:57 It nearly cost him his life.
00:10:00 His oldest son died an apostate.
00:10:03 And later, his daughter-in-law Athaliah
00:10:06 killed all the heirs to the throne except one baby
00:10:09 and set herself up as queen of Judah.
00:10:14 But you might be thinking,
00:10:17 ‘Still, Jehovah viewed Jehoshaphat as a good king.’
00:10:20 Yes, he did.
00:10:22 And it’s encouraging for us to know
00:10:24 that even if we have made some unwise decisions,
00:10:28 it’s possible that Jehovah may still view us as his faithful servants.
00:10:34 Does that mean, then, that our decisions are not so important?
00:10:40 The Watchtower  back in 1980
00:10:42 made this interesting comparison.
00:10:45 It used an illustration of two ship captains.
00:10:49 One skillfully maneuvered his ship through a storm,
00:10:53 bringing the vessel and his crew safely to shore.
00:10:57 But the other captain made unwise decisions,
00:11:01 and because of that, he experienced shipwreck
00:11:06 during the same storm, saving only his life.
00:11:08 While both captains escaped with their lives,
00:11:12 the one whose ship remained intact
00:11:15 would certainly enjoy greater happiness and honor, wouldn’t he?
00:11:20 It’s obvious which captain Jehoshaphat was like.
00:11:24 Unlike Jehoshaphat,
00:11:26 surely we’d prefer to be like the successful captain
00:11:31 —the one whose ship remained intact.
00:11:35 How can we make sure that we are like the successful captain?
00:11:40 Back in 2011, the April Watchtower
00:11:44 had a special chart entitled “Steps to Making Good Decisions.”
00:11:50 It listed these steps in making wise decisions:
00:11:55 (1) Avoid being presumptuous.
00:12:00 (2) Do research.
00:12:03 (3) Pray for wisdom.
00:12:06 (4) Make the decision.
00:12:09 (5) Implement the decision.
00:12:12 But then there was an additional step:
00:12:14 (6) Review and adjust.
00:12:19 Why is step 6 listed?
00:12:22 Well, from time to time,
00:12:24 we need to review decisions we’ve already made.
00:12:28 As we do so, perhaps we’ll come to realize
00:12:32 that some of them were not the best decisions.
00:12:36 Can you still be like the successful captain?
00:12:39 Yes, you can!
00:12:41 How?
00:12:42 If you courageously make the needed adjustments.
00:12:47 We must acknowledge that not all decisions
00:12:49 work out exactly as we had planned.
00:12:52 As Ecclesiastes 9:11 reminds us,
00:12:56 “time and unexpected events overtake [us] all.”
00:13:01 So, what should we do if that’s the case?
00:13:04 The same Watchtower  of 2011
00:13:07 answers that question for us.
00:13:10 After saying that Jehovah expects us to live up to such decisions
00:13:14 as our dedication and our marriage vows,
00:13:18 it went on to say:
00:13:20 “Most decisions, though, are less weighty.
00:13:24 “A wise person will from time to time
00:13:27 “review the decisions he has made.
00:13:31 “He will not let pride or stubbornness
00:13:33 “prevent him from adjusting
00:13:35 “or even reversing a decision.
00:13:38 “His prime concern is to make sure
00:13:41 that his life course continues to honor God.”
00:13:46 Thinking back to the illustration of the two captains,
00:13:49 at times they may need to reverse a former unwise decision.
00:13:55 That happened during a hurricane back in 1889.
00:14:01 The captain of the British ship Calliope
00:14:04 was anchored in the harbor in Apia, Western Samoa,
00:14:09 when a hurricane started blowing.
00:14:12 Initially, he decided, like all the other captains in the harbor,
00:14:16 to weather the storm where he was.
00:14:19 But as the waves grew in height and the dangers increased,
00:14:24 the captain realized he had made the wrong decision.
00:14:27 What did he do?
00:14:30 He courageously reversed his decision
00:14:33 and headed out to open sea.
00:14:36 It was difficult, but ultimately
00:14:39 he saved himself,
00:14:41 his ship, and the 250 sailors on board.
00:14:46 This bold act of courage entered him into the annals of naval history.
00:14:52 To be like that courageous captain,
00:14:55 at times we need to prayerfully reexamine our past decisions.
00:15:00 These could be decisions about our employment,
00:15:04 entertainment, education, or even where we live.
00:15:08 When we made the original decisions,
00:15:11 they may have seemed wise to us.
00:15:14 But do they still seem that way now?
00:15:18 If we see the dangerous winds of bad consequences
00:15:22 and the frightening waves of disaster approaching
00:15:25 because our decisions were not completely in harmony with Jehovah’s will,
00:15:29 what should we do?
00:15:31 Be like the wise captain.
00:15:34 Don’t worry about losing face.
00:15:36 Be courageous!
00:15:38 Pray for Jehovah’s help, and then take bold action.
00:15:42 Make the changes you need to make
00:15:44 in order to continue to please Jehovah.
00:15:47 In this way, you’ll make the wise decision
00:15:51 —the one that leads to success,
00:15:53 the one that Jehovah will bless.
00:15:58 One thing that will help us make wise decisions
00:16:02 is to remember the big picture,
00:16:05 not just what happens today,
00:16:07 but how this will affect our future.
00:16:10 In other words, don’t just think of now
00:16:15 —think of forever.
00:16:17 That’s the theme of our music video for this month.
00:16:29 In this world, it can be hard— Not just to follow your heart—
00:16:36 To be diff’rent and do what’s right.
00:16:45 But Jehovah tells us in his Word: ‘Don’t be molded by this world.’
00:16:53 He promises life in Paradise.
00:17:00 So stand tall; give your all.
00:17:08 Jehovah’s right there with you; he won’t let you fall.
00:17:16 And pray ev’ry day
00:17:23 To climb those mountains out there standing in your way.
00:17:31 Oh, don’t live for today; live for forever.
00:17:47 They will try and offer fame— Put a spotlight on your name,
00:17:54 Raise you up for all to see.
00:18:04 But rather than strive after wind, Jehovah says reach out to him.
00:18:11 He promises life in Paradise.
00:18:18 So stand tall; give your all.
00:18:26 Jehovah’s right there with you; he won’t let you fall.
00:18:34 And pray ev’ry day
00:18:42 To climb those mountains out there standing in your way.
00:18:49 Oh, don’t live for today; live for forever.
00:19:14 So stand tall; give your all.
00:19:22 Jehovah’s right there with you; he won’t let you fall.
00:19:30 And pray ev’ry day
00:19:37 To climb those mountains out there standing in your way.
00:19:45 Oh, don’t live for today; live for forever.
00:20:09 No matter how long we’ve been serving Jehovah
00:20:12 or what changes we face in life,
00:20:14 we can always keep our hope of living forever.
00:20:18 Reflecting on this hope
00:20:20 can help us make wise decisions at any stage in life.
00:20:25 Earlier we discussed that, at times,
00:20:28 we need to review a decision we made previously.
00:20:32 In our next segment,
00:20:34 a family decides to move to a foreign-language field.
00:20:38 Does this prove to be a wise decision for them?
00:20:42 Let’s see how things turn out.
00:20:57 Hey, you.
00:20:58 Are you ready?
00:21:15 The Haitian community in our area was growing,
00:21:21 and a new Haitian Creole congregation was formed nearby.
00:21:26 We checked out their territory
00:21:28 and saw that they needed a lot of help.
00:21:32 “Step on over.”
00:21:36 So should we do this?
00:21:37 I’ve been praying for more studies.
00:21:39 I think this might just be my answer.
00:21:41 Yeah?
00:21:42 I’m in.
00:21:43 Good. Then as soon as we get home, we can pray about it.
00:21:49 Our new language was exciting.
00:21:53 We spent every spare second we had
00:21:56 trying to get better.
00:22:02 We had so much joy,
00:22:04 but we had challenges too.
00:22:30 Nicolas,
00:22:32 Nicolas,
00:22:36 could you read the next paragraph for us, please?
00:22:40 Yeah, sorry. Where are we?
00:22:51 Our study was so nice today, wasn’t it, Nicolas?
00:22:55 It was.
00:22:57 And yet again, I was totally lost.
00:23:01 We didn’t realize that Nico just wasn’t finding
00:23:04 the same joy as us.
00:23:08 To help Nico, we did a few more things in our language.
00:23:14 Besides family worship,
00:23:16 we attended one meeting a month
00:23:18 with our old congregation.
00:23:21 Well, honestly, I’m a little worried about Nico.
00:23:24 He’s having a tough time adapting to our new congregation.
00:23:27 Hmm, I get it.
00:23:29 You know, back when we first joined a foreign-language congregation,
00:23:32 everything was fun and new.
00:23:34 But after a little while,
00:23:36 we noticed that our kids had lost their enthusiasm.
00:23:40 They were still hearing about Jehovah,
00:23:42 but, honestly, they weren’t learning because it wasn’t in their language.
00:23:45 Is that why you moved back?
00:23:47 It was.
00:23:48 But every family is different.
00:23:50 We each have to decide what’s best for our own.
00:23:53 Thanks, that’s true.
00:23:56 I found the perfect article
00:23:58 to help us decide what to do.
00:24:01 It mentioned the example of Daniel.
00:24:04 He had to speak different languages every day,
00:24:07 but he made sure to study in Hebrew, his language.
00:24:14 The article mentioned Psalm 119:11:
00:24:18 “In my heart I treasure up your saying.”
00:24:23 For Nico to treasure God’s Word in his heart,
00:24:27 we felt he needed even more guidance
00:24:30 in the language of his heart.
00:24:35 The truth is,
00:24:37 when I’m at the meeting in my language, it’s different.
00:24:39 I don’t have to think a lot just to understand what I’m hearing.
00:24:42 Well, I think it’s clear what’s best for our family.
00:24:45 It is.
00:24:46 But what about your students?
00:24:48 It’s OK, Nico. We’ll find a way to help them.
00:24:51 The language we’re immersed in every day is the language of your heart.
00:24:54 So it’s best for you to keep growing spiritually
00:24:57 in that same language.
00:25:01 It was the best decision
00:25:03 in order for Nico to stay close to Jehovah.
00:25:08 But we did miss the Haitian Creole field.
00:25:12 So a few years later . . .
00:25:15 Are you ready?
00:25:16 I’m a little nervous, but I think I’m ready.
00:25:23 We decided it was the right time
00:25:25 to move back.
00:25:29 We’re so glad our decision helped Nico
00:25:33 build a solid foundation
00:25:35 for his faith and his future.
00:25:41 How encouraging it was to be reminded
00:25:44 that when we make a decision,
00:25:46 we can always make adjustments later!
00:25:49 Have you ever made a decision that seemed wise at first,
00:25:54 but then over time, as things changed in your life,
00:25:58 didn’t seem so good?
00:26:00 Maybe you felt, ‘I’ll be a failure if I leave this assignment.’
00:26:05 Remember, our primary concern
00:26:08 must be to make sure that our life course continues to honor God.
00:26:14 Have the courage to consider making a change
00:26:17 if your circumstances have changed.
00:26:21 Greg and Joren Harris raised their children to love Jehovah.
00:26:26 What decisions did they make along the way?
00:26:31 When a person makes a sacrifice,
00:26:33 they give up something
00:26:35 for something that they consider
00:26:37 is of higher value.
00:26:38 What kind of a price tag can you put
00:26:41 on your child’s love for Jehovah?
00:26:46 What kind of a price tag can you put
00:26:48 on serving Jehovah whole-souled as a family?
00:26:53 When I found out that we were going to have a family,
00:26:57 it was overwhelming for me.
00:26:59 When you come into the truth—
00:27:01 We weren’t Witnesses when I was a child.
00:27:04 Sometimes you’re exposed to things that leave you with baggage,
00:27:09 leave you unsure of yourself.
00:27:11 You need constant reassurance that you’re going to be OK,
00:27:16 that you can take care of any situation that comes along.
00:27:21 My dad—he gave me all I needed.
00:27:24 He loved me so much.
00:27:26 I would take my mother’s knitting yarn,
00:27:28 and I would tie it to his door handle after he went to sleep.
00:27:31 And I would run it across the hall to my bedroom
00:27:33 and tie it to my big toe
00:27:35 so that when he opened his door in the morning,
00:27:37 I would wake up  and I could be with him.
00:27:39 That love that I had for my dad
00:27:43 —I wanted them to love Jehovah that much.
00:27:46 I wanted a string tied around their hearts right to Jehovah
00:27:51 so that he was the one motivating them
00:27:53 and he was the one waking them up spiritually every day.
00:27:58 I loved to teach the children things,
00:28:01 and I would do it at any available moment.
00:28:04 And then, of course, at night, as a family
00:28:06 (usually on our bed), we would read our Bible together.
00:28:09 It was the glue that kept us tied to Jehovah
00:28:14 and kept us tied to each other.
00:28:17 In Judges 7, Gideon said:
00:28:20 “Watch me and do . . . what I do.”
00:28:23 So I knew that if we wanted the children to live the truth,
00:28:29 we had to live it with them.
00:28:32 It couldn’t be something that we just taught them.
00:28:35 We had to live our life of service to Jehovah with them.
00:28:41 Jesus said that obviously we ‘can’t slave for two masters.’
00:28:46 And I’ve tried to do that and, believe me, it does not work.
00:28:51 Like any father, I wanted to have a home for my family.
00:28:55 My profession was building houses,
00:28:58 but that cost me my pioneering.
00:29:02 And so I decided
00:29:04 I had to quit building houses.
00:29:06 So I did.
00:29:07 I started to do remodel jobs.
00:29:10 And we looked for a place that we could afford
00:29:12 that would sustain us in the full-time service,
00:29:15 and Jehovah provided exactly what we needed.
00:29:20 One of the highlights of raising the children
00:29:23 was the annual visits to unassigned territory.
00:29:27 The success in the ministry was phenomenal.
00:29:30 So we decided as a family
00:29:33 to take on the challenge of learning Spanish.
00:29:36 We had a large Spanish-speaking population
00:29:39 in our territory and in the surrounding territories,
00:29:43 and there was no group or congregation to help them.
00:29:47 When we would go out of the country to preach, we would often stay
00:29:52 with family members of our Bible students
00:29:54 or our brothers and sisters in these countries,
00:29:57 in some very humble surroundings,
00:30:01 and we took advantage
00:30:03 of the hospitality that they offered us
00:30:05 because we wanted to live the culture with them.
00:30:09 It just opened our eyes to a world that we never knew existed.
00:30:16 Our family was able to progress
00:30:21 and flourish spiritually
00:30:24 because of a concentrated effort by Joren and me.
00:30:28 She’s been there to fill in all of the cracks.
00:30:30 He always made it so easy to love him,
00:30:36 to love the children, and to really focus on spiritual things.
00:30:40 When we pray to Jehovah,
00:30:43 thinking about our family being able to serve him like this,
00:30:47 we just say thank you.
00:30:49 We just try in some way to express how deeply we feel
00:30:54 about this privilege that we have
00:30:56 to be with Kaarsten and Kjersti and Andrea and Dhimo.
00:31:01 We don’t deserve
00:31:03 any of these blessings from Jehovah,
00:31:06 but somehow he’s blessed our efforts,
00:31:10 and he’s given us an opportunity to smile
00:31:13 and reflect on all of the things that he’s done for us.
00:31:17 And what can we do to repay Jehovah
00:31:20 but just keep going, keep trying,
00:31:23 and keep moving forward until we’re on the other side?
00:31:30 Thank you, Brother and Sister Harris ,
00:31:32 for sharing your experience in such a heartfelt way.
00:31:36 You decided to put spiritual things first in your children’s lives
00:31:40 and gave them the chance to have a friendship with Jehovah.
00:31:46 What happens to us in childhood
00:31:48 can shape who we become as adults,
00:31:51 for better or for worse.
00:31:55 If we don’t like who we are now, we can change,
00:32:00 as we’ll see in the latest installment of Where Are They Now?
00:32:14 Hello, who is it?
00:32:16 Hey, hi. How are you?
00:32:18 OK, come on up.
00:32:20 My name is Enrique Torres, Jr.
00:32:22 I live on Staten Island, New York,
00:32:26 and I have the privilege to serve in the Mid-Island Congregation.
00:32:42 The first 40 years of my life were mired
00:32:47 in a lifestyle that was horrendous.
00:32:51 A judge stated that I had
00:32:53 a “propensity for criminality.”
00:32:58 No doubt, he was describing a vicious person.
00:33:08 As a youth, I was hanging around with the wrong kind of people
00:33:12 that led me into a life of crime
00:33:15 and debauchery.
00:33:18 This captain in our prison came up
00:33:21 with a psychological plan
00:33:23 to take the individuals that had the potential for leadership
00:33:28 and put them in isolation.
00:33:31 I wound up to be among them.
00:33:34 Can you imagine, they were getting beat up?
00:33:39 It was becoming too much for me —the screams and so forth.
00:33:43 I said, “If this continues, I’m not going to survive here.”
00:33:51 I did get in contact with my father
00:33:54 and he told me:
00:33:56 “Never forget Jehovah.
00:33:57 That is his name.”
00:34:01 And that’s all I got out of it.
00:34:04 I knew that there was nobody that could help me but God.
00:34:08 So that’s when I found myself in prayer to Jehovah.
00:34:13 I vowed that I would make it my business to learn more about him
00:34:17 than just his name.
00:34:18 At that time, that’s all I knew.
00:34:21 I got some literature; I got the Bible too.
00:34:25 Jehovah became more meaningful to me.
00:34:28 That’s when he became real to me.
00:34:32 That was the first 40 years of my life.
00:34:35 But the last 40 years of my life
00:34:38 with Jehovah’s training from his organization,
00:34:41 my personality—it was transformed.
00:34:46 The blessings that I have received
00:34:48 have been in the area of my field service
00:34:51 and also my teaching ability,
00:34:54 which has helped me to be able to draw closer to Jehovah.
00:34:59 I was privileged to become a ministerial servant for many years
00:35:04 and a field service overseer for many more years.
00:35:09 One of the main challenges that I’m facing is
00:35:14 that I have developed cancer
00:35:18 and have gone through four cancer operations
00:35:22 and also some chemotherapy.
00:35:24 Without relying upon Jehovah to help me
00:35:28 to overcome these challenges,
00:35:31 there’s no doubt in my mind that I never would have been able to make it.
00:35:38 I would recommend to avoid that trap that I fell into
00:35:42 —hanging around with street gangs
00:35:45 and then getting involved in burglaries and robberies.
00:35:50 It’s a progression.
00:35:52 It was not anything of value at all.
00:35:56 Instead, what it brought me was a lot of grief,
00:36:00 mental scars, and also a lot of trouble with my conscience.
00:36:07 Study God’s Word, the Bible, so that you may be able
00:36:10 to see what Jehovah has in store for the future.
00:36:15 And also, you’ll be able to see that he’s a kind, merciful, loving God
00:36:19 that doesn’t want anyone to be destroyed but wants them to have life.
00:36:25 Parents, never give up on your children.
00:36:29 Jehovah never gave up on me.
00:36:33 He rescued me from this spiritual darkness that I was in,
00:36:38 and he brought me into his light
00:36:42 and to his wonderful organization.
00:36:45 And I give him all the credit for that.
00:36:49 And when I speak to people, that’s what I tell them.
00:36:51 I tell them: “It wasn’t me.
00:36:53 “It was Jehovah that has done all of this,
00:36:56 and he could do that for you too if you give him an opportunity.”
00:37:05 Early in life, Enrique’s poor choice of friends
00:37:09 led him to make many other bad decisions.
00:37:13 But in his 40’s, he decided to get to know Jehovah.
00:37:18 What a good reminder
00:37:20 that we can continue to make changes later on in life!
00:37:24 And you parents, please keep in mind
00:37:27 that the seeds of truth you planted in your children’s hearts
00:37:31 can move them to make good decisions later,
00:37:34 even as adults.
00:37:37 Some of our decisions may seem small,
00:37:41 yet they can have a powerful effect on our brotherhood.
00:37:45 In the next video, Brother Robert Luccioni
00:37:49 discusses how our response to someone
00:37:52 can make peace or break it.
00:37:57 So our Scripture text for today
00:37:59 discusses the qualities needed
00:38:01 “to walk worthily”
00:38:03 and in a way that pleases Jehovah.
00:38:05 Now, you notice our Scripture text,
00:38:09 Ephesians 4:1, is only a partial sentence.
00:38:12 Let’s read the entire sentence, which takes in verses 1-3.
00:38:16 Ephesians 4:1-3—he says:
00:38:20 “Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord,
00:38:22 “appeal to you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,
00:38:26 “with all humility and mildness, with patience,
00:38:30 “putting up with one another in love,
00:38:32 “earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit
00:38:36 in the uniting bond of peace.”
00:38:39 So here the apostle Paul links ‘walking worthily’ with unity,
00:38:44 and you notice the qualities that are needed to do that.
00:38:47 He says that we need ‘humility, mildness, and patience.’
00:38:52 Now, this is not the only time that the apostle Paul
00:38:55 links these three qualities with being in unity.
00:38:57 We may remember Colossians 3:12,
00:39:01 and it tells us to “clothe [ourselves] with . . .
00:39:03 humility, mildness, and patience.”
00:39:06 Why?
00:39:07 So that we can “continue putting up with one another.”
00:39:10 So why are these qualities so essential to peace and to unity?
00:39:14 Well, what do the Scriptures say about them?
00:39:16 Well, perhaps we think of the scripture
00:39:18 at Philippians 2:3, 4, which says:
00:39:21 “Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism,
00:39:24 but with humility consider others superior to you.”
00:39:27 See, that brings about peace and unity.
00:39:29 Or Proverbs 15:1:
00:39:32 “A mild answer turns away rage.”
00:39:36 Or Proverbs 25:15:
00:39:38 “By patience a commander is won over.”
00:39:42 See, humility, mildness, patience
00:39:46 —these qualities are so vital
00:39:48 for taking tension out of a situation
00:39:51 and allowing for humility and unity and peace.
00:39:56 Now, there are many accounts in the Bible that illustrate this fact,
00:39:59 and we’re going to consider just one
00:40:01 —that of the Ephraimites and Gideon.
00:40:04 If you look in your Bibles in Judges chapters 6 and 7,
00:40:07 it sets out the account of Gideon going against the Midianites.
00:40:11 We remember that in response to Jehovah’s direction,
00:40:14 Gideon won against Midian
00:40:16 —first with 32,000 men
00:40:18 and then finally weeded down to only 300 men.
00:40:21 Now, if you look in your Bibles, the Study Bible  map B6
00:40:25 helps us to visualize the strategy
00:40:28 that Gideon used with Jehovah’s direction.
00:40:31 Now, the Midianites
00:40:33 gathered near the hill of Moreh,
00:40:35 and you can see that here on the map.
00:40:38 And if you look at Judges 6:34,
00:40:41 we’re reminded
00:40:42 that “Jehovah’s spirit came upon Gideon.”
00:40:45 So here he’s operating under Jehovah’s spirit.
00:40:48 So, what did he do?
00:40:49 First off, he calls on the tribes of Manasseh,
00:40:52 Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to assist.
00:40:55 And that makes sense
00:40:56 because you can see where those tribes were
00:40:58 in relation to where the fighting was going to be.
00:41:01 Then at Judges 7:22,
00:41:03 Gideon’s initial attack
00:41:05 threw the Midianites into confusion.
00:41:07 And so the Midianites
00:41:09 fled south toward Abel-meholah.
00:41:12 Verse 23 of chapter 7 says
00:41:14 that he then calls on Naphtali,
00:41:16 Asher, and Manasseh
00:41:18 to chase after them and push them
00:41:20 toward the south, further south.
00:41:22 And you can see the logic in that.
00:41:25 But then in an excellent strategy
00:41:28 in verses 24 and 25, to head them off,
00:41:30 he also calls on Ephraim
00:41:33 to capture the waters as far as Beth-barah
00:41:35 and block their escape, and they do.
00:41:37 And they’re successful;
00:41:39 the two main princes of Midian are killed.
00:41:42 It’s victory —an excellent strategy—
00:41:45 one of the greatest and most courageous
00:41:48 and bravest battles in the Bible.
00:41:49 In fact, interestingly,
00:41:51 there’s no record ever again
00:41:53 of the Midianites bothering Jehovah’s people
00:41:55 after this victory.
00:41:57 Can you imagine having a share in that project,
00:42:00 how excited you would be?
00:42:02 Well, not everybody was.
00:42:04 Look at Judges 8:1;
00:42:08 it says: “Then the men of Ephraim said to him [to Gideon]:
00:42:12 “‘What have you done to us?
00:42:14 “Why did you not call us when you went to fight against Midian?’
00:42:17 And they quarreled bitterly with him.”
00:42:20 What was Ephraim’s problem?
00:42:22 Well, they felt they should have been involved earlier
00:42:25 or that perhaps the situation should have been handled differently.
00:42:28 ‘Why weren’t we involved? Why didn’t you call us?
00:42:30 ‘We didn’t know anything that was going on.
00:42:32 Then we had to drop everything and come and bail you out.’
00:42:36 Well, did Ephraim have humility, mildness, and patience?
00:42:40 Well, far from it.
00:42:42 And it was disrupting unity.
00:42:44 Now, how did Gideon respond?
00:42:46 Now, we remember, Gideon had Jehovah’s spirit
00:42:49 and he had an excellent strategy
00:42:51 that led to an outstanding victory for Jehovah.
00:42:53 How did he respond?
00:42:55 Well, look at verses 2 and 3.
00:42:57 It says: “But he said to them: ‘What have I done compared with you?
00:43:02 “‘Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?
00:43:07 “‘It was into your hand
00:43:09 “‘that God gave Midian’s princes Oreb and Zeeb,
00:43:13 “and what have I done compared with you?’
00:43:15 When he spoke this way, they calmed down.”
00:43:19 You see, Gideon showed humility,
00:43:22 mildness, and patience.
00:43:24 The result?
00:43:24 Everyone calmed down,
00:43:26 and Gideon was able to get on with Jehovah’s work at hand.
00:43:30 Now, we contrast that to the next time that the Ephraimites pulled the same trick,
00:43:35 as recorded in Judges chapter 12.
00:43:37 There you remember that they accused Jephthah
00:43:40 of not calling them into battle—same story.
00:43:43 What did Jephthah do?
00:43:44 Well, he says: ‘Well, I did call you into battle,
00:43:46 and you didn’t come, so I just did it myself.’
00:43:48 The next thing you know, they’re fighting among themselves,
00:43:50 completely distracted from carrying on Jehovah’s work.
00:43:54 What’s the lesson?
00:43:56 Well, the lesson is that things happen at times
00:43:59 that make peace go away.
00:44:02 Sometimes brothers in the congregation,
00:44:04 at Bethel, on a construction site
00:44:07 may react like Ephraimites.
00:44:10 Sometimes we react like Ephraimites.
00:44:13 ‘Why didn’t you ask my opinion?
00:44:15 ‘I was supposed to be involved in this.
00:44:17 ‘Why did you call me last minute when you knew you needed this two weeks ago,
00:44:20 and now I have to drop everything and help you out.’
00:44:23 See, that happens; we’re only human.
00:44:26 Well, when it happens, how will we react?
00:44:30 You see, unity is more important than who is right and who is wrong,
00:44:34 and Gideon understood that simple truth.
00:44:37 And unity is so important today.
00:44:41 There was an interesting, beautiful Watchtower  article
00:44:44 in 2014, December 15, and the article was entitled
00:44:48 “Facing the End of This Old World Together.”
00:44:50 And it stated this; it said:
00:44:53 “One of the darkest periods in human history nears. . . .
00:44:57 For God’s people, it will be a time for unity.”
00:45:02 It goes on to say:
00:45:03 “During the coming time of trouble for this system,
00:45:06 we will have to be truly united.”
00:45:09 So let me ask you,
00:45:11 Do you think it’s any coincidence
00:45:13 that here, where we are in the stream of time,
00:45:15 that we see Jehovah pulling his organization
00:45:19 closer and closer together in unity?
00:45:21 Is it any coincidence that we hear over and over again
00:45:25 of the need for peace and for unity?
00:45:27 No!
00:45:28 You see, as this world gets more and more divided,
00:45:30 fragmented, fighting,
00:45:33 we need to pull tighter and tighter together in unity.
00:45:36 And that requires that all of us
00:45:38 work on these beautiful qualities
00:45:40 of humility, mildness, and patience.
00:45:44 And when there’s a lack of unity, what do we have to do?
00:45:46 Well, we have to look at ourselves.
00:45:48 You see, generally we find
00:45:51 that the problem is me; it’s us.
00:45:54 Maybe we weren’t consulted as soon as we should have been.
00:45:58 Or maybe our idea of how the work or this thing should be done
00:46:02 wasn’t shared by others.
00:46:04 But in the grand scheme of things, does it really make a difference?
00:46:08 And many times when we look at a situation afterward
00:46:11 and we pull back unemotionally,
00:46:13 we generally find that, well, maybe our idea was pretty good,
00:46:17 but the timing wasn’t good.
00:46:19 Or maybe it wasn’t that great of an idea after all.
00:46:22 Or maybe there was more than one way for this thing to be handled.
00:46:26 Or perhaps Jehovah’s spirit
00:46:29 was leading things in a different direction.
00:46:32 Well, again, what can help us to not be an obstacle to unity?
00:46:37 Humility, mildness, patience
00:46:39 —just what we were considering in Ephesians chapter 4.
00:46:42 You see, we have to have the confidence
00:46:44 that if it’s important to Jehovah, it’ll happen.
00:46:48 And if not, what a shame it would be
00:46:50 if we become an obstacle to unity
00:46:53 over something that’s not that important to Jehovah!
00:46:57 You see, brothers and sisters, we need the “Gideons”
00:47:01 to help us in our support of the Governing Body.
00:47:04 Gideon was such a beautiful example.
00:47:06 Once he understood Jehovah’s direction,
00:47:09 he was willing to run into the fire for Jehovah and for his organization.
00:47:14 That’s what we need. We need “Gideons.”
00:47:16 We don’t need any more “Ephraimites.”
00:47:19 So in harmony with today’s text,
00:47:21 may each one of us walk worthily in these last days
00:47:25 and work on the qualities of humility, mildness, and patience.
00:47:29 And if we do, we will be a uniting force for good
00:47:34 and of Gideonlike value to Jehovah and the organization
00:47:38 in the troublesome days ahead.
00:47:41 When we’re humble and add to the peace of the congregation,
00:47:46 we make Jehovah happy.
00:47:49 As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:47:51 we cherish our privilege to share the good news with others.
00:47:55 What can help us be adaptable in our ministry?
00:48:00 Please enjoy the latest installment
00:48:03 of Iron Sharpens Iron.
00:48:07 Hi, I am Michalis, and this is “Iron Sharpens Iron.”
00:48:21 One challenge that often makes me nervous
00:48:24 is when I’ve prepared an introduction
00:48:26 and I’ve planned the conversation
00:48:28 but the householder doesn’t follow the plan
00:48:32 and I have to adapt.
00:48:34 Have you ever had that experience?
00:48:37 This could mean that what we prepared just won’t work.
00:48:42 So we are going to discuss four tips
00:48:45 that have helped me and hopefully
00:48:48 will help you be more adaptable.
00:48:52 The four tips are
00:48:54 (1) know your territory,
00:48:58 (2) make use of the Teaching Toolbox,
00:49:03 (3) anticipate
00:49:06 common objections or questions,
00:49:09 and (4) be flexible
00:49:12 and adjust to the householder’s needs,
00:49:15 because remember, this is meant to be a conversation,
00:49:20 not a sermon or a sales pitch.
00:49:25 Now, let’s look at a situation
00:49:27 where applying these four suggestions can help.
00:49:36 So, what introduction are you using?
00:49:38 I thought I would talk about economic problems.
00:49:41 Mm. Good idea!
00:49:43 It really suits the territory.
00:49:44 Thanks.
00:49:46 I’ll read Isaiah 65:21-23 and then offer the Kingdom  tract.
00:49:51 Perfect.
00:49:52 I’ll get the scripture ready.
00:49:54 Excellent.
00:50:06 Good morning.
00:50:08 Many people in our area struggle to make ends meet.
00:50:12 Do you think there will ever be a time
00:50:14 when we won’t have to stress about money?
00:50:16 Actually, now isn’t a good time.
00:50:19 I just received some bad news.
00:50:22 I’m sorry.
00:50:24 We’ll come back another time then.
00:50:26 Thank you.
00:50:32 OK.
00:50:34 Our sister applied our first two tips really well.
00:50:38 But our sisters are usually excellent when it comes to the ministry
00:50:42 so no real surprises there.
00:50:45 Did you notice?
00:50:47 First, she knew her territory well
00:50:50 and had a presentation designed specifically for it.
00:50:55 Second, her scripture and talking point
00:50:59 were taken from the tract What Is the Kingdom of God?,
00:51:03 which, as you know, is part of our Teaching Toolbox.
00:51:07 However, when the householder had something else on her mind,
00:51:12 our sister opted to return later.
00:51:15 That could be a good decision in this kind of situation,
00:51:19 but let’s see what would happen
00:51:22 if she were to ask just one more question
00:51:25 and adapt according to the householder’s response.
00:51:31 Actually, now isn’t a good time.
00:51:34 I just received some bad news.
00:51:37 I’m sorry.
00:51:39 Is there anything we can do to help?
00:51:42 No.
00:51:44 I, uh, I- I just heard that my sister has cancer.
00:51:48 Oh, that must be so difficult
00:51:52 for your sister
00:51:53 and for you!
00:51:56 Yes, when someone we love is suffering, we can often feel helpless.
00:51:59 That’s exactly how I feel.
00:52:01 If you have a moment,
00:52:02 could I show you something that I find comforting
00:52:05 about a time in the near future when our loved ones will never suffer again?
00:52:09 Hmm, I’d like that.
00:52:11 Notice what the Bible says
00:52:13 at Revelation 21:3, 4:
00:52:17 “With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say . . .”
00:52:24 Wow!
00:52:26 Did you see how she was able to offer this woman real comfort
00:52:30 just by being adaptable?
00:52:33 All it took was one simple question,
00:52:37 Is there anything we can do to help?
00:52:40 She was sincere and friendly, and the householder responded.
00:52:44 At that point, our sister applied our third tip.
00:52:49 She obviously was familiar with some common anxieties
00:52:53 of ones in that territory
00:52:55 because she smoothly transitioned
00:52:58 to the topic of suffering, which allowed her to listen
00:53:02 to the householder’s real concern
00:53:05 and then implement our fourth tip.
00:53:09 She adjusted to meet those needs.
00:53:12 Plus, she didn’t struggle to find information to use.
00:53:16 She stayed right there in her Teaching Toolbox.
00:53:21 Granted, not every situation will be as straightforward as this,
00:53:25 and it takes time and experience
00:53:27 to get comfortable moving from one topic to another.
00:53:31 But if we apply our four tips:
00:53:34 know your territory,
00:53:37 make use of the Teaching Toolbox,
00:53:41 try to anticipate common objections or questions,
00:53:45 and then adjust to the householder’s needs,
00:53:48 by applying these,
00:53:50 we’ll find very quickly that we are having meaningful conversations
00:53:55 and are able to share targeted truths
00:53:58 with those most in need.
00:54:02 As always, these are just a few techniques
00:54:06 that have worked for me,
00:54:08 and I hope they work for you.
00:54:11 Remember, part of the beauty of our ministry
00:54:15 is that we continue to sharpen one another.
00:54:21 What good suggestions!
00:54:23 In this example, the sister was able to start a conversation
00:54:28 with a simple “good morning.”
00:54:31 Of course, in real life, the way you greet people in your territory
00:54:35 might be different than what we saw in the video.
00:54:39 We hope you’ve enjoyed this month’s theme,
00:54:42 “Make Wise Decisions.”
00:54:45 Before we conclude,
00:54:47 we’d like to introduce you to our brothers and sisters
00:54:50 living in a land rich in Bible history
00:54:53 —Greece!
00:54:55 Greece is a mountainous country,
00:54:58 located at the southernmost part
00:55:01 of the Balkan peninsula,
00:55:02 with a rugged and diverse landscape.
00:55:05 It also includes more than 2,000 islands.
00:55:09 And with one of the longest coastlines
00:55:12 in all of Europe, this is a land of beautiful beaches
00:55:16 and sheltered coves.
00:55:19 Greece is known for its classic Mediterranean cuisine and delicacies
00:55:24 like moussaka, made from eggplant,
00:55:29 and dolmadakia, stuffed grape leaves
00:55:32 usually filled with rice and herbs.
00:55:35 A less familiar part of the Greek diet
00:55:38 is Chios mastiha, or mastic gum,
00:55:41 which is made from the sap of a tree
00:55:44 grown only on the small island of Chios.
00:55:47 In ancient times, people chewed mastic to freshen their breath;
00:55:51 it was an early version of chewing gum.
00:55:54 Today, it’s typically used
00:55:57 to flavor everything from bread to ice cream.
00:56:02 The preaching of the good news in Greece goes all the way back to the first century,
00:56:06 when the apostle Paul
00:56:08 first “[stepped] over into Macedonia.”
00:56:10 He landed in the seaport town of Neapolis,
00:56:14 known today as the city of Kavála.
00:56:17 And the preaching in Kavála
00:56:20 is still going strong, with four congregations
00:56:23 busy with public witnessing
00:56:26 throughout the city, including at the harbor
00:56:28 and at rest areas.
00:56:30 Kavála’s old city
00:56:32 is built on a hill,
00:56:34 where brothers and sisters
00:56:36 often climb many steep steps to reach the homes in their territory.
00:56:41 The branch office in Greece oversees the activity
00:56:45 of more than 30,000 publishers,
00:56:47 including 2,900
00:56:50 on the neighboring island nation of Cyprus.
00:56:53 They preach to a population of about 11 million people,
00:56:58 often in some of the very same cities
00:57:01 where Paul preached in the first century,
00:57:03 including Thessalonica, or modern-day Thessaloníki;
00:57:08 Beroea, or Véroia;
00:57:10 and the capital city of Athens.
00:57:13 We’ll end our visit to Greece back in Macedonia,
00:57:17 where our Greek brothers and sisters
00:57:19 send their warmest greetings from the Assembly Hall in Thessaloníki.
