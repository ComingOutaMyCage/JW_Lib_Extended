00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:05.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month, we’ll discuss something

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:12.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s easy to talk about but difficult to do

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
—making wise decisions.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll hear what wise choices
Greg and Joren Harris made

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:21.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they raised their children.

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:24.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll also catch up with Enrique Torres,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
a man who made great changes in his life,

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:32.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll learn what helped him
stick to those changes.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the latest episode of <i>Iron Sharpens Iron</i>

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:39.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
will show us
how to be adaptable in our ministry.

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:44.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for April 2023!

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
The theme of this month’s program

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:08.418 line:10% position:50% align:center
is “Make Wise Decisions.”

00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:13.423 line:10% position:50% align:center
And our discussion is based on Job 34:11.

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that together:

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:19.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he [Jehovah] will reward a man

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:21.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to what he does

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:26.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring upon him
the consequences of his ways.”

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
As highlighted in this scripture,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
our actions are very important.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:36.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our actions are usually the result

00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
of decisions we make.

00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:42.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some decisions are made
after a lot of serious thought.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:46.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others, though, are made very quickly.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:50.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no matter how much thought
goes into making a decision,

00:01:50.326 --> 00:01:53.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to recognize this basic fact:

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wise decisions bring positive rewards,

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wrong decisions can result
in very negative consequences.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:08.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, all of us
want to make wise decisions.

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are wise decisions?

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:17.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wise decisions are those
that please our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:22.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us have already made
some very good decisions.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
These include the big decisions in life,

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as dedicating ourselves to Jehovah

00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:30.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and getting baptized

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deciding not to become involved

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:35.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the religious and political disputes
of this world.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:40.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt,
before we made those major decisions,

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:42.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
we spent a lot of time praying about them

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeking Jehovah’s direction.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ve seen his blessing in our lives

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:50.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of these right decisions.

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:53.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this program, though,

00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:57.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t be discussing such major decisions.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, we’ll focus on decisions

00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:04.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may be viewed by some as minor.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, some of these

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:09.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to very serious consequences.

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:13.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we’ll consider a Bible example

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a person who served Jehovah

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:19.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet made some wrong decisions
along the way.

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:22.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll analyze
what caused this faithful servant

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:24.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make these wrong decisions.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we’ll consider what we need to do

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to make wise decisions.

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:35.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, we’ll consider what we need to do

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:39.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we realize we’ve already made
an unwise decision.

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:45.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to start, let’s discuss
a faithful servant of Jehovah

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:48.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made some unwise decisions.

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:51.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
The example we have in mind

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that of King Jehoshaphat.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Jehovah’s view
of King Jehoshaphat?

00:03:57.587 --> 00:03:59.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see the answer

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:02.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Chronicles chapter 17

00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:04.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 3 and 4:

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:08.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah continued with Jehoshaphat

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:13.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because he walked
in the former ways of his forefather David

00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:16.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and did not search for the Baals.

00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:19.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he searched for the God of his father

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:21.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and followed his commandment

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:23.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the practices of Israel.”

00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:29.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds like a wonderful commendation,
doesn’t it?

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehoshaphat was a faithful king.

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:37.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made the wise decision
to worship Jehovah.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even so,

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still made
some very unwise decisions.

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read
about one of those unwise decisions

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Chronicles 18:1:

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehoshaphat had riches
and glory in abundance,

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:02.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he made a marriage alliance with Ahab.”

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he made his son
marry Ahab’s daughter Athaliah.

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was a very unwise decision.

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:12.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:16.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Ahab had built a temple for Baal

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:21.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had even employed 850 false prophets.

00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:25.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahab was also married
to wicked Queen Jezebel.

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:31.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who would want their child
to marry into such a bad family?

00:05:31.047 --> 00:05:34.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Jehoshaphat thinking?

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:37.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did he arrange for this marriage?

00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:41.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps he wanted to reunite the 12 tribes,

00:05:41.157 --> 00:05:44.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
or he may have had some political
and commercial motives

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:47.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
for wanting to have Ahab as an ally.

00:05:47.897 --> 00:05:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though we don’t know
for sure the reason,

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:55.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do know there were consequences.

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:58.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of this close relationship with Ahab,

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:02.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat felt obligated to support Ahab

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:05.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a war against the Syrians.

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:09.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, this led
to yet another unwise decision.

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:13.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
As they were preparing for this battle,

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:18.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat asked for direction
from one of Jehovah’s prophets.

00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:22.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahab, though, expressed
his hatred for the prophet

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:24.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, after hearing the prophet’s message,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
had him thrown into prison.

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:32.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point,
it was decision time for Jehoshaphat.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:36.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he decide to do?

00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:39.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although he initially disagreed with Ahab,

00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:42.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
he eventually joined him in the battle.

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:46.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat disregarded
the warning from Jehovah.

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then this led him
to still another unwise decision

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:55.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this time an incredibly foolish decision.

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:57.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:06:57.934 --> 00:07:00.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s prophet had foretold

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:04.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Israelites would lose
their shepherd, or king, in battle.

00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:08.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Ahab said that he would disguise himself

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:12.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not enter the battle dressed as a king.

00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:17.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
He then said that Jehoshaphat
should still dress like a king.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:20.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just think about that for a moment.

00:07:20.723 --> 00:07:23.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahab was basically saying,

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:27.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You go out into battle
with a target on your back,

00:07:27.096 --> 00:07:29.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ll hide in disguise.’

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:31.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:34.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat’s decision to agree to do that

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:37.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not only unwise but also foolish.

00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
It nearly cost him his life.

00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why would he do that? 

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:45.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight on the Scriptures</i>  says

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
that perhaps Jehoshaphat
didn’t want “to go back

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:52.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his original promise to accompany Ahab.”

00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:54.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
So maybe he would have lost face

00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:57.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he backed out
of the agreement at that point.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although Jehoshaphat did survive the battle,

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sent another prophet to him

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say what’s recorded at 2 Chronicles 19:2:

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:13.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is it the wicked you should be helping,

00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:17.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and is it those
who hate Jehovah you should love?

00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:21.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of this the indignation
of Jehovah is against you.”

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:25.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although Jehovah acknowledged

00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:27.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
the good things
that Jehoshaphat had accomplished

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
in other aspects of his life,

00:08:30.526 --> 00:08:34.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat clearly made
some very unwise decisions.

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:39.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons do we learn
from Jehoshaphat’s wrong decisions?

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:41.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 1:

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:46.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just because we’ve done
many good things in Jehovah’s service

00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:50.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t mean
that we’ll always make wise decisions.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:52.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 2:

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:55.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making friendships with those
who hate Jehovah

00:08:55.718 --> 00:09:00.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
can put us under pressure
to make other unwise decisions.

00:09:01.157 --> 00:09:03.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 3:

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:06.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though
we may seek Jehovah’s direction,

00:09:06.562 --> 00:09:10.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must follow it
if we want to make wise decisions.

00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:13.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 4:

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:17.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we realize
that we’ve made an unwise decision,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t keep going in the same course.

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:22.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stop and change direction.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
These lessons can be summarized

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the words of Proverbs 22:3.

00:09:29.452 --> 00:09:31.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we’re told:

00:09:31.454 --> 00:09:36.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The shrewd one sees the danger
and conceals himself,

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the inexperienced keep right on going

00:09:39.962 --> 00:09:42.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suffer the consequences.”

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:48.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we need to see
the possible consequences of wrong decisions

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:50.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then take action to avoid them.

00:09:51.907 --> 00:09:53.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of the consequences

00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:56.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehoshaphat’s unwise decisions?

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
It nearly cost him his life.

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:03.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
His oldest son died an apostate.

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later, his daughter-in-law Athaliah

00:10:06.222 --> 00:10:09.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
killed all the heirs to the throne
except one baby

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:13.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
and set herself up as queen of Judah.

00:10:14.597 --> 00:10:17.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you might be thinking,

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Still, Jehovah viewed Jehoshaphat
as a good king.’

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he did.

00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:24.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s encouraging for us to know

00:10:24.674 --> 00:10:28.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even if we have made
some unwise decisions,

00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:33.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s possible that Jehovah
may still view us as his faithful servants.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:39.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean, then,
that our decisions are not so important? 

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:42.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> back in 1980

00:10:42.992 --> 00:10:45.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
made this interesting comparison.

00:10:45.761 --> 00:10:49.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
It used an illustration of two ship captains.

00:10:49.432 --> 00:10:53.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
One skillfully maneuvered his ship
through a storm,

00:10:53.202 --> 00:10:57.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
bringing the vessel
and his crew safely to shore.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:01.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the other captain made unwise decisions,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:06.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of that,
he experienced shipwreck

00:11:06.048 --> 00:11:08.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the same storm, saving only his life.

00:11:08.984 --> 00:11:12.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
While both captains escaped with their lives,

00:11:12.855 --> 00:11:15.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one whose ship remained intact

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:19.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
would certainly enjoy
greater happiness and honor, wouldn’t he?

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s obvious
which captain Jehoshaphat was like.

00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:26.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike Jehoshaphat,

00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:31.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
surely we’d prefer
to be like the successful captain

00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:33.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the one whose ship remained intact.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we make sure
that we are like the successful captain?

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:44.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 2011, the April <i>Watchtower</i>

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:49.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a special chart
entitled “Steps to Making Good Decisions.”

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:54.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
It listed these steps
in making wise decisions:

00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:00.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Avoid being presumptuous.

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:03.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Do research.

00:12:03.572 --> 00:12:06.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Pray for wisdom.

00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:09.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) Make the decision.

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:12.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
(5) Implement the decision.

00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:14.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then there was an additional step:

00:12:14.884 --> 00:12:18.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
(6) Review and adjust.

00:12:19.622 --> 00:12:22.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is step 6 listed?

00:12:22.057 --> 00:12:24.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, from time to time,

00:12:24.393 --> 00:12:28.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to review decisions
we’ve already made.

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:32.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we do so, perhaps we’ll come to realize

00:12:32.067 --> 00:12:35.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some of them
were not the best decisions.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you still be like the successful captain?

00:12:39.642 --> 00:12:41.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you can!

00:12:41.143 --> 00:12:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:45.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you courageously make
the needed adjustments.

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must acknowledge that not all decisions

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:52.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
work out exactly as we had planned.

00:12:52.822 --> 00:12:56.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Ecclesiastes 9:11 reminds us,

00:12:56.091 --> 00:13:00.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“time and unexpected events
overtake [us] all.”

00:13:01.063 --> 00:13:04.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what should we do if that’s the case?

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:07.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same <i>Watchtower </i> of 2011

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
answers that question for us.

00:13:10.506 --> 00:13:14.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
After saying that Jehovah expects us
to live up to such decisions

00:13:14.944 --> 00:13:18.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
as our dedication and our marriage vows,

00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:20.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
it went on to say:

00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Most decisions, though, are less weighty.

00:13:24.587 --> 00:13:27.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A wise person will from time to time

00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:31.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
“review the decisions he has made.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will not let pride or stubbornness

00:13:33.662 --> 00:13:35.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“prevent him from adjusting

00:13:35.664 --> 00:13:38.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or even reversing a decision.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His prime concern is to make sure

00:13:41.136 --> 00:13:44.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his life course continues to honor God.”

00:13:46.041 --> 00:13:49.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thinking back
to the illustration of the two captains,

00:13:49.845 --> 00:13:54.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
at times they may need
to reverse a former unwise decision.

00:13:55.451 --> 00:14:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
That happened
during a hurricane back in 1889.

00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:04.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
The captain of the British ship <i>Calliope</i>

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
was anchored in the harbor
in Apia, Western Samoa,

00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:12.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a hurricane started blowing.

00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:16.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Initially, he decided,
like all the other captains in the harbor,

00:14:16.672 --> 00:14:19.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
to weather the storm where he was.

00:14:19.575 --> 00:14:24.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as the waves grew in height
and the dangers increased,

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
the captain realized
he had made the wrong decision.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he do?

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
He courageously reversed his decision

00:14:33.756 --> 00:14:36.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
and headed out to open sea.

00:14:36.492 --> 00:14:39.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was difficult, but ultimately 

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saved himself,

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
his ship, and the 250 sailors on board.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:51.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
This bold act of courage
entered him into the annals of naval history.

00:14:52.942 --> 00:14:55.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be like that courageous captain,

00:14:55.377 --> 00:15:00.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
at times we need
to prayerfully reexamine our past decisions.

00:15:00.849 --> 00:15:04.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
These could be decisions
about our employment,

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:07.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
entertainment, education,
or even where we live.

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:11.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we made the original decisions,

00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:14.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may have seemed wise to us.

00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:17.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do they still seem that way now?

00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:22.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we see the dangerous winds
of bad consequences

00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:25.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the frightening
waves of disaster approaching

00:15:25.441 --> 00:15:29.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our decisions were not
completely in harmony with Jehovah’s will,

00:15:29.878 --> 00:15:31.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
what should we do?

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be like the wise captain.

00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:36.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry about losing face.

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:38.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be courageous!

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray for Jehovah’s help,
and then take bold action.

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:44.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make the changes you need to make

00:15:44.727 --> 00:15:47.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to continue to please Jehovah.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way, you’ll make the wise decision

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:53.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the one that leads to success,

00:15:53.936 --> 00:15:56.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one that Jehovah will bless.

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:02.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing that will help us
make wise decisions 

00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:05.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to remember the big picture,

00:16:05.147 --> 00:16:07.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just what happens today,

00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:10.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how this will affect our future.

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:15.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, don’t just think of now

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
—think of forever.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the theme of our music video
for this month.

00:16:29.138 --> 00:16:36.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this world, it can be hard—
Not just to follow your heart—

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:45.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be diff’rent
and do what’s right.

00:16:45.354 --> 00:16:53.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah tells us in his Word:
‘Don’t be molded by this world.’

00:16:53.662 --> 00:17:00.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
He promises life
in Paradise.

00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:08.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stand tall;
give your all.

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:16.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s right there with you;
he won’t let you fall.

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:23.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
And pray
ev’ry day

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:31.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
To climb those mountains out there
standing in your way.

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:43.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, don’t live for today;
live for forever.

00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:54.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will try and offer fame—
Put a spotlight on your name,

00:17:54.890 --> 00:18:02.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Raise you up
for all to see.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:11.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
But rather than strive after wind,
Jehovah says reach out to him.

00:18:11.974 --> 00:18:18.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
He promises life
in Paradise.

00:18:18.747 --> 00:18:26.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stand tall;
give your all.

00:18:26.655 --> 00:18:34.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s right there with you;
he won’t let you fall.

00:18:34.863 --> 00:18:42.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
And pray
ev’ry day

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:49.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
To climb those mountains out there
standing in your way.

00:18:49.511 --> 00:19:01.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, don’t live for today;
live for forever.

00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:22.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stand tall;
give your all.

00:19:22.644 --> 00:19:30.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s right there with you;
he won’t let you fall.

00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:37.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
And pray
ev’ry day

00:19:37.693 --> 00:19:45.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
To climb those mountains out there
standing in your way.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:56.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, don’t live for today;
live for forever.

00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:12.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how long
we’ve been serving Jehovah

00:20:12.227 --> 00:20:14.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what changes we face in life,

00:20:14.529 --> 00:20:18.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can always
keep our hope of living forever.

00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:20.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reflecting on this hope

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:24.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us make wise decisions
at any stage in life.

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:28.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier we discussed that, at times,

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:32.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to review
a decision we made previously.

00:20:32.047 --> 00:20:34.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next segment,

00:20:34.049 --> 00:20:38.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
a family decides to move
to a foreign-language field.

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:42.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does this prove
to be a wise decision for them?

00:20:42.024 --> 00:20:44.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how things turn out.

00:20:57.072 --> 00:20:58.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, you.

00:20:58.106 --> 00:20:59.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:21:15.991 --> 00:21:19.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Haitian community in our area
was growing,

00:21:21.263 --> 00:21:25.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a new Haitian Creole congregation
was formed nearby.

00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:28.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
We checked out their territory

00:21:28.603 --> 00:21:30.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saw that they needed a lot of help.

00:21:32.307 --> 00:21:34.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Step on over.”

00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:37.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
So should we do this?

00:21:37.646 --> 00:21:39.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been praying for more studies.

00:21:39.982 --> 00:21:41.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think this might just be my answer.

00:21:41.984 --> 00:21:42.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:43.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m in.

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:45.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good. Then as soon as we get home,
we can pray about it.

00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:52.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our new language was exciting.

00:21:53.762 --> 00:21:56.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
We spent every spare second we had

00:21:56.365 --> 00:21:57.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to get better.

00:22:02.304 --> 00:22:04.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had so much joy,

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we had challenges too.

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:31.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nicolas,

00:22:32.868 --> 00:22:34.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nicolas,

00:22:36.171 --> 00:22:38.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
could you read the next paragraph
for us, please?

00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:42.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, sorry.
Where are we?

00:22:51.686 --> 00:22:55.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our study was so nice today,
wasn’t it, Nicolas?

00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:57.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was.

00:22:57.392 --> 00:23:00.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet again, I was totally lost.

00:23:01.396 --> 00:23:04.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t realize
that Nico just wasn’t finding

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
the same joy as us.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help Nico,
we did a few more things in our language.

00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:16.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Besides family worship,

00:23:16.411 --> 00:23:18.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
we attended one meeting a month

00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:20.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our old congregation.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, honestly,
I’m a little worried about Nico.

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:27.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s having a tough time
adapting to our new congregation.

00:23:27.622 --> 00:23:29.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I get it.

00:23:29.357 --> 00:23:32.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, back when we first joined
a foreign-language congregation,

00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:34.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything was fun and new.

00:23:34.863 --> 00:23:36.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after a little while,

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:40.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
we noticed that our kids
had lost their enthusiasm.

00:23:40.035 --> 00:23:42.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were still hearing about Jehovah,

00:23:42.137 --> 00:23:45.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, honestly, they weren’t learning
because it wasn’t in their language.

00:23:45.974 --> 00:23:47.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that why you moved back?

00:23:47.709 --> 00:23:48.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was.

00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:50.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
But every family is different.

00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:53.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
We each have to decide
what’s best for our own.

00:23:53.582 --> 00:23:55.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks, that’s true.

00:23:56.218 --> 00:23:58.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found the perfect article

00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:01.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us decide what to do.

00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:03.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
It mentioned the example of Daniel.

00:24:04.326 --> 00:24:07.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had to speak
different languages every day,

00:24:07.629 --> 00:24:12.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he made sure to study in Hebrew,
his language.

00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:18.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article mentioned Psalm 119:11:

00:24:18.673 --> 00:24:22.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In my heart I treasure up your saying.”

00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:27.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Nico to treasure God’s Word in his heart,

00:24:27.516 --> 00:24:30.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
we felt he needed even more guidance

00:24:30.218 --> 00:24:32.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the language of his heart.

00:24:35.757 --> 00:24:37.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is,

00:24:37.192 --> 00:24:39.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’m at the meeting in my language,
it’s different.

00:24:39.661 --> 00:24:42.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t have to think a lot
just to understand what I’m hearing.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I think it’s clear
what’s best for our family.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is.

00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:48.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about your students?

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:51.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK, Nico.
We’ll find a way to help them.

00:24:51.206 --> 00:24:54.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
The language we’re immersed in every day
is the language of your heart.

00:24:54.709 --> 00:24:57.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s best for you
to keep growing spiritually

00:24:57.379 --> 00:24:59.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that same language.

00:25:01.249 --> 00:25:03.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the best decision

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:06.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order for Nico to stay close to Jehovah.

00:25:08.857 --> 00:25:12.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we did miss the Haitian Creole field.

00:25:12.394 --> 00:25:14.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a few years later . . .

00:25:15.564 --> 00:25:16.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:19.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a little nervous, but I think I’m ready.

00:25:23.238 --> 00:25:25.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided it was the right time

00:25:25.373 --> 00:25:27.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
to move back.

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:33.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so glad our decision helped Nico

00:25:33.248 --> 00:25:35.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
build a solid foundation

00:25:35.684 --> 00:25:39.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his faith and his future.

00:25:41.323 --> 00:25:44.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
How encouraging it was to be reminded

00:25:44.059 --> 00:25:46.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when we make a decision,

00:25:46.061 --> 00:25:49.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can always make adjustments later!

00:25:49.731 --> 00:25:54.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever made a decision
that seemed wise at first,

00:25:54.069 --> 00:25:58.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then over time,
as things changed in your life,

00:25:58.039 --> 00:26:00.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t seem so good?

00:26:00.508 --> 00:26:04.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you felt, ‘I’ll be a failure
if I leave this assignment.’

00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:08.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, our primary concern

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be to make sure
that our life course continues to honor God.

00:26:14.623 --> 00:26:17.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have the courage
to consider making a change

00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:20.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
if your circumstances have changed.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:26.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greg and Joren Harris
raised their children to love Jehovah.

00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:30.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
What decisions did they make along the way?

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.775 line:10% position:50% align:center
When a person makes a sacrifice,

00:26:33.775 --> 00:26:35.310 line:10% position:50% align:center
they give up something

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.012 line:10% position:50% align:center
for something that they consider

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:38.413 line:10% position:50% align:center
is of higher value.

00:26:38.413 --> 00:26:41.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of a price tag can you put

00:26:41.683 --> 00:26:45.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your child’s love for Jehovah?

00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:48.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of a price tag can you put

00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:51.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
on serving Jehovah whole-souled as a family?

00:26:53.061 --> 00:26:55.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I found out
that we were going to have a family,

00:26:57.098 --> 00:26:59.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was overwhelming for me.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you come into the truth—

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
We weren’t Witnesses when I was a child.

00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:09.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you’re exposed to things
that leave you with baggage,

00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:11.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
leave you unsure of yourself.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need constant reassurance
that you’re going to be OK,

00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:20.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can take care
of any situation that comes along.

00:27:21.022 --> 00:27:24.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad—he gave me all I needed.

00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:26.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loved me so much.

00:27:26.127 --> 00:27:28.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would take my mother’s knitting yarn,

00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:31.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would tie it to his door handle
after he went to sleep.

00:27:31.533 --> 00:27:33.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I would run it
across the hall to my bedroom

00:27:33.968 --> 00:27:35.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tie it to my big toe

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that when he opened
his door in the morning,

00:27:37.972 --> 00:27:39.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would wake up 
and I could be with him.

00:27:39.674 --> 00:27:43.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
That love that I had for my dad

00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:46.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I wanted them to love Jehovah that much.

00:27:46.848 --> 00:27:51.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted a string tied
around their hearts right to Jehovah

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:53.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he was the one motivating them

00:27:53.888 --> 00:27:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was the one
waking them up spiritually every day.

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:01.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved to teach the children things,

00:28:01.563 --> 00:28:04.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would do it at any available moment.

00:28:04.499 --> 00:28:06.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, of course,
at night, as a family

00:28:06.835 --> 00:28:09.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
(usually on our bed),
we would read our Bible together.

00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:14.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the glue that kept us tied to Jehovah

00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:17.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kept us tied to each other.

00:28:17.846 --> 00:28:20.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Judges 7, Gideon said:

00:28:20.582 --> 00:28:23.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Watch me and do . . . what I do.”

00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:28.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I knew that if we wanted
the children to live the truth,

00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:32.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to live it with them.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
It couldn’t be something
that we just taught them.

00:28:35.597 --> 00:28:40.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to live our life of service
to Jehovah with them.

00:28:41.736 --> 00:28:46.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that obviously
we ‘can’t slave for two masters.’

00:28:46.708 --> 00:28:49.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ve tried to do that and, believe me,
it does not work.

00:28:51.045 --> 00:28:55.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like any father,
I wanted to have a home for my family.

00:28:55.917 --> 00:28:57.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
My profession was building houses,

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that cost me my pioneering.

00:29:02.056 --> 00:29:04.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I decided

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:06.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to quit building houses.

00:29:06.561 --> 00:29:07.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I did.

00:29:07.796 --> 00:29:10.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to do remodel jobs.

00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:12.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we looked for a place
that we could afford

00:29:12.934 --> 00:29:15.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would sustain us
in the full-time service,

00:29:15.737 --> 00:29:18.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah provided
exactly what we needed.

00:29:20.308 --> 00:29:23.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the highlights of raising the children

00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:27.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the annual visits
to unassigned territory.

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:30.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
The success in the ministry was phenomenal.

00:29:30.585 --> 00:29:33.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we decided as a family

00:29:33.254 --> 00:29:36.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take on the challenge of learning Spanish.

00:29:36.424 --> 00:29:39.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a large Spanish-speaking population

00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:43.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our territory
and in the surrounding territories,

00:29:43.164 --> 00:29:46.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was no group
or congregation to help them.

00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:52.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we would go out
of the country to preach, we would often stay

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
with family members of our Bible students

00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:57.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
or our brothers and sisters
in these countries,

00:29:57.512 --> 00:30:01.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some very humble surroundings,

00:30:01.015 --> 00:30:03.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we took advantage

00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:05.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the hospitality that they offered us

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we wanted
to live the culture with them.

00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:14.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just opened our eyes to a world
that we never knew existed.

00:30:16.531 --> 00:30:21.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our family was able to progress

00:30:21.536 --> 00:30:24.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and flourish spiritually

00:30:24.138 --> 00:30:28.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of a concentrated effort
by Joren and me.

00:30:28.009 --> 00:30:30.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s been there
to fill in all of the cracks.

00:30:30.845 --> 00:30:35.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always made it so easy to love him,

00:30:36.351 --> 00:30:39.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love the children,
and to really focus on spiritual things.

00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:43.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we pray to Jehovah,

00:30:43.191 --> 00:30:47.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking about our family
being able to serve him like this,

00:30:47.228 --> 00:30:49.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
we just say thank you.

00:30:49.564 --> 00:30:54.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just try in some way
to express how deeply we feel

00:30:54.569 --> 00:30:56.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
about this privilege that we have

00:30:56.571 --> 00:31:01.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be with Kaarsten and Kjersti
and Andrea and Dhimo.

00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:03.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t deserve

00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:06.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
any of these blessings from Jehovah,

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
but somehow he’s blessed our efforts,

00:31:10.618 --> 00:31:13.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s given us an opportunity to smile

00:31:13.922 --> 00:31:17.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reflect on all of the things
that he’s done for us.

00:31:17.859 --> 00:31:20.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what can we do to repay Jehovah

00:31:20.562 --> 00:31:23.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just keep going, keep trying,

00:31:23.698 --> 00:31:27.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep moving forward
until we’re on the other side?

00:31:30.038 --> 00:31:32.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother and Sister Harris ,

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
for sharing your experience
in such a heartfelt way.

00:31:36.377 --> 00:31:40.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
You decided to put spiritual things first
in your children’s lives

00:31:40.882 --> 00:31:44.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave them the chance
to have a friendship with Jehovah.

00:31:46.321 --> 00:31:48.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happens to us in childhood

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
can shape who we become as adults,

00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:55.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
for better or for worse.

00:31:55.063 --> 00:32:00.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we don’t like who we are now,
we can change,

00:32:00.068 --> 00:32:05.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ll see in the latest installment
of <i>Where Are They Now?</i>

00:32:14.983 --> 00:32:16.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, who is it?

00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:18.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, hi. How are you?

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:20.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, come on up.

00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:22.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Enrique Torres, Jr.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:26.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
I live on Staten Island, New York,

00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:29.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have the privilege to serve
in the Mid-Island Congregation.

00:32:42.877 --> 00:32:47.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first 40 years of my life were mired

00:32:47.615 --> 00:32:51.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a lifestyle that was horrendous.

00:32:51.285 --> 00:32:53.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
A judge stated that I had

00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:56.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
a “propensity for criminality.”

00:32:58.626 --> 00:33:01.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt, he was describing a vicious person.

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:12.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a youth, I was hanging around
with the wrong kind of people

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led me into a life of crime

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and debauchery.

00:33:18.813 --> 00:33:21.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
This captain in our prison came up

00:33:21.983 --> 00:33:23.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a psychological plan

00:33:23.985 --> 00:33:28.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the individuals
that had the potential for leadership

00:33:28.656 --> 00:33:31.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put them in isolation.

00:33:31.225 --> 00:33:33.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wound up to be among them.

00:33:34.562 --> 00:33:37.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine, they were getting beat up?

00:33:39.567 --> 00:33:43.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was becoming too much for me
—the screams and so forth.

00:33:43.638 --> 00:33:46.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “If this continues,
I’m not going to survive here.”

00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:54.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did get in contact with my father

00:33:54.148 --> 00:33:56.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he told me:

00:33:56.184 --> 00:33:57.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Never forget Jehovah.

00:33:57.852 --> 00:34:01.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is his name.”

00:34:01.989 --> 00:34:04.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s all I got out of it.

00:34:04.592 --> 00:34:08.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that there was nobody
that could help me but God.

00:34:08.496 --> 00:34:12.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s when I found myself
in prayer to Jehovah.

00:34:13.668 --> 00:34:17.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
I vowed that I would make it my business
to learn more about him

00:34:17.038 --> 00:34:18.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just his name.

00:34:18.773 --> 00:34:20.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, that’s all I knew.

00:34:21.042 --> 00:34:25.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got some literature; I got the Bible too.

00:34:25.046 --> 00:34:28.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah became more meaningful to me.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:31.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when he became real to me.

00:34:32.286 --> 00:34:35.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the first 40 years of my life.

00:34:35.456 --> 00:34:38.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the last 40 years of my life

00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:41.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s training
from his organization,

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:46.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
my personality—it was transformed.

00:34:46.534 --> 00:34:48.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings that I have received

00:34:48.569 --> 00:34:51.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been in the area of my field service

00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:54.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also my teaching ability,

00:34:54.208 --> 00:34:58.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
which has helped me
to be able to draw closer to Jehovah.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:04.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was privileged to become
a ministerial servant for many years

00:35:04.385 --> 00:35:07.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a field service overseer
for many more years.

00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:14.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the main challenges that I’m facing is

00:35:14.762 --> 00:35:18.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I have developed cancer

00:35:18.332 --> 00:35:22.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have gone through four cancer operations

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also some chemotherapy.

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:28.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without relying upon Jehovah to help me

00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:31.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
to overcome these challenges,

00:35:31.512 --> 00:35:35.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no doubt in my mind that I
never would have been able to make it.

00:35:38.085 --> 00:35:42.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would recommend to avoid
that trap that I fell into

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hanging around with street gangs

00:35:45.426 --> 00:35:50.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then getting involved
in burglaries and robberies.

00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:52.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a progression.

00:35:52.433 --> 00:35:56.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not anything of value at all.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, what it brought me
was a lot of grief,

00:36:00.741 --> 00:36:05.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
mental scars, and also
a lot of trouble with my conscience.

00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:10.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Study God’s Word, the Bible,
so that you may be able

00:36:10.785 --> 00:36:15.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see what Jehovah has in store
for the future.

00:36:15.156 --> 00:36:19.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also, you’ll be able to see
that he’s a kind, merciful, loving God

00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:24.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
that doesn’t want anyone to be destroyed
but wants them to have life.

00:36:25.633 --> 00:36:29.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, never give up on your children.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never gave up on me.

00:36:33.507 --> 00:36:38.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rescued me from this spiritual darkness
that I was in,

00:36:38.512 --> 00:36:42.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he brought me into his light

00:36:42.149 --> 00:36:45.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to his wonderful organization.

00:36:45.086 --> 00:36:49.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I give him all the credit for that.

00:36:49.123 --> 00:36:51.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I speak to people,
that’s what I tell them.

00:36:51.525 --> 00:36:53.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tell them: “It wasn’t me.

00:36:53.794 --> 00:36:56.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was Jehovah that has done all of this,

00:36:56.464 --> 00:37:00.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he could do that for you too
if you give him an opportunity.”

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in life,
Enrique’s poor choice of friends

00:37:09.744 --> 00:37:13.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
led him to make many other bad decisions.

00:37:13.514 --> 00:37:18.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in his 40’s,
he decided to get to know Jehovah.

00:37:18.185 --> 00:37:20.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a good reminder

00:37:20.187 --> 00:37:24.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can continue
to make changes later on in life!

00:37:24.392 --> 00:37:27.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you parents, please keep in mind

00:37:27.995 --> 00:37:31.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the seeds of truth you planted
in your children’s hearts

00:37:31.465 --> 00:37:34.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
can move them to make good decisions later,

00:37:34.535 --> 00:37:36.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
even as adults.

00:37:37.972 --> 00:37:41.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our decisions may seem small,

00:37:41.442 --> 00:37:45.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet they can have a powerful effect
on our brotherhood.

00:37:45.947 --> 00:37:49.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the next video,
Brother Robert Luccioni

00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:52.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
discusses how our response to someone

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
can make peace or break it.

00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:59.327 line:10% position:50% align:center
So our Scripture text for today

00:37:59.327 --> 00:38:01.662 line:10% position:50% align:center
discusses the qualities needed

00:38:01.662 --> 00:38:03.698 line:10% position:50% align:center
“to walk worthily”

00:38:03.698 --> 00:38:05.833 line:10% position:50% align:center
and in a way that pleases Jehovah.

00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:09.270 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, you notice our Scripture text,

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.406 line:10% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:1, is only a partial sentence.

00:38:12.406 --> 00:38:16.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the entire sentence,
which takes in verses 1-3.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:1-3—he says:

00:38:20.514 --> 00:38:22.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord,

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“appeal to you to walk worthily
of the calling with which you were called,

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with all humility
and mildness, with patience,

00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:32.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“putting up with one another in love,

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“earnestly endeavoring
to maintain the oneness of the spirit

00:38:36.797 --> 00:38:39.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the uniting bond of peace.”

00:38:39.934 --> 00:38:44.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here the apostle Paul
links ‘walking worthily’ with unity,

00:38:44.939 --> 00:38:47.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you notice the qualities
that are needed to do that.

00:38:47.808 --> 00:38:52.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says that we need ‘humility,
mildness, and patience.’

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is not the only time
that the apostle Paul

00:38:55.216 --> 00:38:57.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
links these three qualities
with being in unity.

00:38:57.885 --> 00:39:01.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may remember Colossians 3:12,

00:39:01.222 --> 00:39:03.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it tells us
to “clothe [ourselves] with . . .

00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:06.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility, mildness, and patience.”

00:39:06.193 --> 00:39:07.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:39:07.161 --> 00:39:10.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that we can
“continue putting up with one another.”

00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:14.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why are these qualities
so essential to peace and to unity?

00:39:14.502 --> 00:39:16.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do the Scriptures say about them?

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps we think of the scripture

00:39:18.506 --> 00:39:21.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 2:3, 4, which says:

00:39:21.409 --> 00:39:24.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:39:24.245 --> 00:39:27.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with humility
consider others superior to you.”

00:39:27.415 --> 00:39:29.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, that brings about peace and unity.

00:39:29.483 --> 00:39:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Proverbs 15:1:

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A mild answer turns away rage.”

00:39:36.257 --> 00:39:38.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Proverbs 25:15:

00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:42.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By patience a commander is won over.”

00:39:42.696 --> 00:39:46.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, humility, mildness, patience

00:39:46.167 --> 00:39:48.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these qualities are so vital

00:39:48.402 --> 00:39:51.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
for taking tension out of a situation

00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:56.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowing for humility
and unity and peace.

00:39:56.377 --> 00:39:59.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there are many accounts in the Bible
that illustrate this fact,

00:39:59.213 --> 00:40:01.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to consider just one

00:40:01.082 --> 00:40:04.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that of the Ephraimites and Gideon.

00:40:04.351 --> 00:40:07.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look in your Bibles
in Judges chapters 6 and 7,

00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:11.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
it sets out the account
of Gideon going against the Midianites.

00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:14.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember that
in response to Jehovah’s direction,

00:40:14.328 --> 00:40:16.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon won against Midian

00:40:16.564 --> 00:40:18.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
—first with 32,000 men

00:40:18.566 --> 00:40:21.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then finally weeded down
to only 300 men.

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:25.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you look in your Bibles,
the <i>Study Bible</i>  map B6 

00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:28.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to visualize the strategy

00:40:28.642 --> 00:40:31.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Gideon used with Jehovah’s direction.

00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:33.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Midianites

00:40:33.114 --> 00:40:35.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
gathered near the hill of Moreh,

00:40:35.583 --> 00:40:38.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can see that here on the map.

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you look at Judges 6:34,

00:40:41.622 --> 00:40:42.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re reminded

00:40:42.723 --> 00:40:45.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Jehovah’s spirit came upon Gideon.”

00:40:45.759 --> 00:40:48.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here he’s operating
under Jehovah’s spirit.

00:40:48.395 --> 00:40:49.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did he do?

00:40:49.663 --> 00:40:52.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
First off, he calls
on the tribes of Manasseh,

00:40:52.466 --> 00:40:55.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to assist.

00:40:55.636 --> 00:40:56.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that makes sense

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you can see where those tribes were

00:40:58.339 --> 00:41:01.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
in relation to where the fighting was going to be.

00:41:01.308 --> 00:41:03.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then at Judges 7:22,

00:41:03.944 --> 00:41:05.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon’s initial attack

00:41:05.946 --> 00:41:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
threw the Midianites into confusion.

00:41:07.982 --> 00:41:09.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the Midianites

00:41:09.316 --> 00:41:12.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
fled south toward Abel-meholah.

00:41:12.453 --> 00:41:14.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 23 of chapter 7 says

00:41:14.688 --> 00:41:16.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he then calls on Naphtali,

00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:18.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asher, and Manasseh

00:41:18.459 --> 00:41:20.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
to chase after them and push them

00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:22.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the south, further south.

00:41:22.696 --> 00:41:25.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can see the logic in that.

00:41:25.266 --> 00:41:28.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then in an excellent strategy

00:41:28.269 --> 00:41:30.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 24 and 25, to head them off,

00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:33.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
he also calls on Ephraim

00:41:33.007 --> 00:41:35.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
to capture the waters as far as Beth-barah

00:41:35.843 --> 00:41:37.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and block their escape, and they do.

00:41:37.978 --> 00:41:39.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re successful;

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two main princes of Midian are killed.

00:41:42.616 --> 00:41:45.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s victory
—an excellent strategy—

00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:48.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the greatest and most courageous

00:41:48.189 --> 00:41:49.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bravest battles in the Bible.

00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:51.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, interestingly,

00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:53.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no record ever again

00:41:53.394 --> 00:41:55.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Midianites bothering Jehovah’s people

00:41:55.896 --> 00:41:57.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
after this victory.

00:41:57.765 --> 00:42:00.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine having a share in that project,

00:42:00.634 --> 00:42:02.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
how excited you would be?

00:42:02.803 --> 00:42:04.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, not everybody was.

00:42:04.772 --> 00:42:07.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at Judges 8:1;

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:12.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “Then the men of Ephraim
said to him [to Gideon]:

00:42:12.413 --> 00:42:14.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What have you done to us?

00:42:14.415 --> 00:42:17.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why did you not call us
when you went to fight against Midian?’

00:42:17.051 --> 00:42:20.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they quarreled bitterly with him.”

00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:22.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Ephraim’s problem?

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they felt they
should have been involved earlier

00:42:25.759 --> 00:42:28.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that perhaps the situation
should have been handled differently.

00:42:28.662 --> 00:42:30.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why weren’t we involved?
Why didn’t you call us?

00:42:30.864 --> 00:42:32.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We didn’t know anything that was going on.

00:42:32.666 --> 00:42:35.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we had to drop everything
and come and bail you out.’

00:42:36.003 --> 00:42:40.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, did Ephraim
have humility, mildness, and patience?

00:42:40.407 --> 00:42:42.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, far from it.

00:42:42.209 --> 00:42:44.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was disrupting unity.

00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:46.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did Gideon respond?

00:42:46.647 --> 00:42:49.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we remember,
Gideon had Jehovah’s spirit

00:42:49.183 --> 00:42:51.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had an excellent strategy

00:42:51.252 --> 00:42:53.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led to an outstanding victory
for Jehovah.

00:42:53.587 --> 00:42:55.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he respond?

00:42:55.322 --> 00:42:57.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, look at verses 2 and 3.

00:42:57.491 --> 00:43:02.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “But he said to them:
‘What have I done compared with you?

00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:07.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Are not the gleanings of Ephraim
better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?

00:43:07.234 --> 00:43:09.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It was into your hand

00:43:09.236 --> 00:43:13.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that God gave Midian’s princes
Oreb and Zeeb,

00:43:13.073 --> 00:43:15.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and what have I done compared with you?’

00:43:15.909 --> 00:43:19.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he spoke this way, they calmed down.”

00:43:19.313 --> 00:43:22.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Gideon showed humility,

00:43:22.149 --> 00:43:24.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
mildness, and patience.

00:43:24.084 --> 00:43:24.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result?

00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:26.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone calmed down,

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Gideon was able
to get on with Jehovah’s work at hand.

00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:35.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we contrast that to the next time
that the Ephraimites pulled the same trick,

00:43:35.262 --> 00:43:37.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded in Judges chapter 12.

00:43:37.498 --> 00:43:40.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you remember
that they accused Jephthah

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
of not calling them into battle—same story.

00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:44.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jephthah do?

00:43:44.605 --> 00:43:46.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he says:
‘Well, I did call you into battle,

00:43:46.173 --> 00:43:48.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you didn’t come,
so I just did it myself.’

00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:50.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next thing you know,
they’re fighting among themselves,

00:43:50.077 --> 00:43:54.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely distracted
from carrying on Jehovah’s work.

00:43:54.281 --> 00:43:56.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:43:56.317 --> 00:43:59.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the lesson is
that things happen at times

00:43:59.286 --> 00:44:02.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make peace go away.

00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:04.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes brothers in the congregation,

00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:07.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Bethel, on a construction site

00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:10.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
may react like Ephraimites.

00:44:10.497 --> 00:44:13.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we react like Ephraimites.

00:44:13.634 --> 00:44:15.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why didn’t you ask my opinion?

00:44:15.636 --> 00:44:17.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I was supposed to be involved in this.

00:44:17.638 --> 00:44:20.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why did you call me last minute when
you knew you needed this two weeks ago,

00:44:20.774 --> 00:44:23.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now I have to drop everything
and help you out.’

00:44:23.377 --> 00:44:26.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, that happens; we’re only human.

00:44:26.213 --> 00:44:30.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when it happens, how will we react?

00:44:30.384 --> 00:44:34.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, unity is more important
than who is right and who is wrong,

00:44:34.688 --> 00:44:37.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Gideon understood that simple truth.

00:44:37.991 --> 00:44:41.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
And unity is so important today.

00:44:41.795 --> 00:44:44.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was an interesting,
beautiful <i>Watchtower</i>  article

00:44:44.365 --> 00:44:48.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 2014, December 15,
and the article was entitled

00:44:48.369 --> 00:44:50.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Facing the End of This Old World Together.”

00:44:50.838 --> 00:44:53.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it stated this; it said:

00:44:53.474 --> 00:44:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One of the darkest periods
in human history nears. . . .

00:44:57.745 --> 00:45:02.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
For God’s people,
it will be a time for unity.”

00:45:02.216 --> 00:45:03.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
It goes on to say:

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:06.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During the coming
time of trouble for this system,

00:45:06.053 --> 00:45:09.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will have to be truly united.”

00:45:09.923 --> 00:45:11.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let me ask you,

00:45:11.625 --> 00:45:13.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think it’s any coincidence

00:45:13.927 --> 00:45:15.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
that here,
where we are in the stream of time,

00:45:15.929 --> 00:45:19.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we see Jehovah pulling his organization

00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:21.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
closer and closer together in unity?

00:45:21.535 --> 00:45:25.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it any coincidence
that we hear over and over again

00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:27.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the need for peace and for unity?

00:45:27.307 --> 00:45:28.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:30.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, as this world
gets more and more divided,

00:45:30.878 --> 00:45:33.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
fragmented, fighting,

00:45:33.313 --> 00:45:36.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to pull
tighter and tighter together in unity.

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that requires that all of us

00:45:38.852 --> 00:45:40.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
work on these beautiful qualities

00:45:40.854 --> 00:45:44.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
of humility, mildness, and patience.

00:45:44.391 --> 00:45:46.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when there’s a lack of unity,
what do we have to do?

00:45:46.894 --> 00:45:48.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have to look at ourselves.

00:45:48.629 --> 00:45:51.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, generally we find

00:45:51.131 --> 00:45:54.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the problem is me; it’s us.

00:45:54.735 --> 00:45:58.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we weren’t consulted
as soon as we should have been.

00:45:58.772 --> 00:46:02.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe our idea of how the work
or this thing should be done

00:46:02.976 --> 00:46:04.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
wasn’t shared by others.

00:46:04.978 --> 00:46:08.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the grand scheme of things,
does it really make a difference?

00:46:08.882 --> 00:46:11.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many times
when we look at a situation afterward

00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:13.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we pull back unemotionally,

00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:17.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
we generally find that, well,
maybe our idea was pretty good,

00:46:17.524 --> 00:46:19.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the timing wasn’t good.

00:46:19.827 --> 00:46:22.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe it wasn’t
that great of an idea after all.

00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:26.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe there was more than one way
for this thing to be handled.

00:46:26.767 --> 00:46:29.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps Jehovah’s spirit

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
was leading things in a different direction.

00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:37.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, again, what can help us
to not be an obstacle to unity?

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:39.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility, mildness, patience

00:46:39.246 --> 00:46:42.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just what we were considering
in Ephesians chapter 4.

00:46:42.583 --> 00:46:44.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, we have to have the confidence

00:46:44.618 --> 00:46:48.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if it’s important to Jehovah,
it’ll happen.

00:46:48.388 --> 00:46:50.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if not, what a shame it would be

00:46:50.591 --> 00:46:53.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we become an obstacle to unity

00:46:53.293 --> 00:46:57.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
over something
that’s not that important to Jehovah!

00:46:57.164 --> 00:47:01.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, brothers and sisters,
we need the “Gideons”

00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:04.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us
in our support of the Governing Body.

00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:06.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon was such a beautiful example.

00:47:06.773 --> 00:47:09.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once he understood Jehovah’s direction,

00:47:09.476 --> 00:47:14.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was willing to run into the fire
for Jehovah and for his organization.

00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:16.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we need.
We need “Gideons.”

00:47:16.617 --> 00:47:19.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t need any more “Ephraimites.”

00:47:19.453 --> 00:47:21.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in harmony with today’s text,

00:47:21.855 --> 00:47:25.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
may each one of us walk worthily
in these last days

00:47:25.592 --> 00:47:29.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and work on the qualities
of humility, mildness, and patience.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:34.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we do,
we will be a uniting force for good

00:47:34.334 --> 00:47:38.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of Gideonlike value
to Jehovah and the organization

00:47:38.572 --> 00:47:40.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the troublesome days ahead.

00:47:41.975 --> 00:47:46.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re humble
and add to the peace of the congregation,

00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:48.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
we make Jehovah happy.

00:47:49.316 --> 00:47:51.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:47:51.318 --> 00:47:55.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
we cherish our privilege
to share the good news with others.

00:47:55.889 --> 00:47:59.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us
be adaptable in our ministry?

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the latest installment

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:05.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Iron Sharpens Iron.</i>

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, I am Michalis,
and this is <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.”</i>

00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:24.184 line:10% position:50% align:center
One challenge that often makes me nervous

00:48:24.184 --> 00:48:26.520 line:10% position:50% align:center
is when I’ve prepared an introduction

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ve planned the conversation

00:48:28.555 --> 00:48:32.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the householder doesn’t follow the plan

00:48:32.125 --> 00:48:34.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have to adapt.

00:48:34.828 --> 00:48:37.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever had that experience?

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:41.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
This could mean
that what we prepared just won’t work.

00:48:42.803 --> 00:48:45.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we are going to discuss four tips

00:48:45.806 --> 00:48:48.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have helped me and hopefully

00:48:48.642 --> 00:48:51.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help you be more adaptable.

00:48:52.045 --> 00:48:54.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
The four tips are

00:48:54.214 --> 00:48:57.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) know your territory,

00:48:58.418 --> 00:49:02.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) make use of the Teaching Toolbox,

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) anticipate

00:49:06.526 --> 00:49:09.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
common objections or questions,

00:49:09.896 --> 00:49:12.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (4) be flexible

00:49:12.933 --> 00:49:15.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adjust to the householder’s needs,

00:49:15.902 --> 00:49:20.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
because remember,
this is meant to be a conversation,

00:49:20.107 --> 00:49:23.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
not a sermon or a sales pitch.

00:49:25.245 --> 00:49:27.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s look at a situation

00:49:27.414 --> 00:49:31.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
where applying
these four suggestions can help.

00:49:36.857 --> 00:49:38.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what introduction are you using?

00:49:38.959 --> 00:49:41.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought I would talk
about economic problems.

00:49:41.962 --> 00:49:43.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm.
Good idea!

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:44.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really suits the territory.

00:49:44.898 --> 00:49:46.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:49:46.199 --> 00:49:51.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll read Isaiah 65:21-23
and then offer the <i>Kingdom</i>  tract.

00:49:51.204 --> 00:49:52.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perfect.

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:53.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll get the scripture ready.

00:49:54.207 --> 00:49:55.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:50:06.253 --> 00:50:07.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:12.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people in our area
struggle to make ends meet.

00:50:12.125 --> 00:50:14.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think there will ever be a time

00:50:14.161 --> 00:50:16.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we won’t have to stress about money?

00:50:16.797 --> 00:50:19.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, now isn’t a good time.

00:50:19.666 --> 00:50:21.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just received some bad news.

00:50:22.636 --> 00:50:24.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:50:24.337 --> 00:50:26.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll come back another time then.

00:50:26.573 --> 00:50:27.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:50:32.846 --> 00:50:34.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:38.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister applied
our first two tips really well.

00:50:38.852 --> 00:50:42.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our sisters are usually excellent
when it comes to the ministry

00:50:42.823 --> 00:50:45.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
so no real surprises there.

00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:47.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice?

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, she knew her territory well

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:55.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had a presentation
designed specifically for it.

00:50:55.602 --> 00:50:59.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, her scripture and talking point

00:50:59.106 --> 00:51:03.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
were taken from the tract
<i>What Is the Kingdom of God?,</i>

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:07.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
which, as you know,
is part of our Teaching Toolbox.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:12.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when the householder
had something else on her mind,

00:51:12.052 --> 00:51:15.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
our sister opted to return later.

00:51:15.622 --> 00:51:19.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
That could be a good decision
in this kind of situation,

00:51:19.893 --> 00:51:22.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
but let’s see what would happen

00:51:22.696 --> 00:51:25.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
if she were to ask just one more question

00:51:25.866 --> 00:51:29.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adapt according
to the householder’s response.

00:51:31.905 --> 00:51:34.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, now isn’t a good time.

00:51:34.708 --> 00:51:37.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just received some bad news.

00:51:37.878 --> 00:51:39.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:51:42.482 --> 00:51:43.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:48.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
I, uh, I- I just heard
that my sister has cancer.

00:51:48.989 --> 00:51:52.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, that must be so difficult

00:51:52.425 --> 00:51:53.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your sister

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for you!

00:51:56.062 --> 00:51:59.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, when someone we love is suffering,
we can often feel helpless.

00:51:59.266 --> 00:52:01.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s exactly how I feel.

00:52:01.268 --> 00:52:02.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have a moment,

00:52:02.702 --> 00:52:05.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
could I show you something
that I find comforting

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:09.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a time in the near future
when our loved ones will never suffer again?

00:52:09.709 --> 00:52:11.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I’d like that.

00:52:11.111 --> 00:52:13.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what the Bible says

00:52:13.413 --> 00:52:17.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Revelation 21:3, 4:

00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:20.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that I heard a loud voice
from the throne say . . .”

00:52:24.357 --> 00:52:26.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:52:26.193 --> 00:52:30.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how she was able
to offer this woman real comfort

00:52:30.797 --> 00:52:33.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
just by being adaptable?

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:37.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
All it took was one simple question,

00:52:37.437 --> 00:52:40.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:52:40.207 --> 00:52:44.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was sincere and friendly,
and the householder responded.

00:52:44.978 --> 00:52:49.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point,
our sister applied our third tip.

00:52:49.249 --> 00:52:53.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
She obviously was familiar
with some common anxieties

00:52:53.286 --> 00:52:55.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
of ones in that territory

00:52:55.455 --> 00:52:58.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she smoothly transitioned

00:52:58.091 --> 00:53:02.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the topic of suffering,
which allowed her to listen

00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:05.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the householder’s real concern

00:53:05.498 --> 00:53:09.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then implement our fourth tip.

00:53:09.502 --> 00:53:12.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
She adjusted to meet those needs.

00:53:12.906 --> 00:53:16.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Plus, she didn’t struggle
to find information to use.

00:53:16.643 --> 00:53:20.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
She stayed right there
in her Teaching Toolbox.

00:53:21.481 --> 00:53:25.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Granted, not every situation
will be as straightforward as this,

00:53:25.685 --> 00:53:27.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it takes time and experience

00:53:27.988 --> 00:53:31.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get comfortable moving
from one topic to another.

00:53:31.925 --> 00:53:34.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we apply our four tips:

00:53:34.828 --> 00:53:37.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
know your territory,

00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:41.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
make use of the Teaching Toolbox,

00:53:41.368 --> 00:53:45.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
try to anticipate
common objections or questions,

00:53:45.372 --> 00:53:48.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then adjust to the householder’s needs,

00:53:48.942 --> 00:53:50.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
by applying these,

00:53:50.944 --> 00:53:55.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll find very quickly
that we are having meaningful conversations

00:53:55.548 --> 00:53:58.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are able to share targeted truths

00:53:58.652 --> 00:54:01.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those most in need.

00:54:02.689 --> 00:54:06.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
As always, these are just a few techniques

00:54:06.126 --> 00:54:08.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have worked for me,

00:54:08.528 --> 00:54:11.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I hope they work for you.

00:54:11.231 --> 00:54:15.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, part of the beauty of our ministry

00:54:15.468 --> 00:54:19.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we continue to sharpen one another.

00:54:21.174 --> 00:54:23.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
What good suggestions! 

00:54:23.843 --> 00:54:28.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this example,
the sister was able to start a conversation

00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:31.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a simple “good morning.”

00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:35.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, in real life,
the way you greet people in your territory

00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:38.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be different
than what we saw in the video.

00:54:39.993 --> 00:54:42.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you’ve enjoyed this month’s theme,

00:54:42.662 --> 00:54:45.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Make Wise Decisions.”

00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:47.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we conclude,

00:54:47.367 --> 00:54:50.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’d like to introduce you
to our brothers and sisters

00:54:50.503 --> 00:54:53.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
living in a land rich in Bible history

00:54:53.773 --> 00:54:55.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Greece!

00:54:55.775 --> 00:54:58.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greece is a mountainous country,

00:54:58.278 --> 00:55:01.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
located at the southernmost part

00:55:01.181 --> 00:55:02.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Balkan peninsula,

00:55:02.749 --> 00:55:05.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a rugged and diverse landscape.

00:55:05.552 --> 00:55:09.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also includes more than 2,000 islands.

00:55:09.255 --> 00:55:12.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with one of the longest coastlines

00:55:12.959 --> 00:55:16.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of Europe,
this is a land of beautiful beaches

00:55:16.696 --> 00:55:19.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sheltered coves.

00:55:19.766 --> 00:55:24.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greece is known for its classic
Mediterranean cuisine and delicacies

00:55:24.804 --> 00:55:29.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
like <i>moussaka,</i> made from eggplant,

00:55:29.142 --> 00:55:32.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and <i>dolmadakia,</i> stuffed grape leaves

00:55:32.445 --> 00:55:35.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
usually filled with rice and herbs.

00:55:35.015 --> 00:55:38.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
A less familiar part of the Greek diet

00:55:38.284 --> 00:55:41.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Chios mastiha,
or mastic gum,

00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:44.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is made from the sap of a tree

00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:47.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
grown only on the small island of Chios.

00:55:47.627 --> 00:55:51.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
In ancient times,
people chewed mastic to freshen their breath;

00:55:51.698 --> 00:55:54.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was an early version of chewing gum.

00:55:54.968 --> 00:55:57.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, it’s typically used

00:55:57.604 --> 00:56:00.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
to flavor everything from bread to ice cream.

00:56:02.042 --> 00:56:06.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
The preaching of the good news in Greece
goes all the way back to the first century,

00:56:06.713 --> 00:56:08.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the apostle Paul

00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:10.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
first “[stepped] over into Macedonia.”

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:14.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
He landed in the seaport town of Neapolis,

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:17.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
known today as the city of Kavála.

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:20.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the preaching in Kavála

00:56:20.293 --> 00:56:23.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
is still going strong,
with four congregations

00:56:23.463 --> 00:56:26.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
busy with public witnessing

00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:28.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the city,
including at the harbor

00:56:28.935 --> 00:56:30.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at rest areas.

00:56:30.703 --> 00:56:32.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kavála’s old city

00:56:32.705 --> 00:56:34.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
is built on a hill,

00:56:34.441 --> 00:56:36.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
where brothers and sisters

00:56:36.576 --> 00:56:40.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
often climb many steep steps
to reach the homes in their territory.

00:56:41.548 --> 00:56:45.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch office in Greece
oversees the activity

00:56:45.718 --> 00:56:47.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
of more than 30,000 publishers,

00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:50.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
including 2,900

00:56:50.457 --> 00:56:53.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the neighboring island nation of Cyprus.

00:56:53.526 --> 00:56:58.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
They preach to a population
of about 11 million people,

00:56:58.231 --> 00:57:01.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
often in some of the very same cities

00:57:01.267 --> 00:57:03.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Paul preached in the first century,

00:57:03.403 --> 00:57:08.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Thessalonica,
or modern-day Thessaloníki;

00:57:08.441 --> 00:57:10.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beroea, or Véroia;

00:57:10.977 --> 00:57:13.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the capital city of Athens.

00:57:13.413 --> 00:57:17.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll end our visit to Greece
back in Macedonia,

00:57:17.617 --> 00:57:19.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
where our Greek brothers and sisters

00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:24.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their warmest greetings
from the Assembly Hall in Thessaloníki.

00:57:25.258 --> 00:57:29.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:57:29.062 --> 00:57:31.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
