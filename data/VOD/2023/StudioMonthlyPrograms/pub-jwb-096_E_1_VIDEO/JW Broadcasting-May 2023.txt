00:00:01 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:04 What’s in store for us this month?
00:00:08 If you’ve ever struggled with feelings of inadequacy,
00:00:11 you’ll relate to the experiences
00:00:13 of Francis, Diego, and Carla.
00:00:16 They’ll tell us how they came to appreciate
00:00:19 their valuable place in Jehovah’s congregation.
00:00:24 When tragedy strikes, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.
00:00:27 We’ll learn how a brother who struggled to care for his family’s spirituality
00:00:32 got the help he needed to regain his balance and his joy.
00:00:37 And in our new music video,
00:00:40 we’ll see how learning the truth brings true comfort
00:00:42 to those who draw close to Jehovah and his people.
00:00:47 This is JW Broadcasting for May 2023.
00:01:10 As Jehovah’s servants,
00:01:12 nothing brings us greater joy
00:01:14 than worshipping the true God.
00:01:17 But we are also human.
00:01:20 This means that from time to time,
00:01:22 any of us can—and probably will—
00:01:25 experience unsettling moments,
00:01:28 times when we question our worth.
00:01:31 For example,
00:01:33 have you ever wondered about your true value in Jehovah’s eyes?
00:01:38 Have you ever experienced moments of anxiety
00:01:41 about your place in his organization?
00:01:45 Or have you struggled with feelings of worthlessness?
00:01:49 Such thoughts can erode our joy,
00:01:53 and we might even begin to doubt our personal worth to Jehovah.
00:01:58 If that has happened to you, you’re not alone.
00:02:01 Centuries ago, the writer of Psalm 94 revealed
00:02:06 that he too was overwhelmed by anxieties.
00:02:10 Let’s read it together.
00:02:11 At Psalm 94:19,
00:02:15 the writer is addressing Jehovah:
00:02:19 “When anxieties overwhelmed me,
00:02:22 you comforted and soothed me.”
00:02:24 Now, notice the footnote on verse 19:
00:02:26 “disquieting thoughts.”
00:02:30 These can arise from factors such as guilt
00:02:34 over the fact that we cannot do more in the ministry
00:02:38 or in the congregation;
00:02:40 fear of the future, of being separated from the ones we know and love;
00:02:45 and despair from being overlooked,
00:02:48 feeling that we don’t really matter.
00:02:51 “Disquieting thoughts” are real
00:02:54 and can overwhelm us at times.
00:02:57 They can rob us of our inner peace and our sleep.
00:03:00 And if we’re not careful, they can even stifle our prayers,
00:03:05 damaging our relationship with Jehovah.
00:03:08 Nothing would make Satan happier.
00:03:11 We never want that to happen, especially now,
00:03:14 since this old world is so near to closing.
00:03:18 So, what can help us to soothe
00:03:21 these disquieting thoughts?
00:03:24 In this month’s broadcast, we will find the answer
00:03:27 in a heartwarming prophecy.
00:03:30 We hope that this inspired message
00:03:32 will provide a strong Scriptural basis to help you
00:03:36 to dispel any feelings of inadequacy.
00:03:40 Which prophecy?
00:03:42 Well, please open your Bible to Isaiah chapter 56.
00:03:46 Here we read of one of the most touching expressions
00:03:49 of Jehovah’s appreciation for two groups of people.
00:03:53 Both groups wanted to serve Jehovah,
00:03:56 but under the Mosaic Law, they were limited
00:03:59 or even disqualified from fully participating
00:04:03 in Jehovah’s arrangement for pure worship.
00:04:06 Who were they?
00:04:07 Let’s read Isaiah 56:3:
00:04:13 “The foreigner who joins himself to Jehovah
00:04:17 “should not say,
00:04:18 “‘Jehovah will surely separate me
00:04:21 “from his people.’
00:04:22 “And the eunuch should not say, ‘Look!
00:04:25 I am a dried-up tree.’”
00:04:28 Did you notice the two groups?
00:04:30 Foreigners, or non-Israelites,
00:04:33 and eunuchs, men who physically could not produce children.
00:04:38 They faced very difficult and possibly disheartening circumstances.
00:04:44 During Isaiah’s time, uncircumcised foreigners
00:04:48 were allowed to live in Israel,
00:04:50 but they had no permanent ties with the nation.
00:04:53 Because of their status, they could not eat the Passover meal,
00:04:58 and as a protection,
00:05:00 the Israelites were not to associate closely with them.
00:05:04 But many foreigners came to love Jehovah,
00:05:07 converted to pure worship,
00:05:09 and served Jehovah alongside his people.
00:05:13 They were called proselytes.
00:05:16 Nevertheless, even they could not fully become part of the nation of Israel.
00:05:23 How would you feel if you were a foreigner alive at that time?
00:05:28 Your biggest fear would be getting cut off from God’s people.
00:05:32 Might you have disquieting thoughts at times?
00:05:36 Consider the second group.
00:05:38 Isaiah mentioned eunuchs.
00:05:41 These were men who had their reproductive organs removed.
00:05:45 It was the custom of Eastern pagan nations
00:05:48 to make eunuchs out of some of the male children taken captive in war
00:05:53 and then assign them to serve as trusted officials
00:05:56 in royal courts or in other settings.
00:06:00 It appears that during the days of Isaiah,
00:06:03 some of these Gentile eunuchs learned about Jehovah, came to love him,
00:06:08 and decided to align themselves with Jehovah’s people.
00:06:13 These eunuchs enjoyed a measure of acceptance among Jehovah’s people,
00:06:18 and they had the privilege of worshipping Jehovah.
00:06:21 However, because they were eunuchs,
00:06:24 they could not become fully-fledged members of the congregation of Israel.
00:06:30 Plus, at that time and in that culture,
00:06:33 they suffered great humiliation in not being able to father children.
00:06:39 Do you think they experienced disquieting thoughts at times?
00:06:44 We know they did.
00:06:46 But Isaiah reveals something significant about this group.
00:06:51 Jehovah loved them!
00:06:53 In effect, Jehovah says to them:
00:06:56 “I know how you feel.
00:06:58 Now let me tell you how I feel about you.”
00:07:03 Let’s read Isaiah 56:4, 5:
00:07:10 “For this is what Jehovah says to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths
00:07:15 “and who choose what I delight in and who hold fast to my covenant:
00:07:19 “‘I will give to them in my house
00:07:22 “‘and within my walls
00:07:23 “‘a monument and a name,
00:07:26 “‘something better than sons and daughters.
00:07:28 “‘An everlasting name I will give them,
00:07:31 one that will not perish.’”
00:07:34 I will give them “something better than sons and daughters”
00:07:38 —“an everlasting name.”
00:07:41 Their physical limitations
00:07:43 did not diminish their value in the eyes of our loving God.
00:07:48 Because of their whole-souled obedience to him,
00:07:51 Jehovah would always remember them.
00:07:54 They would have an everlasting name,
00:07:57 “one that [would] not perish.”
00:08:00 Jehovah treasured these faithful ones so much
00:08:03 that he kept the memory of their service
00:08:05 “in [his] house and within [his] walls”
00:08:08 like “a monument,” so as to cherish them daily.
00:08:13 Imagine how those eunuchs felt now,
00:08:15 knowing that their God had something special reserved for them.
00:08:20 They knew Jehovah had heard their prayers.
00:08:23 They knew that their God felt compassion for them.
00:08:27 All those disquieting thoughts started to melt away.
00:08:31 Those comforting words started to heal their broken spirit.
00:08:36 But why did Jehovah make these promises to these two groups?
00:08:41 What did he see that others may not have?
00:08:45 We don’t have all the details, but we do have some.
00:08:49 They are revealed to us much later in time,
00:08:53 and they give us valuable clues.
00:08:56 For example, in the book of Nehemiah,
00:08:59 we are introduced to two foreigners
00:09:02 who were living among God’s people.
00:09:05 There’s a significant detail about their names.
00:09:09 Nehemiah 3:7 tells us that they were
00:09:13 “Melatiah the Gibeonite
00:09:16 and Jadon the Meronothite,”
00:09:19 who were of foreign descent.
00:09:22 Yet, their names tell a different story.
00:09:25 What do they mean?
00:09:27 Melatiah means “Jah Has Provided Escape.”
00:09:31 Jadon means “Jehovah Has Given Ear.”
00:09:36 How did they get those names?
00:09:38 These men were likely born in Babylon,
00:09:41 children of foreigners who joined in true worship in Israel
00:09:46 and who were later taken captive in 607 B.C.E.
00:09:51 The parents of these men were not natural Israelites.
00:09:55 However, the names they chose for their children
00:09:59 reflected their devotion and love for Jehovah’s name.
00:10:04 And the fact that these sons of non-Israelites
00:10:08 would want to share in rebuilding Jerusalem
00:10:11 shows how they themselves loved Jehovah.
00:10:16 How did Jehovah feel about these foreigners?
00:10:19 Notice his prophetic words as we continue on
00:10:23 at Isaiah 56:6, 7:
00:10:29 “As for the foreigners who join themselves to Jehovah to minister to him,
00:10:33 “to love the name of Jehovah and to be his servants,
00:10:37 “all those who keep the Sabbath and do not profane it
00:10:41 “and who hold fast to my covenant, I will also bring them
00:10:45 “to my holy mountain and make them rejoice
00:10:47 “inside my house of prayer.
00:10:50 “Their whole burnt offerings
00:10:51 “and their sacrifices
00:10:53 “will be accepted on my altar.
00:10:55 “For my house will be called
00:10:57 a house of prayer for all the peoples.”
00:11:00 Jehovah noticed that these foreigners
00:11:03 faithfully observed the laws of a covenant
00:11:06 that they could never be fully a part of.
00:11:09 In verses 6 and 7,
00:11:11 Jehovah was, in effect, inviting them into his home
00:11:16 —“a house of prayer for all the peoples”—
00:11:18 Jew and foreigner alike.
00:11:21 Hearing these words must have lifted their heavy hearts.
00:11:25 But Jehovah did more than just tell them how much he valued them.
00:11:29 He showed them.
00:11:31 How?
00:11:33 Among the foreigners who returned to the ruins of Jerusalem
00:11:36 in 537 B.C.E.
00:11:39 were a particular group of foreigners who had become proselytes.
00:11:44 And they included descendants of the Gibeonites,
00:11:47 a nation that had joined themselves to Israel
00:11:50 and served as “gatherers of wood and drawers of water
00:11:53 for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar.”
00:11:58 These descendants of the Gibeonites
00:12:00 had spent decades as captives in Babylon
00:12:03 for crimes they did not commit.
00:12:06 They had no land inheritance back in Israel; they were servants.
00:12:10 Yet, they traveled back to Israel
00:12:13 and helped rebuild the temple and the walls of Jerusalem.
00:12:17 What motivated them?
00:12:18 They loved Jehovah.
00:12:21 These descendants of Gibeon
00:12:23 expected nothing in return for their service,
00:12:27 but they did receive something quite unexpected.
00:12:31 After the Israelites received their apportioned land,
00:12:35 this group called the Nethinim,
00:12:37 who did not have a land inheritance,
00:12:39 were assigned a place to live.
00:12:42 Where would they be placed?
00:12:43 Outside the city?
00:12:45 In a slum?
00:12:46 In some abandoned part of forgotten Jerusalem?
00:12:49 No!
00:12:50 The Bible tells us that they were assigned to live in Ophel.
00:12:54 Now take a look at the map,
00:12:56 and see for yourself where Ophel is located
00:13:00 —right next to the temple!
00:13:03 Jehovah made these humble “gatherers of wood” his neighbors.
00:13:08 This underscores how much Jehovah loved and cherished these faithful foreigners
00:13:12 who, motivated by love,
00:13:14 did all they could to share in his worship.
00:13:18 What’s the lesson?
00:13:20 Both the eunuchs and the foreigners were limited
00:13:23 in what they could do in God’s service.
00:13:26 From a human standpoint, they were probably considered
00:13:30 less than ordinary, nothing special;
00:13:33 perhaps some even considered them outcasts.
00:13:37 That is not how Jehovah viewed them.
00:13:41 He knew each one by name,
00:13:43 he listened to their prayers,
00:13:46 and he viewed each individual as a precious gem.
00:13:50 Where man sees the ordinary,
00:13:53 our heavenly Father sees the extraordinary.
00:13:57 To illustrate:
00:13:58 What do you see here?
00:14:01 If you are thinking sand, you are right.
00:14:04 Sand is one of the most common substances on the earth.
00:14:08 To us, it typically looks bland and ordinary,
00:14:12 each particle identical to the next
00:14:15 —no color, no sparkle.
00:14:17 You never see someone show off a sand necklace or bracelet.
00:14:22 But what happens if you look at sand
00:14:25 under the microscope?
00:14:27 To the naked eye, all sand looks the same and is pretty dull.
00:14:32 But magnified a hundredfold or more,
00:14:35 each individual grain of sand reveals distinct beauty.
00:14:40 We see parts of shells and crystals,
00:14:42 all contrasting in shapes and colors.
00:14:45 There is a treasure trove in a handful of sand.
00:14:51 That is how Jehovah sees each of you.
00:14:55 Just as he saw the faithful foreigners and eunuchs
00:14:58 for the precious gems that they were,
00:15:01 he sees you too.
00:15:03 Yes, you who may be restricted by age,
00:15:07 health, physical stamina, emotions, or family responsibilities
00:15:12 from doing as much in some spiritual activities
00:15:15 as you would like to.
00:15:17 But those limitations do not define you.
00:15:22 Remember that in God’s eyes, your worth as a person
00:15:26 is not measured by how much you do
00:15:29 but, rather, how much you try.
00:15:32 With eternity and perfection in view,
00:15:35 Jehovah chooses to see, not your limitations,
00:15:39 but your potential.
00:15:41 When you serve Jehovah whole-souled
00:15:45 despite limited circumstances,
00:15:47 you sparkle in his eyes.
00:15:50 And because you shine so brightly in Jehovah’s heart,
00:15:54 he will always help you.
00:15:56 He will always cherish you.
00:15:59 Do you remember the faithful psalmist who wrote
00:16:01 about being overwhelmed by disquieting thoughts
00:16:05 at Psalm 94:19?
00:16:08 In the very next line, he tells Jehovah:
00:16:11 “You comforted and soothed me.”
00:16:14 By the way, who wrote that psalm?
00:16:17 We don’t know his name, but Jehovah does.
00:16:21 And he carefully preserved that unknown writer’s words
00:16:25 for thousands of years in the Bible.
00:16:29 Like the psalmist, the foreigner, the eunuch
00:16:32 —no matter the circumstances—
00:16:34 when you humbly serve Jehovah, when you try your best,
00:16:38 your work is never fruitless.
00:16:41 An everlasting name is reserved for each of you
00:16:44 because your heavenly Father cherishes you.
00:16:50 Even though we know Jehovah loves us,
00:16:53 at times we may wonder where we personally fit in the congregation,
00:16:58 especially if we can’t do as much as we used to.
00:17:02 In this video, note how three regular pioneers
00:17:06 came to appreciate their cherished place in Jehovah’s family
00:17:10 despite major changes in their lives.
00:17:28 Shortly after getting baptized,
00:17:31 I set the goal of becoming a regular pioneer.
00:17:35 Then I went to preach in an unassigned territory where Miskito is spoken.
00:17:41 After that, I started serving as a special pioneer.
00:17:46 And some time later,
00:17:47 I went to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:17:50 Some time ago, I began to suffer from kidney failure.
00:17:55 So it felt like I wasn’t doing anything anymore,
00:17:59 and I couldn’t go back in time.
00:18:03 I grew up in a Christian family.
00:18:05 My dad worked in the construction of the Bethel branch
00:18:08 and then served as a Bethelite for some time.
00:18:12 My mom was a regular pioneer when she was younger.
00:18:16 She also volunteered at Bethel,
00:18:20 and that’s how she met my dad.
00:18:22 Some years ago,
00:18:24 I started suffering from severe anxiety attacks,
00:18:27 and that really affected me in the congregation.
00:18:31 I started to compare myself to others,
00:18:33 and I did the same with my parents.
00:18:37 I felt I could never live up to their example.
00:18:42 I grew up in a family where I wasn’t made to feel—
00:18:47 I never really felt adequate.
00:18:51 I felt so worthless; I felt very alone.
00:18:56 When my health problems began,
00:18:59 I started comparing myself.
00:19:03 I began thinking about what I was able to do before
00:19:07 and about how my activity had gone down.
00:19:12 This Watchtower  study helped me to see
00:19:14 how some previous assignments
00:19:17 could help me to do things better in my current assignment.
00:19:23 That helped me to think about what I can do now.
00:19:27 I think this Watchtower  article came just at the right time.
00:19:33 I’ve learned that comparing myself to others is very damaging,
00:19:37 and it was bringing me down spiritually.
00:19:41 So now that I’ve set the goal to stop doing that,
00:19:44 I’ve seen good results.
00:19:46 I’ve had the chance to make good friends
00:19:49 with older brothers and sisters in the congregation.
00:19:54 And when some of them needed help and turned to me,
00:19:58 I was happy to help them, and that encouraged me a lot.
00:20:02 When I started going to the meetings,
00:20:06 I was somewhat afraid
00:20:08 I was going to be inadequate in the congregation.
00:20:16 Paragraph 20 of this Watchtower  study
00:20:19 helps me understand that I should
00:20:23 use the gifts that the congregation
00:20:25 and especially Jehovah have helped me to discover
00:20:29 to encourage the congregation.
00:20:33 For example,
00:20:35 having raised two children alone as a young, single mother
00:20:41 (being able to do that),
00:20:43 I could help others in the congregation who were going through the same experience.
00:20:49 I’ve set concrete goals for myself,
00:20:51 like helping to clean the Kingdom Hall.
00:20:55 Although it’s lighter work, it’s helped me tremendously.
00:21:01 It gives me a lot of joy to know that it’s for Jehovah.
00:21:05 Now I try to help out the congregation wherever I can.
00:21:10 Speaking to an audience might not be easy for me,
00:21:16 but Jehovah has helped me to carry out my assignments.
00:21:21 And that has helped me to realize my place in Jehovah’s congregation.
00:21:26 This has helped a lot in developing my self-esteem
00:21:30 —not to dwell on the past,
00:21:33 on the old feelings of inadequacy,
00:21:37 or dwell on the perfection that I used to demand from myself.
00:21:41 I discovered I have something good to give to the congregation.
00:21:47 The brothers need the good deeds that we’re able to do.
00:21:53 It gives me a lot of joy to see that I can help others overcome their trials,
00:22:00 and this really helps me understand that I do have a role in the congregation.
00:22:20 Did you see how Francis, Diego, and Carla
00:22:23 maintained their joy?
00:22:25 They prayerfully adjusted their viewpoint
00:22:28 and their spiritual routine.
00:22:31 Their stories remind us that sometimes
00:22:34 our circumstances change unexpectedly,
00:22:37 throwing us off balance.
00:22:39 Has that ever happened to you?
00:22:41 If so, pay close attention to this next dramatization.
00:23:03 Caring for the needs of my family
00:23:06 is a source of great joy.
00:23:16 That was the life that was.
00:23:23 One drunk driver
00:23:26 and my wife was gone.
00:23:29 Our two children had lost their loving mother.
00:23:38 The doctors were hopeful that my son
00:23:40 might regain the use of his legs,
00:23:43 but in the meantime,
00:23:46 we needed to adjust to this new situation.
00:23:51 My mum was such a support,
00:23:53 both emotionally and practically.
00:24:00 She helped with the children
00:24:02 while I went to work.
00:24:05 That way I was able to care for the family’s physical needs.
00:24:13 It wasn’t easy.
00:24:18 I don’t know what I would have done without her.
00:24:27 My fellow elders were loving and considerate too.
00:24:32 They offered to lighten some of my congregation responsibilities,
00:24:38 but I just wanted to keep busy.
00:24:41 I tried to keep on top of everything,
00:24:44 but spiritually things began to slip.
00:24:48 On more than one occasion,
00:24:50 I had to ask others to cover my meeting parts.
00:24:54 Hello.
00:24:55 Hi, Simon.
00:24:56 Oh, hi, Oliver.
00:24:58 I’m so sorry.
00:24:59 I’ve been held up at work again.
00:25:01 Could you cover the Treasures part for me tonight?
00:25:04 OK, no problem.
00:25:05 I’ll see what I can do.
00:25:06 Thank you.
00:25:11 I was just too tired to prepare for family worship,
00:25:19 and the results were obvious.
00:25:37 Everything seemed overwhelming.
00:25:40 Even the simple things
00:25:42 were a struggle.
00:25:47 The meeting was great.
00:25:51 But Dad, you missed Madison’s demonstration tonight.
00:26:02 I’m so sorry!
00:26:06 I had to work late.
00:26:08 Don’t worry, Dad.
00:26:12 Something had to give.
00:26:15 Maybe I needed to step aside as an elder.
00:26:19 I needed help.
00:26:21 So I reached out to a good friend, Simon.
00:26:26 I explained everything.
00:26:29 He really listened.
00:26:31 He empathized and commended me for my efforts
00:26:34 and then shared Philippians 1:10 with me.
00:26:38 “. . . that you may make sure of the more important things.”
00:26:43 Oliver, it’s especially during challenging times
00:26:47 that we need to ‘make sure of the important things,’
00:26:50 and the key to doing that is balance.
00:26:55 Come over here.
00:26:58 Simon used a simple illustration
00:27:01 that changed my perspective.
00:27:05 Just as a wheel can be out of balance,
00:27:08 a sudden change in our circumstances can put us out of balance.
00:27:14 But skilled mechanics
00:27:15 can use small weights to rebalance the wheel.
00:27:19 The machine told Simon
00:27:21 where to position the small weight so that the wheel could run smoothly again.
00:27:26 I got the point.
00:27:27 Regaining balance might not involve big changes
00:27:32 but just a few smaller ones.
00:27:34 I understand.
00:27:41 Balance comes when we exercise faith.
00:27:47 Hebrews 11:6 reminded me that Jehovah
00:27:50 is “the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.”
00:27:54 And James 3:17 says
00:27:56 “the wisdom from above is . . . reasonable.”
00:28:00 I realized that my family’s spiritual needs are one “of the more important things.”
00:28:06 And it’s OK to ask others for support.
00:28:17 Applying these Bible principles helped me regain my joy.
00:28:23 Our circumstances may change,
00:28:27 but our Christian priorities do not.
00:28:31 They keep us anchored to our living hope.
00:28:34 My mum— And we’ll be all together.
00:28:38 Thanks to Jehovah,
00:28:40 I was able to provide for my own
00:28:43 in the most important ways.
00:28:51 What helped Oliver deal with such overwhelming changes?
00:28:55 The loving help he got from his brothers and sisters.
00:28:59 The support we get from others can ‘comfort and soothe us,’
00:29:03 just like the psalmist said,
00:29:05 especially when the world around us makes us feel unwanted.
00:29:11 That’s been the case with some of our brothers and sisters in Africa
00:29:15 who deal with a condition known as albinism.
00:29:19 As you hear their stories,
00:29:21 notice how they came to feel not just accepted
00:29:25 but cherished in Jehovah’s eyes.
00:29:30 Well, my years in school were not easy.
00:29:35 Some would tease me,
00:29:37 others would laugh at me,
00:29:38 and still others would use
00:29:40 hurtful words toward me.
00:29:42 I felt unloved and not needed.
00:29:45 Sadly, my parents refused
00:29:48 to take me to school.
00:29:49 “The best you can do
00:29:50 “is to get rid of this child;
00:29:52 just throw her away.”
00:29:54 That is what my father
00:29:55 was told by his friend.
00:30:00 Prejudice against people with albinism can be very cruel.
00:30:04 Those who are targeted can be traumatized for life.
00:30:08 Albinism is a genetic disorder
00:30:10 in which ones eyes, skin, or hair have little or no pigmentation.
00:30:15 People with this condition struggle with vision problems.
00:30:18 Extreme sensitivity to sunlight
00:30:20 also puts them at a high risk for skin cancer.
00:30:24 Beyond the physical challenges,
00:30:26 they also have to deal with unwarranted social stigmas.
00:30:30 In some African countries,
00:30:32 people with albinism are even attacked or killed
00:30:35 by those involved in spiritistic rituals.
00:30:38 This leads them
00:30:39 to live in isolation.
00:30:41 Tasila used to cry often
00:30:43 and feel down,
00:30:45 but since she has learned the truth in the Bible,
00:30:47 she has found comfort.
00:30:50 What helped me to endure all these trials
00:30:53 was praying to Jehovah regularly
00:30:56 and reading his Word, the Bible.
00:30:58 The first scripture that touches me deeply
00:31:01 is Psalm 18:25.
00:31:05 This scripture touches my heart
00:31:07 —to know that if I continue being loyal and righteous,
00:31:11 Jehovah cannot forget
00:31:12 and he will also “act in loyalty” toward me.
00:31:15 James was the target of intense ridicule.
00:31:18 He isolated himself
00:31:20 and felt worthless.
00:31:23 The scripture I love the most is John 17:3.
00:31:30 When I read this scripture, I was very happy
00:31:34 because I realized that Jehovah values me,
00:31:36 or is concerned about me.
00:31:40 So this showed me that Jehovah loves me.
00:31:44 Judith has now spent 24 years in the full-time ministry.
00:31:48 As a young girl, she was the target of vicious ridicule.
00:31:53 She felt insecure and kept to herself.
00:31:56 Revelation 21:3, 4—
00:32:00 when I read this scripture, ah,
00:32:02 my faith is strengthened.
00:32:04 I feel very happy.
00:32:07 It’s only through diligent, daily Bible reading
00:32:10 and attending the meetings with our brothers
00:32:14 and going out in the ministry
00:32:17 —this makes me strong and fortifies my faith.
00:32:21 Jehovah’s people love and accept those who suffer from various conditions,
00:32:26 including albinism.
00:32:28 Tasila, James, and Judith
00:32:32 are among those who have experienced
00:32:34 that brotherly love and acceptance in Jehovah’s organization.
00:32:38 There is a big difference between how people of the world
00:32:40 and how the brothers view me.
00:32:49 The love they have shown me has helped me prove that really
00:32:52 this is a spiritual family.
00:32:55 When I am among my brothers and sisters,
00:32:58 I do not see any difference or think that I have different skin.
00:33:03 But I feel loved and happy.
00:33:07 I do not lack anything.
00:33:15 This is my spiritual family.
00:33:18 Whenever I am among brothers and sisters,
00:33:20 I feel happy and protected
00:33:27 because they show me true love.
00:33:31 Tasila serves as a zealous regular pioneer.
00:33:34 She has overcome illiteracy
00:33:36 and now knows how to cope with hostility and prejudice.
00:33:41 Despite all the negative things she faced in the past,
00:33:44 she’s now positive and cheerful
00:33:47 and has her life and hope firmly based on Jehovah’s promises.
00:33:52 James still has to deal with prejudiced people from time to time,
00:33:56 but he does not allow that to make him bitter.
00:33:59 Rather, he chooses to respond
00:34:01 in a kind manner.
00:34:05 Judith has experienced many disappointments in life,
00:34:08 but above all, she cherishes being one of Jehovah’s people.
00:34:14 This overwhelming, impartial love
00:34:16 shown by fellow brothers and sisters in the congregations
00:34:19 is a source of support and help
00:34:21 not only for individuals with albinism
00:34:24 but for anyone who struggles with a challenging physical condition
00:34:27 or disability.
00:34:29 Yes, “mere man sees what appears to the eyes,
00:34:33 but Jehovah sees into the heart.”
00:34:39 “Mere man sees what appears to the eyes,
00:34:42 but Jehovah sees into the heart.”
00:34:45 Those are the words found at 1 Samuel 16:7,
00:34:50 and it was one of the verses we saw on the chalkboard in the video.
00:34:55 Jehovah certainly saw into the hearts
00:34:57 of James, Tasila, and Judith
00:35:00 and reassured them  of His love through the congregation.
00:35:04 Jehovah will comfort us
00:35:06 if we draw close to him and our brothers.
00:35:10 That’s the topic of this month’s new music video.
00:35:14 It’s called Draw Close to Me.
00:35:17 Please watch and enjoy.
00:35:26 Feels like I’ve come home. I was lost until Jehovah took me in.
00:35:42 Once, I faced my fears alone. Now I share them all, all with him.
00:35:58 And he brings comfort to my life, Makes me feel that I belong.
00:36:13 He says: “Draw close to me, close to me, And I’ll draw close to you.
00:36:29 “I’ll help you see, help you see, The good that I see in you
00:36:43 If you draw close to me.”
00:37:00 When I’m feeling low And my heart begins to condemn me for my past,
00:37:16 Feels so hard to let it go. So I pray to God it won’t last.
00:37:31 And just to know Jehovah cares Lifts me up and gives me hope.
00:37:44 He says: “Draw close to me, close to me, And I’ll draw close to you.
00:38:00 “I’ll help you see, help you see, The good that I see in you
00:38:15 If you draw close to me.”
00:38:28 Before I ever knew his name, He saw the best in me.
00:38:43 And now he’s just a prayer away, My God eternally.
00:39:01 He says: “Draw close to me, close to me, And I’ll draw close to you.
00:39:17 “I’ll help you see, help you see, The good that I see in you
00:39:31 If you draw close to me.”
00:39:52 Did you catch the lyric in the song that said,
00:39:54 “He’s just a prayer away”?
00:39:56 Those are powerful words to remember when we’re faced with daunting tests.
00:40:01 Jehovah can give us not just comfort but also strength.
00:40:06 Notice how that’s highlighted in this talk by Brother Lett.
00:40:11 The theme for my discussion
00:40:13 is “Never Let Satan Intimidate You.”
00:40:17 To intimidate means to try to get someone
00:40:21 to do or not do something by bullying,
00:40:24 terrorizing, threatening them.
00:40:27 And of course, Satan is a god of intimidation.
00:40:30 That’s one way he tries to get people to do what he wants.
00:40:33 On the other hand, Jehovah always motivates by love.
00:40:36 The word “intimidate”
00:40:38 is found twice in the Study Bible  notes.
00:40:42 And the word “intimidated”
00:40:44 is found once in the main text of our Bible,
00:40:48 Deuteronomy 1:17,
00:40:50 where the judges who were to assist Moses were told:
00:40:54 ‘Do not be intimidated by men;
00:40:57 render impartial judgment.’
00:40:59 But now, even though these words
00:41:02 are not used so much in the Bible,
00:41:04 the idea is found many times.
00:41:07 As a few examples,
00:41:09 think of Goliath —who was nine and a half feet (2.9 m) tall—
00:41:13 trying to intimidate young David.
00:41:16 Remember what he said to him?
00:41:18 First Samuel chapter 17, he said:
00:41:21 “Just come to me, and I will give your flesh
00:41:25 to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.”
00:41:29 ‘Just come to me, little boy,
00:41:31 and I’ll feed your corpse to the buzzards and hyenas’
00:41:35 —big-time intimidation.
00:41:37 Or what about the Rabshakeh
00:41:40 in loud, fluent Hebrew trying to intimidate the Jews
00:41:43 in the time of Hezekiah
00:41:45 or Sanballat and Tobiah
00:41:47 trying to ridicule Nehemiah and the Jews for building the wall?
00:41:52 Or another example found in today’s Watchtower  comments
00:41:57 was that Nebuchadnezzar really tried to intimidate the three Hebrews
00:42:01 into worshiping an idol.
00:42:03 How did he do it?
00:42:05 Well, Daniel 3:1 says
00:42:07 he erected an immense image
00:42:10 almost 90 feet (27.4 m) tall and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide,
00:42:14 and that was intimidating in itself.
00:42:17 But then he assembled, according to verse 2,
00:42:20 a huge throng of people: “satraps, prefects, governors, advisers,”
00:42:25 etcetera, etcetera —an intimidating throng.
00:42:28 And then in verses 4-6,
00:42:30 he had it loudly proclaimed: ‘You are commanded, . . .
00:42:35 ‘when you hear the horn, the pipe, the zither, . . .
00:42:38 ‘you must fall down and worship this image.
00:42:41 ‘And anyone who does not do so immediately
00:42:45 will be thrown into the burning, fiery furnace.’
00:42:48 Very intimidating
00:42:50 —but those three Hebrews remained unintimidated.
00:42:55 But of course, Satan, as we said,
00:42:57 still tries to use intimidation today.
00:43:01 ‘If you don’t take this blood transfusion, you will surely die.’
00:43:05 ‘If you don’t accept this job
00:43:08 ‘(talking about a job that’ll damage you spiritually),
00:43:11 your family will starve.’
00:43:13 ‘Why won’t you smoke this cigarette?
00:43:15 Are you afraid? Are you chicken?’
00:43:17 ‘Why won’t you date this girl in your class who likes you?
00:43:21 Are you a homosexual?’
00:43:24 Today, Satan uses intimidation.
00:43:27 First Peter 5:8 says
00:43:29 that the Devil “walks about like a roaring lion.”
00:43:32 And often those roars take the form of intimidation
00:43:37 —kind of like the roars of a literal lion,
00:43:41 according to the Insight  book, are calculated to cause domestic animals
00:43:45 to stampede and break out of their protective enclosure.
00:43:50 But, now, here’s a question:
00:43:52 What lessons can we learn from those three Hebrews
00:43:57 that will help us to never let Satan intimidate us?
00:44:02 Well, here are a few lessons.
00:44:03 One: Never quit trusting Jehovah
00:44:07 with all your heart despite the roars of the Devil.
00:44:11 If you go to Daniel chapter 3,
00:44:13 notice how they put implicit trust in Jehovah
00:44:18 despite this intimidating situation
00:44:21 —chapter 3, verse 16:
00:44:24 “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
00:44:26 “answered the king: ‘O Nebuchadnezzar,
00:44:30 “‘we have no need to answer you in this matter.
00:44:33 “‘If it must be, our God whom we serve
00:44:36 “‘is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace, O king,
00:44:41 “‘and to rescue us from your hand.
00:44:43 “‘But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king,
00:44:48 “‘that we will not serve your gods
00:44:51 or worship the image of gold that you have set up.’”
00:44:55 See, they trusted Jehovah.
00:44:58 Now, here’s another lesson:
00:45:00 Holy spirit will help us remain calm
00:45:03 —not panic—
00:45:05 and give a good answer to our persecutors.
00:45:07 When you think about what we just read, the answer they gave
00:45:10 —amazing composure—
00:45:12 amazing answer they gave.
00:45:16 Obviously, holy spirit was working powerfully upon them.
00:45:19 And we’re promised the same will be true for us.
00:45:22 At Luke 12:11, 12, Jesus said:
00:45:25 “When they bring you in before public assemblies,
00:45:28 “government officials, and authorities,
00:45:31 “do not become anxious about . . . what you will say,
00:45:34 “for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour” what to say.
00:45:38 Now, here’s another lesson:
00:45:40 Jehovah can use his powerful angels
00:45:44 to rescue us from an intimidating situation.
00:45:48 In the case of the three Hebrews, they were rescued miraculously.
00:45:52 When the king looked into that furnace,
00:45:55 instead of seeing three men bound being cremated,
00:45:59 he saw four walking about freely,
00:46:03 the fourth obviously an angel.
00:46:05 Now, when they were brought out of that furnace,
00:46:08 Daniel 3:27 says they didn’t even have “the smell of fire.”
00:46:12 No hair of their body was singed.
00:46:15 Now, we’ve been in homes where people are smokers
00:46:17 and you pick up that smell of smoke very easily.
00:46:20 Talking about singeing your hair, hair singes very easily.
00:46:25 Some time back I tried to light a gas stove using a match.
00:46:30 I didn’t get the timing exactly right.
00:46:33 It blew back —burned about half the hairs off my arm.
00:46:37 But here, they didn’t have a hair singed, not even the smell of smoke.
00:46:41 Now, today, we don’t expect Jehovah’s angels
00:46:45 to deliver us miraculously.
00:46:48 But Jehovah can use them to maneuver circumstances.
00:46:52 So we find a job to provide for our family.
00:46:56 So we find a cooperative doctor who respects our stand on blood,
00:47:00 as just a couple of examples.
00:47:02 Or he may use the angels to strengthen us
00:47:05 to be faithful in the face of that fiery test.
00:47:09 Now, here’s another lesson we can learn:
00:47:11 Firm belief in the resurrection
00:47:14 can powerfully fortify us,
00:47:17 even if we’re threatened with death.
00:47:19 Undoubtedly, those three Hebrews knew Job’s words
00:47:23 of Job 14:13,
00:47:25 where Job asked Jehovah to conceal him in the grave,
00:47:28 set a time limit,
00:47:30 and then remember him—resurrect him.
00:47:33 Likely, they were familiar with the resurrections of Elijah and Elisha.
00:47:37 Now, they didn’t know if they’d be miraculously delivered,
00:47:40 but they did know they would be resurrected if they kept their integrity.
00:47:45 The same is true with us today.
00:47:47 And that firm belief in the resurrection, if you think about it,
00:47:50 strips Satan of his power
00:47:54 to intimidate us even in the face of death.
00:47:57 You could say that hope is like our secret weapon.
00:48:01 Now, here’s one more lesson we can learn:
00:48:03 Remaining staunchly unintimidated
00:48:07 will give a powerful witness to onlookers.
00:48:10 Do you remember what the king said
00:48:12 when they came out unharmed from that furnace?
00:48:15 He said: “Praised be the God of Shadrach,
00:48:19 “Meshach, and Abednego, . . .
00:48:21 “for there is no other god
00:48:24 who is able to rescue like this one.”
00:48:27 And think about this,
00:48:29 if Nebuchadnezzar and other Babylonian onlookers
00:48:33 are resurrected as part of “the unrighteous”
00:48:36 mentioned at Acts 24:15,
00:48:38 this experience will give them a head start in the new world
00:48:43 on taking a stand with Jehovah.
00:48:45 And think about even the men
00:48:47 who threw them into the furnace who died doing so.
00:48:50 Now, if they’re resurrected,
00:48:52 they’ll be told about what happened subsequent to their untimely death.
00:48:56 And undoubtedly, that will be an impetus
00:48:59 toward spiritual progress in the new world.
00:49:02 Well, the same is true today.
00:49:04 When we stand firm, unintimidated,
00:49:07 we give a powerful witness.
00:49:10 And there are many that are now in the truth
00:49:12 as a result of such a witness.
00:49:15 Well, there we have five
00:49:17 anti-intimidation lessons
00:49:21 we can learn from those three Hebrews.
00:49:23 In review: Never quit trusting Jehovah
00:49:26 despite the roars of the Devil.
00:49:29 Two: Holy spirit will help us remain calm,
00:49:32 not panic, and give a good answer.
00:49:34 Three: Jehovah can use his angels in various ways
00:49:39 to rescue us from intimidating circumstances.
00:49:42 And number four:
00:49:44 The resurrection hope will powerfully fortify us
00:49:47 not to be intimidated even in the face of death.
00:49:52 And number five: Remaining staunchly unintimidated
00:49:56 will give a profound witness to onlookers.
00:50:00 So may all of us, like those three Hebrews, be determined
00:50:05 to never let Satan intimidate us.
00:50:10 Jehovah promises to give all of us strength, including young ones.
00:50:15 Our young brother Elijah was just a teenager
00:50:18 when he faced a life-changing situation.
00:50:21 Here’s his story.
00:50:24 So how can we continue to be faithful in spite of our human weaknesses?
00:50:28 Growing up I had, like, absolutely no health problems at all.
00:50:33 And I loved playing basketball, and I enjoyed
00:50:37 my life in the congregation.
00:50:41 This was a kid who had
00:50:42 his whole life in front of him.
00:50:45 It was taken away in a moment.
00:50:50 In November of 2019, I was diagnosed
00:50:53 with a massive brain tumor.
00:50:57 I was saying, like: “Why me?
00:50:59 Did I do something wrong?”
00:51:01 I wanted to know why it had to happen now
00:51:04 at 16.
00:51:07 I’m close to 18
00:51:09 when I think is, like, the prime of my life.
00:51:15 The night before I was going to have surgery
00:51:17 was probably one of the scariest nights of my life.
00:51:20 So I wanted to be able to still do the things that I loved,
00:51:24 and I really just didn’t want my life to end.
00:51:29 The account of David
00:51:31 was one that was very prominent in my mind.
00:51:35 There were many times in his life when he had to fight foes
00:51:39 that were very scary and life-threatening,
00:51:41 and this situation I was dealing with was pretty scary and life-threatening,
00:51:46 but I knew Jehovah had my back.
00:51:51 We talked about getting the brothers from HLC there to talk
00:51:54 and to back us up with the alternatives on his card.
00:51:57 The doctor was impressed
00:51:59 when he asked Elijah if he had any questions,
00:52:02 and Elijah asked him a couple of questions about the procedure
00:52:05 and then also brought up the blood issue.
00:52:08 This showed the doctor
00:52:10 that this was a young man who had his own stand, his own convictions.
00:52:14 If Jehovah tells me that blood is sacred,
00:52:18 then I’m listening.
00:52:21 Elijah kept on reminding us
00:52:23 that even if he doesn’t wake up on this surgery bed,
00:52:27 no matter what happens, he’s still going to wake up,
00:52:29 whether it’s now or in the future in Paradise.
00:52:38 They finally came out
00:52:40 only to tell us that there was a complication.
00:52:46 Elijah fell into a coma,
00:52:49 and we were waiting on answers that the doctors weren’t able to give us.
00:52:54 It was roughly close to five months
00:52:59 that he was in a coma.
00:53:01 However, Jehovah kept providing
00:53:04 the friends, the support.
00:53:08 We kept getting texts telling us
00:53:10 just how many friends were praying for Elijah
00:53:14 and for all of us to get through this.
00:53:20 In the spring of 2020
00:53:22 is when I gradually began to wake up.
00:53:26 It’s way harder to move around as I used to
00:53:31 —super painful and hard.
00:53:33 I have ataxia as of right now temporarily in my right hand,
00:53:37 so I’m not able to perform certain activities
00:53:42 as well as I would like to.
00:53:48 In my heart, I love basketball
00:53:50 and I wish I could participate,
00:53:53 but knowing I can’t because of something I can’t control physically
00:53:58 is really hard on me.
00:54:01 Job was always a great example in the Bible to me.
00:54:04 I view him in a totally different light now
00:54:07 because he was also hit with a medical issue,
00:54:12 but he managed to maintain his faith,
00:54:15 and Jehovah eventually blessed Job for that.
00:54:18 Since the coma, Elijah’s zeal definitely hasn’t lessened.
00:54:21 If anything, it’s increased.
00:54:24 He gives a whole new meaning to widening out,
00:54:26 because we want to be as zealous
00:54:28 and as busy in the ministry as he is.
00:54:32 Elijah has not accomplished any of this in his own strength.
00:54:35 He very quickly will give credit to Jehovah
00:54:39 but also will give credit to his family for the amount of support that he’s received
00:54:42 and give credit to the brothers and sisters
00:54:44 for the support he’s received from them as well.
00:54:46 He’s been engaged in the field ministry,
00:54:48 and he’s been active in doing whatever assignments we give him
00:54:51 within the congregation.
00:54:53 We were able to appoint him as a ministerial servant.
00:54:56 He’s got all this support.
00:54:57 He knows that Jehovah is with him
00:54:59 and that in that sense Jehovah truly is at his right hand.
00:55:02 I know that we have a hope
00:55:04 that Jehovah has given us for the future of perfect life.
00:55:08 It gives me a goal and more of a motivation
00:55:10 to help everyone reach that goal and get there.
00:55:14 There’s light at the end of the tunnel,
00:55:17 so I thank Jehovah for that so much.
00:55:21 Elijah, you are a precious gem in Jehovah’s eyes!
00:55:27 Our whole program has highlighted that each one of us
00:55:30 has a special place in Jehovah’s beautiful family.
00:55:34 As part of the family, would you like to see the invitation video
00:55:38 for this year’s regional convention?
00:55:40 The theme is “Exercise Patience!”
00:55:46 When was the last time you lost your patience?
00:55:50 on the road?
00:55:52 at work?
00:55:54 or at home?
00:55:57 Our busy lives
00:55:58 make it difficult for us to be patient.
00:56:02 But to enjoy life,
00:56:04 we need patience more than ever
00:56:06 —even if it’s being tested.
00:56:09 But what does patience really mean?
00:56:13 Does it mean we just passively wait
00:56:15 for something to change?
00:56:18 And how can patience affect our daily life?
00:56:24 The 2023 “Exercise Patience”!
00:56:27 Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:56:29 will show you what true patience is,
00:56:32 why we need it,
00:56:35 and how it can improve our relationships with others.
00:56:43 God wants you to be happy.
00:56:46 And as our Creator,
00:56:47 he knows that exercising patience is vital.

00:57:01 Think of whom you can share this invitation video with
00:57:04 so that you pique their interest.
00:57:07 Hopefully they will attend with us.
00:57:09 Would you like to see a little more?
00:57:12 This year’s convention will also feature a two-part modern-day drama.
00:57:17 Now, we won’t give away the story line,
00:57:19 but here’s a preview to whet your appetite.
00:57:30 If Mom and Dad were alive,
00:57:32 they would be very proud of you.
00:57:36 You know what I’m thinking?
00:57:37 You could have more.
00:57:40 I’m talking about real security
00:57:42 for you and the family
00:57:44 —a government carpentry contract.
00:57:51 Radio 93.6:
00:57:53 As an update to our report from yesterday,
00:57:55 militia groups are threatening
00:57:57 to take over the capital.
00:57:59 Violence has been escalating in the area.
00:58:01 As you are aware,
00:58:03 the branch has recommended that we meet
00:58:05 and discuss the possibility
00:58:07 of civil unrest in our area.
00:58:09 There will always be rumors
00:58:11 surrounding the elections.
00:58:12 The safety of the congregation is the concern.
00:58:19 There’s no need to worry.
00:58:23 These are just threats, rumors.
00:58:25 There’s nothing to it.
00:58:29 We received direction from the branch.
00:58:32 Those brothers are so far away though.
00:58:35 I keep wondering
00:58:37 if they are being overly cautious.
00:58:41 Remember, Amani:
00:58:43 “Your strength
00:58:46 “will be in keeping calm
00:58:49 and showing trust.”
00:58:52 Wake up!
00:58:54 Wake up!
00:58:56 Are you still trusting these people to guide your life?
00:59:00 Father Jehovah,
00:59:02 please help me.
00:59:12 The Governing Body has approved
00:59:14 a new original song to conclude the convention.
00:59:18 I’m happy to announce that the song and lyrics
00:59:21 are now available for download on jw.org.
00:59:25 The Governing Body requests that everyone practice before the convention
00:59:30 so that unitedly we can sing out with all our hearts.
00:59:34 Some will need help to download the song.
00:59:37 Please keep them in mind and provide help as needed.
00:59:42 Perhaps you can even practice singing the song with them
00:59:45 in preparation for the convention.
00:59:48 As you can see, we have a lot to look forward to in the months ahead
00:59:53 —further evidence of how much Jehovah cherishes his people.
00:59:59 Now for this month’s video postcard,
01:00:02 let’s travel to the heart of the Mediterranean Sea
01:00:06 where we find the island nation of Malta.
01:00:10 Malta is made up of five small islands,
01:00:14 three of which are inhabited:
01:00:16 Malta, the largest;
01:00:18 Gozo; and tiny Comino,
01:00:22 which has an area of just one square mile,
01:00:25 or about three square kilometers.
01:00:28 These islands are known for their rocky coastlines
01:00:31 and steep limestone cliffs.
01:00:34 Malta’s location—with Italy to the north
01:00:38 and Africa to the south—
01:00:40 is reflected in its language.
01:00:42 Maltese is a blend of an Arabic dialect
01:00:45 spoken in North Africa and a Sicilian dialect of Italian.
01:00:50 Spoken Maltese sounds like Arabic,
01:00:54 but it’s written using a Latin alphabet.
01:00:56 Maltese and English
01:00:59 are the country’s two official languages.
01:01:02 The many harbors and beaches found throughout Malta
01:01:06 might bring to mind its one and only mention in the Bible.
01:01:09 It was along these shores that in 58 C.E.,
01:01:13 the apostle Paul was shipwrecked on his way to Rome.
01:01:16 The Bible says that the islanders showed Paul and his companions
01:01:21 “extraordinary kindness,”
01:01:24 and many of the Maltese people today have responded favorably to the good news.
01:01:29 In modern times, the preaching work was established here in the 1970’s.
01:01:34 There are 11 congregations in Malta,
01:01:36 with over 800 total publishers.
01:01:39 Many people on the islands have migrated
01:01:42 from parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Philippines,
01:01:46 so the congregations preach in eight different languages.
01:01:49 The brothers in Malta enjoy public witnessing throughout the islands,
01:01:53 including the Port of Valetta, where a Tagalog congregation
01:01:57 preaches to the many Filipinos who work on the ships that visit the harbor.
01:02:01 On the island of Gozo, there are two congregations
01:02:05 —one Maltese and the other English—
01:02:09 with a combined total of 112 publishers and 34 pioneers.
01:02:14 The Bethel family in Malta, along with the brothers and sisters in Gozo,
01:02:19 send their love to you all.
