00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:04.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:07.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s in store for us this month?

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:11.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve ever struggled
with feelings of inadequacy,

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:13.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll relate to the experiences

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:16.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Francis, Diego, and Carla.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ll tell us how they came to appreciate

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:22.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
their valuable place
in Jehovah’s congregation.

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:27.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
When tragedy strikes,
it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:32.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how a brother who struggled
to care for his family’s spirituality

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:36.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
got the help he needed
to regain his balance and his joy.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in our new music video,

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see how learning the truth
brings true comfort

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:46.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who draw close to Jehovah
and his people.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for May 2023.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.122 line:10% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s servants,

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:14.257 line:10% position:50% align:center
nothing brings us greater joy

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:17.360 line:10% position:50% align:center
than worshipping the true God.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.063 line:10% position:50% align:center
But we are also human.

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:22.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that from time to time,

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
any of us can—and probably will—

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:28.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
experience unsettling moments,

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:31.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
times when we question our worth.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:38.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
have you ever wondered
about your true value in Jehovah’s eyes?

00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:41.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever experienced moments of anxiety

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:45.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
about your place in his organization?

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:49.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or have you struggled
with feelings of worthlessness?

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such thoughts can erode our joy,

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:58.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we might even begin to doubt
our personal worth to Jehovah.

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:01.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that has happened to you,
you’re not alone.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Centuries ago,
the writer of Psalm 94 revealed

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:10.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he too was overwhelmed by anxieties.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it together.

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 94:19,

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:18.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
the writer is addressing Jehovah:

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:22.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
you comforted and soothed me.”

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:26.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice the footnote on verse 19:

00:02:26.863 --> 00:02:30.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
“disquieting thoughts.”

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
These can arise from factors such as guilt

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:38.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the fact that we cannot do more
in the ministry

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:40.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in the congregation;

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:45.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
fear of the future, of being separated
from the ones we know and love;

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:48.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
and despair from being overlooked,

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
feeling that we don’t really matter.

00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:54.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Disquieting thoughts” are real

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:57.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can overwhelm us at times.

00:02:57.026 --> 00:03:00.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can rob us of our inner peace
and our sleep.

00:03:00.897 --> 00:03:05.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we’re not careful,
they can even stifle our prayers,

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:08.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
damaging our relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:11.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing would make Satan happier.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never want that to happen, especially now,

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:18.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
since this old world is so near to closing.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can help us to soothe

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:24.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
these disquieting thoughts?

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:27.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s broadcast,
we will find the answer

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a heartwarming prophecy.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope that this inspired message

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:36.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
will provide a strong Scriptural basis
to help you

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:40.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dispel any feelings of inadequacy.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which prophecy?

00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:46.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, please open your Bible
to Isaiah chapter 56.

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:49.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we read
of one of the most touching expressions

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:53.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s appreciation
for two groups of people.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both groups wanted to serve Jehovah,

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:59.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
but under the Mosaic Law, they were limited

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even disqualified from fully participating

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s arrangement for pure worship.

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:07.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who were they?

00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:12.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Isaiah 56:3:

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The foreigner who joins himself to Jehovah

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“should not say,

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Jehovah will surely separate me

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:22.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from his people.’

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the eunuch should not say, ‘Look!

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am a dried-up tree.’”

00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:30.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice the two groups?

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:33.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Foreigners, or non-Israelites,

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:38.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eunuchs, men who physically
could not produce children.

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:43.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
They faced very difficult
and possibly disheartening circumstances.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:48.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
During Isaiah’s time,
uncircumcised foreigners

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
were allowed to live in Israel,

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:53.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they had no permanent ties
with the nation.

00:04:53.743 --> 00:04:58.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of their status,
they could not eat the Passover meal,

00:04:58.047 --> 00:05:00.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a protection,

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:04.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Israelites were not to associate closely
with them.

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:07.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
But many foreigners came to love Jehovah,

00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
converted to pure worship,

00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:13.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and served Jehovah alongside his people.

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were called proselytes.

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:21.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, even they could not fully
become part of the nation of Israel.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:28.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel
if you were a foreigner alive at that time?

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:32.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your biggest fear would be
getting cut off from God’s people.

00:05:32.782 --> 00:05:36.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Might you have disquieting thoughts at times?

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the second group.

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:41.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah mentioned eunuchs.

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:45.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
These were men
who had their reproductive organs removed.

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:48.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the custom of Eastern pagan nations

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:53.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make eunuchs out of some
of the male children taken captive in war

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:56.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then assign them
to serve as trusted officials

00:05:56.806 --> 00:06:00.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
in royal courts or in other settings.

00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:03.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
It appears that during the days of Isaiah,

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:08.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of these Gentile eunuchs
learned about Jehovah, came to love him,

00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:12.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decided to align themselves
with Jehovah’s people.

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:18.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
These eunuchs enjoyed a measure
of acceptance among Jehovah’s people,

00:06:18.227 --> 00:06:21.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had the privilege
of worshipping Jehovah.

00:06:21.397 --> 00:06:24.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, because they were eunuchs,

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:29.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
they could not become fully-fledged members
of the congregation of Israel.

00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:33.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Plus, at that time and in that culture,

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:38.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
they suffered great humiliation
in not being able to father children.

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:44.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think they experienced
disquieting thoughts at times?

00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:46.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know they did.

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:51.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Isaiah reveals something significant
about this group.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved them!

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:56.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, Jehovah says to them:

00:06:56.732 --> 00:06:58.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I know how you feel.

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:03.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let me tell you how I feel about you.”

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:08.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Isaiah 56:4, 5:

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:15.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this is what Jehovah says
to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths

00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and who choose what I delight in
and who hold fast to my covenant:

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will give to them in my house

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and within my walls

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:26.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘a monument and a name,

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:28.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘something better than sons and daughters.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘An everlasting name I will give them,

00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:34.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that will not perish.’”

00:07:34.837 --> 00:07:38.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will give them
“something better than sons and daughters”

00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:41.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“an everlasting name.”

00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their physical limitations

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:48.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not diminish their value
in the eyes of our loving God.

00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:51.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of their whole-souled obedience
to him,

00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:54.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would always remember them.

00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:57.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would have an everlasting name,

00:07:57.627 --> 00:08:00.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one that [would] not perish.”

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah treasured these faithful ones so much

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he kept the memory of their service

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in [his] house and within [his] walls”

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
like “a monument,”
so as to cherish them daily.

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:15.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how those eunuchs felt now,

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:20.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that their God
had something special reserved for them.

00:08:20.883 --> 00:08:23.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew Jehovah had heard their prayers.

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:27.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew that their God
felt compassion for them.

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:31.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
All those disquieting thoughts
started to melt away.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those comforting words
started to heal their broken spirit.

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:41.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why did Jehovah make these promises
to these two groups?

00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:45.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he see that others may not have?

00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:49.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t have all the details,
but we do have some.

00:08:49.478 --> 00:08:53.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are revealed to us much later in time,

00:08:53.082 --> 00:08:56.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they give us valuable clues.

00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:59.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in the book of Nehemiah,

00:08:59.822 --> 00:09:02.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are introduced to two foreigners

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:05.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were living among God’s people.

00:09:05.428 --> 00:09:09.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a significant detail
about their names.

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:13.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah 3:7 tells us that they were

00:09:13.402 --> 00:09:16.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Melatiah the Gibeonite

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:19.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jadon the Meronothite,”

00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were of foreign descent.

00:09:22.044 --> 00:09:25.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, their names tell a different story.

00:09:25.348 --> 00:09:27.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do they mean?

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Melatiah means “Jah Has Provided Escape.”

00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:36.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jadon means “Jehovah Has Given Ear.”

00:09:36.058 --> 00:09:38.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they get those names?

00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:41.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men were likely born in Babylon,

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:46.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
children of foreigners
who joined in true worship in Israel

00:09:46.469 --> 00:09:51.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who were later taken captive
in 607 B.C.E.

00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:55.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parents of these men
were not natural Israelites.

00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:59.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the names they chose
for their children

00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:03.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflected their devotion and love
for Jehovah’s name.

00:10:04.787 --> 00:10:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the fact
that these sons of non-Israelites

00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:11.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
would want to share in rebuilding Jerusalem

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:16.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows how they themselves loved Jehovah.

00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:19.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah feel about these foreigners?

00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice his prophetic words as we continue on

00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:27.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 56:6, 7:

00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As for the foreigners who join themselves
to Jehovah to minister to him,

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to love the name of Jehovah
and to be his servants,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all those who keep the Sabbath
and do not profane it

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and who hold fast to my covenant,
I will also bring them

00:10:45.027 --> 00:10:47.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to my holy mountain and make them rejoice

00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:50.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“inside my house of prayer.

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:51.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Their whole burnt offerings

00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:53.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and their sacrifices

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:55.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be accepted on my altar.

00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:57.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For my house will be called

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:00.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
a house of prayer for all the peoples.”

00:11:00.843 --> 00:11:03.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah noticed that these foreigners

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithfully observed the laws of a covenant

00:11:06.382 --> 00:11:09.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could never be fully a part of.

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verses 6 and 7,

00:11:11.287 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was, in effect,
inviting them into his home

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:18.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“a house of prayer for all the peoples”—

00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:21.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jew and foreigner alike.

00:11:21.697 --> 00:11:25.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hearing these words
must have lifted their heavy hearts.

00:11:25.334 --> 00:11:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah did more than just tell them
how much he valued them.

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:31.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed them.

00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:33.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:11:33.876 --> 00:11:36.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among the foreigners
who returned to the ruins of Jerusalem

00:11:36.712 --> 00:11:39.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 537 B.C.E.

00:11:39.382 --> 00:11:44.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
were a particular group of foreigners
who had become proselytes.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:47.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they included descendants
of the Gibeonites,

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
a nation that had joined themselves to Israel

00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:53.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and served as “gatherers of wood
and drawers of water

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:58.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar.”

00:11:58.033 --> 00:12:00.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
These descendants of the Gibeonites

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:03.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
had spent decades as captives in Babylon

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:06.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
for crimes they did not commit.

00:12:06.108 --> 00:12:10.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had no land inheritance back in Israel;
they were servants.

00:12:10.846 --> 00:12:13.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, they traveled back to Israel

00:12:13.015 --> 00:12:17.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped rebuild the temple
and the walls of Jerusalem.

00:12:17.052 --> 00:12:18.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
What motivated them?

00:12:18.921 --> 00:12:21.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
They loved Jehovah.

00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:23.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
These descendants of Gibeon

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:27.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
expected nothing in return for their service,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they did receive
something quite unexpected.

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:35.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the Israelites received
their apportioned land,

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
this group called the Nethinim,

00:12:37.473 --> 00:12:39.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
who did not have a land inheritance,

00:12:39.742 --> 00:12:42.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
were assigned a place to live.

00:12:42.044 --> 00:12:43.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where would they be placed?

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:45.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Outside the city?

00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:46.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a slum?

00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some abandoned part
of forgotten Jerusalem?

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:50.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible tells us
that they were assigned to live in Ophel.

00:12:54.924 --> 00:12:56.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now take a look at the map,

00:12:56.592 --> 00:13:00.496 line:10% position:50% align:center
and see for yourself where Ophel is located

00:13:00.496 --> 00:13:03.332 line:10% position:50% align:center
—right next to the temple!

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:08.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made these humble
“gatherers of wood” his neighbors.

00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:12.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
This underscores how much Jehovah loved
and cherished these faithful foreigners

00:13:12.441 --> 00:13:14.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
who, motivated by love,

00:13:14.677 --> 00:13:18.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
did all they could to share in his worship.

00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:20.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:13:20.516 --> 00:13:23.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both the eunuchs and the foreigners
were limited

00:13:23.552 --> 00:13:26.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what they could do in God’s service.

00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:30.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
From a human standpoint,
they were probably considered

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:33.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
less than ordinary, nothing special;

00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:37.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps some even considered them outcasts.

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:41.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is not how Jehovah viewed them.

00:13:41.136 --> 00:13:43.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew each one by name,

00:13:43.772 --> 00:13:46.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
he listened to their prayers,

00:13:46.308 --> 00:13:49.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he viewed each individual
as a precious gem.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where man sees the ordinary,

00:13:53.282 --> 00:13:57.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
our heavenly Father sees the extraordinary.

00:13:57.386 --> 00:13:58.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate:

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:01.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you see here?

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are thinking sand, you are right.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:08.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sand is one of the most common substances
on the earth.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
To us, it typically looks bland and ordinary,

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:15.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
each particle identical to the next

00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:17.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no color, no sparkle.

00:14:17.673 --> 00:14:22.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
You never see someone show off
a sand necklace or bracelet.

00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:25.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happens if you look at sand

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the microscope?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:32.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the naked eye, all sand looks the same
and is pretty dull.

00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:35.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
But magnified a hundredfold or more,

00:14:35.824 --> 00:14:40.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
each individual grain of sand
reveals distinct beauty.

00:14:40.262 --> 00:14:42.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see parts of shells and crystals,

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:45.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
all contrasting in shapes and colors.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:50.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a treasure trove
in a handful of sand.

00:14:51.106 --> 00:14:54.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how Jehovah sees each of you.

00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:58.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as he saw
the faithful foreigners and eunuchs

00:14:58.948 --> 00:15:01.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the precious gems that they were,

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
he sees you too.

00:15:03.552 --> 00:15:07.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you who may be restricted by age,

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:12.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
health, physical stamina, emotions,
or family responsibilities

00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:15.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
from doing as much
in some spiritual activities

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you would like to.

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:22.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
But those limitations do not define you.

00:15:22.137 --> 00:15:26.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that in God’s eyes,
your worth as a person

00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:29.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not measured by how much you do

00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:32.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, how much you try.

00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:35.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eternity and perfection in view,

00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:39.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah chooses to see, not your limitations,

00:15:39.655 --> 00:15:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
but your potential.

00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:45.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you serve Jehovah whole-souled

00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:47.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite limited circumstances,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
you sparkle in his eyes.

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:54.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because you shine so brightly
in Jehovah’s heart,

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will always help you.

00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:59.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will always cherish you.

00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:01.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
the faithful psalmist who wrote

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
about being overwhelmed
by disquieting thoughts

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:08.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 94:19?

00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:11.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the very next line, he tells Jehovah:

00:16:11.286 --> 00:16:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You comforted and soothed me.”

00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:17.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the way, who wrote that psalm?

00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:21.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know his name, but Jehovah does.

00:16:21.764 --> 00:16:25.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he carefully preserved
that unknown writer’s words

00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:27.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
for thousands of years in the Bible.

00:16:29.004 --> 00:16:32.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the psalmist, the foreigner, the eunuch

00:16:32.174 --> 00:16:34.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no matter the circumstances—

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:38.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you humbly serve Jehovah,
when you try your best,

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:41.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
your work is never fruitless.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
An everlasting name
is reserved for each of you

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
because your heavenly Father cherishes you.

00:16:50.826 --> 00:16:53.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though we know Jehovah loves us,

00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:58.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
at times we may wonder
where we personally fit in the congregation,

00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:01.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially if we can’t do
as much as we used to.

00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:06.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this video,
note how three regular pioneers

00:17:06.308 --> 00:17:10.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
came to appreciate
their cherished place in Jehovah’s family

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:14.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite major changes in their lives.

00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:31.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after getting baptized,

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:33.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
I set the goal of becoming a regular pioneer.

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I went to preach in an unassigned
territory where Miskito is spoken.

00:17:41.376 --> 00:17:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that,
I started serving as a special pioneer.

00:17:46.248 --> 00:17:47.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some time later,

00:17:47.683 --> 00:17:50.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went to the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:55.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time ago,
I began to suffer from kidney failure.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it felt like I wasn’t
doing anything anymore,

00:17:59.361 --> 00:18:01.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I couldn’t go back in time.

00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:05.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up in a Christian family.

00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:08.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad worked in the construction
of the Bethel branch

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then served as a Bethelite for some time.

00:18:12.374 --> 00:18:15.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom was a regular pioneer
when she was younger.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
She also volunteered at Bethel,

00:18:20.048 --> 00:18:22.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s how she met my dad.

00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:24.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some years ago,

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:27.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started suffering
from severe anxiety attacks,

00:18:27.456 --> 00:18:30.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that really affected me
in the congregation.

00:18:31.226 --> 00:18:33.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to compare myself to others,

00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:36.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I did the same with my parents.

00:18:37.466 --> 00:18:40.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt I could never
live up to their example.

00:18:42.404 --> 00:18:46.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up in a family
where I wasn’t made to feel—

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never really felt adequate.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt so worthless;
I felt very alone.

00:18:56.952 --> 00:18:59.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
When my health problems began,

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:01.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started comparing myself.

00:19:03.826 --> 00:19:07.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began thinking about what
I was able to do before

00:19:07.763 --> 00:19:10.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and about how my activity had gone down.

00:19:12.467 --> 00:19:14.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
This <i>Watchtower</i>  study helped me to see

00:19:14.469 --> 00:19:17.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
how some previous assignments

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:20.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
could help me to do things better
in my current assignment.

00:19:23.212 --> 00:19:25.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped me to think
about what I can do now.

00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:30.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think this <i>Watchtower </i> article
came just at the right time.

00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:37.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned that comparing
myself to others is very damaging,

00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:39.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was bringing me down spiritually.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now that I’ve set the goal
to stop doing that,

00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:46.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen good results.

00:19:46.969 --> 00:19:49.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve had the chance to make good friends

00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:51.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
with older brothers and sisters
in the congregation.

00:19:54.042 --> 00:19:56.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when some of them
needed help and turned to me,

00:19:58.046 --> 00:20:02.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was happy to help them,
and that encouraged me a lot.

00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:06.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I started going to the meetings,

00:20:06.188 --> 00:20:08.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was somewhat afraid

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:12.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was going to be inadequate
in the congregation.

00:20:16.665 --> 00:20:18.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paragraph 20 of this <i>Watchtower </i> study

00:20:19.902 --> 00:20:22.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps me understand that I should

00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:25.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
use the gifts that the congregation

00:20:25.574 --> 00:20:29.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially Jehovah
have helped me to discover

00:20:29.077 --> 00:20:31.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage the congregation.

00:20:33.682 --> 00:20:35.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:39.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
having raised two children
alone as a young, single mother

00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:43.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
(being able to do that),

00:20:43.692 --> 00:20:48.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could help others in the congregation
who were going through the same experience.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve set concrete goals for myself,

00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:53.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
like helping to clean the Kingdom Hall.

00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:58.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although it’s lighter work,
it’s helped me tremendously.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives me a lot of joy
to know that it’s for Jehovah.

00:21:05.747 --> 00:21:09.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I try to help out the congregation
wherever I can.

00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:14.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking to an audience
might not be easy for me,

00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:19.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah has helped me
to carry out my assignments.

00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:24.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that has helped me to realize
my place in Jehovah’s congregation.

00:21:26.902 --> 00:21:30.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has helped a lot
in developing my self-esteem

00:21:30.772 --> 00:21:33.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not to dwell on the past,

00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:37.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the old feelings of inadequacy,

00:21:37.112 --> 00:21:41.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
or dwell on the perfection
that I used to demand from myself.

00:21:41.616 --> 00:21:46.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
I discovered I have something good
to give to the congregation.

00:21:47.322 --> 00:21:50.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers need the good deeds
that we’re able to do.

00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:57.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives me a lot of joy to see
that I can help others overcome their trials,

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:05.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this really helps me understand
that I do have a role in the congregation.

00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:23.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how Francis, Diego, and Carla

00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:25.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
maintained their joy?

00:22:25.894 --> 00:22:28.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
They prayerfully adjusted their viewpoint

00:22:28.864 --> 00:22:31.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their spiritual routine.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their stories remind us that sometimes

00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:37.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
our circumstances change unexpectedly,

00:22:37.406 --> 00:22:39.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
throwing us off balance.

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:41.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has that ever happened to you?

00:22:41.743 --> 00:22:46.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, pay close attention
to this next dramatization.

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:06.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Caring for the needs of my family

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a source of great joy.

00:23:16.711 --> 00:23:20.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the life that was.

00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:24.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
One drunk driver

00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:29.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my wife was gone.

00:23:29.191 --> 00:23:33.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our two children
had lost their loving mother.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
The doctors were hopeful that my son

00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:43.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
might regain the use of his legs,

00:23:43.071 --> 00:23:45.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in the meantime,

00:23:46.808 --> 00:23:49.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
we needed to adjust to this new situation.

00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:53.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mum was such a support,

00:23:53.915 --> 00:23:58.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
both emotionally and practically.

00:24:00.422 --> 00:24:02.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
She helped with the children

00:24:02.657 --> 00:24:05.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
while I went to work.

00:24:05.227 --> 00:24:09.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way I was able
to care for the family’s physical needs.

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:15.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy.

00:24:18.273 --> 00:24:21.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know
what I would have done without her.

00:24:27.516 --> 00:24:32.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
My fellow elders
were loving and considerate too.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
They offered to lighten
some of my congregation responsibilities,

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I just wanted to keep busy.

00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:44.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to keep on top of everything,

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:48.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
but spiritually things began to slip.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
On more than one occasion,

00:24:50.372 --> 00:24:54.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to ask others
to cover my meeting parts.

00:24:54.109 --> 00:24:55.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Simon.

00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:58.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, hi, Oliver.

00:24:58.046 --> 00:24:59.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:24:59.447 --> 00:25:01.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been held up at work again.

00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:04.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you cover
the Treasures part for me tonight?

00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:05.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, no problem.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll see what I can do.

00:25:06.788 --> 00:25:07.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:14.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just too tired
to prepare for family worship,

00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:21.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the results were obvious.

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:40.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything seemed overwhelming.

00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:42.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even the simple things

00:25:42.324 --> 00:25:44.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
were a struggle.

00:25:47.896 --> 00:25:49.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
The meeting was great.

00:25:51.466 --> 00:25:55.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Dad,
you missed Madison’s demonstration tonight.

00:26:02.277 --> 00:26:04.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry!

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to work late.

00:26:08.883 --> 00:26:10.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry, Dad.

00:26:12.754 --> 00:26:15.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something had to give.

00:26:15.357 --> 00:26:19.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I needed to step aside as an elder.

00:26:19.594 --> 00:26:21.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed help.

00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:26.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I reached out to a good friend, Simon.

00:26:26.134 --> 00:26:28.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
I explained everything.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
He really listened.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
He empathized
and commended me for my efforts

00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:38.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then shared Philippians 1:10 with me.

00:26:38.847 --> 00:26:42.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“. . . that you may make sure
of the more important things.”

00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:47.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oliver,
it’s especially during challenging times

00:26:47.989 --> 00:26:50.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to ‘make sure
of the important things,’

00:26:50.825 --> 00:26:54.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the key to doing that is balance.

00:26:55.664 --> 00:26:57.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come over here.

00:26:58.633 --> 00:27:01.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simon used a simple illustration

00:27:01.236 --> 00:27:04.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
that changed my perspective.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as a wheel can be out of balance,

00:27:08.143 --> 00:27:12.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sudden change in our circumstances
can put us out of balance.

00:27:14.015 --> 00:27:15.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
But skilled mechanics

00:27:15.517 --> 00:27:19.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
can use small weights to rebalance the wheel.

00:27:19.821 --> 00:27:21.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
The machine told Simon

00:27:21.856 --> 00:27:25.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
where to position the small weight
so that the wheel could run smoothly again.

00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:27.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got the point.

00:27:27.862 --> 00:27:32.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regaining balance
might not involve big changes

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just a few smaller ones.

00:27:34.402 --> 00:27:35.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:44.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Balance comes when we exercise faith.

00:27:47.282 --> 00:27:50.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 11:6 reminded me that Jehovah

00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:53.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “the rewarder
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:56.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
And James 3:17 says

00:27:56.991 --> 00:27:59.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the wisdom from above is . . . reasonable.”

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:05.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that my family’s spiritual needs
are one “of the more important things.”

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:09.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s OK to ask others for support.

00:28:17.412 --> 00:28:22.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Applying these Bible principles
helped me regain my joy.

00:28:23.351 --> 00:28:26.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our circumstances may change,

00:28:27.922 --> 00:28:30.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our Christian priorities do not.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
They keep us anchored to our living hope.

00:28:34.329 --> 00:28:38.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mum—
And we’ll be all together.

00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:40.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to Jehovah,

00:28:40.435 --> 00:28:43.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to provide for my own

00:28:43.638 --> 00:28:46.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the most important ways.

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:55.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped Oliver
deal with such overwhelming changes?

00:28:55.717 --> 00:28:59.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
The loving help he got
from his brothers and sisters.

00:28:59.621 --> 00:29:03.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
The support we get
from others can ‘comfort and soothe us,’

00:29:03.758 --> 00:29:05.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like the psalmist said,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when the world around us
makes us feel unwanted.

00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:15.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s been the case with some
of our brothers and sisters in Africa

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
who deal with a condition known as albinism.

00:29:19.474 --> 00:29:21.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you hear their stories,

00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:25.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how they came
to feel not just accepted

00:29:25.113 --> 00:29:28.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
but cherished in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:29:30.418 --> 00:29:33.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, my years in school were not easy.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.125 line:10% position:50% align:center
Some would tease me,

00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:38.960 line:10% position:50% align:center
others would laugh at me,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.328 line:10% position:50% align:center
and still others would use

00:29:40.328 --> 00:29:42.030 line:10% position:50% align:center
hurtful words toward me.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.767 line:10% position:50% align:center
I felt unloved and not needed.

00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:48.036 line:10% position:50% align:center
Sadly, my parents refused

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:49.804 line:10% position:50% align:center
to take me to school.

00:29:49.804 --> 00:29:50.972 line:10% position:50% align:center
“The best you can do

00:29:50.972 --> 00:29:52.440 line:10% position:50% align:center
“is to get rid of this child;

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.108 line:10% position:50% align:center
just throw her away.”

00:29:54.108 --> 00:29:55.410 line:10% position:50% align:center
That is what my father

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.845 line:10% position:50% align:center
was told by his friend.

00:30:00.148 --> 00:30:03.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prejudice against people with albinism
can be very cruel.

00:30:04.285 --> 00:30:07.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who are targeted
can be traumatized for life.

00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:10.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Albinism is a genetic disorder

00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:14.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which ones eyes, skin, or hair
have little or no pigmentation.

00:30:15.697 --> 00:30:18.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
People with this condition
struggle with vision problems.

00:30:18.666 --> 00:30:20.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Extreme sensitivity to sunlight

00:30:20.802 --> 00:30:23.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
also puts them
at a high risk for skin cancer.

00:30:24.205 --> 00:30:26.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beyond the physical challenges,

00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:30.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
they also have to deal
with unwarranted social stigmas.

00:30:30.712 --> 00:30:32.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some African countries,

00:30:32.747 --> 00:30:35.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
people with albinism
are even attacked or killed

00:30:35.483 --> 00:30:38.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
by those involved in spiritistic rituals.

00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:39.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
This leads them

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:41.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live in isolation.

00:30:41.523 --> 00:30:43.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tasila used to cry often

00:30:43.291 --> 00:30:45.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel down,

00:30:45.827 --> 00:30:47.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since she has learned
the truth in the Bible,

00:30:47.996 --> 00:30:50.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
she has found comfort.

00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:53.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped me to endure all these trials

00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:56.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
was praying to Jehovah regularly

00:30:56.304 --> 00:30:58.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reading his Word, the Bible.

00:30:58.873 --> 00:31:01.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first scripture that touches me deeply

00:31:01.743 --> 00:31:04.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Psalm 18:25.

00:31:05.313 --> 00:31:07.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
This scripture touches my heart

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:11.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to know that if I continue
being loyal and righteous,

00:31:11.085 --> 00:31:12.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cannot forget

00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:15.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will also “act in loyalty” toward me.

00:31:15.857 --> 00:31:18.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
James was the target of intense ridicule.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
He isolated himself

00:31:20.728 --> 00:31:22.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
and felt worthless.

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:28.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture I love the most is John 17:3.

00:31:30.171 --> 00:31:32.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I read this scripture,
I was very happy

00:31:34.242 --> 00:31:36.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I realized that Jehovah values me,

00:31:36.878 --> 00:31:38.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
or is concerned about me.

00:31:40.248 --> 00:31:43.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this showed me that Jehovah loves me.

00:31:44.252 --> 00:31:47.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judith has now spent 24 years
in the full-time ministry.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:52.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a young girl,
she was the target of vicious ridicule.

00:31:53.094 --> 00:31:56.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
She felt insecure and kept to herself.

00:31:56.731 --> 00:32:00.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 21:3, 4—

00:32:00.034 --> 00:32:02.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I read this scripture, ah,

00:32:02.403 --> 00:32:04.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
my faith is strengthened.

00:32:04.138 --> 00:32:05.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel very happy.

00:32:07.041 --> 00:32:10.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s only through diligent,
daily Bible reading

00:32:10.378 --> 00:32:14.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and attending the meetings with our brothers

00:32:14.415 --> 00:32:16.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
and going out in the ministry

00:32:17.518 --> 00:32:20.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this makes me strong and fortifies my faith.

00:32:21.956 --> 00:32:26.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people love and accept
those who suffer from various conditions,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
including albinism.

00:32:28.596 --> 00:32:32.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tasila, James, and Judith

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
are among those who have experienced

00:32:34.068 --> 00:32:37.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
that brotherly love and acceptance
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:32:38.172 --> 00:32:40.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a big difference
between how people of the world

00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:42.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how the brothers view me.

00:32:49.183 --> 00:32:52.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
The love they have shown me
has helped me prove that really

00:32:52.854 --> 00:32:54.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is a spiritual family.

00:32:55.823 --> 00:32:58.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I am among my brothers and sisters,

00:32:58.726 --> 00:33:02.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not see any difference
or think that I have different skin.

00:33:03.765 --> 00:33:07.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I feel loved and happy.

00:33:07.001 --> 00:33:09.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not lack anything.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my spiritual family.

00:33:18.012 --> 00:33:20.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever I am among brothers and sisters,

00:33:20.948 --> 00:33:23.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel happy and protected

00:33:27.855 --> 00:33:29.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they show me true love.

00:33:31.025 --> 00:33:34.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tasila serves as a zealous regular pioneer.

00:33:34.495 --> 00:33:36.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
She has overcome illiteracy

00:33:36.698 --> 00:33:40.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now knows how to cope
with hostility and prejudice.

00:33:41.169 --> 00:33:44.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite all the negative things
she faced in the past,

00:33:44.238 --> 00:33:47.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s now positive and cheerful

00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:51.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has her life and hope
firmly based on Jehovah’s promises.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
James still has to deal
with prejudiced people from time to time,

00:33:56.384 --> 00:33:59.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he does not allow that
to make him bitter.

00:33:59.654 --> 00:34:01.889 line:10% position:50% align:center
Rather, he chooses to respond

00:34:01.889 --> 00:34:03.891 line:10% position:50% align:center
in a kind manner.

00:34:05.026 --> 00:34:07.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judith has experienced
many disappointments in life,

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:13.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
but above all, she cherishes being
one of Jehovah’s people.

00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:16.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
This overwhelming, impartial love

00:34:16.738 --> 00:34:19.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
shown by fellow brothers and sisters
in the congregations

00:34:19.574 --> 00:34:21.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a source of support and help

00:34:21.609 --> 00:34:24.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only for individuals with albinism

00:34:24.078 --> 00:34:27.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for anyone who struggles
with a challenging physical condition

00:34:27.749 --> 00:34:29.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
or disability.

00:34:29.617 --> 00:34:33.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, “mere man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:34:33.888 --> 00:34:37.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mere man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:34:42.697 --> 00:34:45.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are the words found at 1 Samuel 16:7,

00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:54.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was one of the verses
we saw on the chalkboard in the video.

00:34:55.143 --> 00:34:57.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah certainly saw into the hearts

00:34:57.478 --> 00:35:00.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
of James, Tasila, and Judith

00:35:00.948 --> 00:35:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reassured them 
of His love through the congregation.

00:35:04.886 --> 00:35:06.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will comfort us

00:35:06.888 --> 00:35:10.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we draw close to him and our brothers.

00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:14.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the topic
of this month’s new music video.

00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:17.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called <i>Draw Close to Me</i>.

00:35:17.431 --> 00:35:19.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please watch and enjoy.

00:35:26.774 --> 00:35:41.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feels like I’ve come home.
I was lost until Jehovah took me in.

00:35:42.857 --> 00:35:55.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once, I faced my fears alone.
Now I share them all, all with him.

00:35:58.072 --> 00:36:11.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he brings comfort to my life,
Makes me feel that I belong.

00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:28.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Draw close to me, close to me,
And I’ll draw close to you.

00:36:29.337 --> 00:36:43.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ll help you see, help you see,
The good that I see in you

00:36:43.584 --> 00:36:53.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you draw close to me.”

00:37:00.434 --> 00:37:15.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I’m feeling low
And my heart begins to condemn me for my past,

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:28.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feels so hard to let it go.
So I pray to God it won’t last.

00:37:31.299 --> 00:37:43.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just to know Jehovah cares
Lifts me up and gives me hope.

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:59.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Draw close to me, close to me,
And I’ll draw close to you.

00:38:00.094 --> 00:38:15.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ll help you see, help you see,
The good that I see in you

00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:26.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you draw close to me.”

00:38:28.522 --> 00:38:41.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I ever knew his name,
He saw the best in me.

00:38:43.471 --> 00:39:00.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now he’s just a prayer away,
My God eternally.

00:39:01.355 --> 00:39:15.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Draw close to me, close to me,
And I’ll draw close to you.

00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:31.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ll help you see, help you see,
The good that I see in you

00:39:31.685 --> 00:39:42.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you draw close to me.”

00:39:52.039 --> 00:39:54.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you catch the lyric
in the song that said,

00:39:54.742 --> 00:39:56.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He’s just a prayer away”?

00:39:56.911 --> 00:40:01.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are powerful words to remember
when we’re faced with daunting tests.

00:40:01.882 --> 00:40:06.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can give us
not just comfort but also strength.

00:40:06.454 --> 00:40:10.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how that’s highlighted
in this talk by Brother Lett.

00:40:11.058 --> 00:40:13.060 line:10% position:50% align:center
The theme for my discussion

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.598 line:10% position:50% align:center
is “Never Let Satan Intimidate You.”

00:40:17.598 --> 00:40:21.035 line:10% position:50% align:center
To intimidate means to try to get someone

00:40:21.035 --> 00:40:24.638 line:10% position:50% align:center
to do or not do something by bullying,

00:40:24.638 --> 00:40:27.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
terrorizing, threatening them.

00:40:27.374 --> 00:40:30.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of course,
Satan is a god of intimidation.

00:40:30.377 --> 00:40:33.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s one way he tries
to get people to do what he wants.

00:40:33.447 --> 00:40:36.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
Jehovah always motivates by love.

00:40:36.884 --> 00:40:38.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “intimidate”

00:40:38.986 --> 00:40:42.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
is found twice in the <i>Study Bible </i> notes.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the word “intimidated”

00:40:44.492 --> 00:40:48.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
is found once in the main text of our Bible,

00:40:48.195 --> 00:40:50.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 1:17,

00:40:50.431 --> 00:40:54.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the judges
who were to assist Moses were told:

00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:57.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do not be intimidated by men;

00:40:57.304 --> 00:40:59.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
render impartial judgment.’

00:40:59.673 --> 00:41:02.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, even though these words

00:41:02.543 --> 00:41:04.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not used so much in the Bible,

00:41:04.812 --> 00:41:07.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
the idea is found many times.

00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:09.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a few examples,

00:41:09.917 --> 00:41:13.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
think of Goliath
—who was nine and a half feet (2.9 m) tall—

00:41:13.187 --> 00:41:16.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to intimidate young David.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what he said to him?

00:41:18.192 --> 00:41:21.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Samuel chapter 17, he said:

00:41:21.195 --> 00:41:25.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just come to me,
and I will give your flesh

00:41:25.166 --> 00:41:29.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the birds of the heavens
and to the beasts of the field.”

00:41:29.103 --> 00:41:31.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Just come to me, little boy,

00:41:31.138 --> 00:41:35.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ll feed your corpse
to the buzzards and hyenas’

00:41:35.176 --> 00:41:37.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
—big-time intimidation.

00:41:37.711 --> 00:41:40.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or what about the Rabshakeh

00:41:40.047 --> 00:41:43.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
in loud, fluent Hebrew
trying to intimidate the Jews

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the time of Hezekiah

00:41:45.452 --> 00:41:47.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
or Sanballat and Tobiah

00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:52.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to ridicule Nehemiah and the Jews
for building the wall?

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:57.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or another example
found in today’s <i>Watchtower </i> comments

00:41:57.264 --> 00:42:01.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that Nebuchadnezzar
really tried to intimidate the three Hebrews

00:42:01.502 --> 00:42:03.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
into worshiping an idol.

00:42:03.504 --> 00:42:05.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he do it?

00:42:05.005 --> 00:42:07.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Daniel 3:1 says

00:42:07.575 --> 00:42:10.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
he erected an immense image

00:42:10.945 --> 00:42:14.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
almost 90 feet (27.4 m) tall
and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide,

00:42:14.415 --> 00:42:17.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was intimidating in itself.

00:42:17.384 --> 00:42:20.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he assembled, according to verse 2,

00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:25.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
a huge throng of people:
“satraps, prefects, governors, advisers,”

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:28.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
etcetera, etcetera
—an intimidating throng.

00:42:28.596 --> 00:42:30.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verses 4-6,

00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:35.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had it loudly proclaimed:
‘You are commanded, . . .

00:42:35.202 --> 00:42:38.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when you hear the horn,
the pipe, the zither, . . .

00:42:38.205 --> 00:42:41.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘you must fall down and worship this image.

00:42:41.175 --> 00:42:45.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And anyone who does not do so immediately

00:42:45.112 --> 00:42:48.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be thrown
into the burning, fiery furnace.’

00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:50.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very intimidating

00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:55.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but those three Hebrews
remained unintimidated.

00:42:55.322 --> 00:42:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
But of course, Satan, as we said,

00:42:57.925 --> 00:43:01.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
still tries to use intimidation today.

00:43:01.128 --> 00:43:05.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If you don’t take this blood transfusion,
you will surely die.’

00:43:05.933 --> 00:43:08.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If you don’t accept this job

00:43:08.102 --> 00:43:11.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘(talking about a job
that’ll damage you spiritually),

00:43:11.405 --> 00:43:13.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
your family will starve.’

00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:15.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why won’t you smoke this cigarette?

00:43:15.876 --> 00:43:17.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you afraid?
Are you chicken?’

00:43:17.911 --> 00:43:21.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why won’t you date
this girl in your class who likes you?

00:43:21.915 --> 00:43:24.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a homosexual?’

00:43:24.151 --> 00:43:27.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Satan uses intimidation.

00:43:27.821 --> 00:43:29.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 5:8 says

00:43:29.823 --> 00:43:32.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Devil
“walks about like a roaring lion.”

00:43:32.826 --> 00:43:37.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
And often those roars
take the form of intimidation

00:43:37.831 --> 00:43:41.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
—kind of like the roars of a literal lion,

00:43:41.669 --> 00:43:45.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the <i>Insight </i> book,
are calculated to cause domestic animals

00:43:45.973 --> 00:43:50.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stampede and break out
of their protective enclosure.

00:43:50.644 --> 00:43:52.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now, here’s a question:

00:43:52.846 --> 00:43:57.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons can we learn
from those three Hebrews

00:43:57.851 --> 00:44:02.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us
to never let Satan intimidate us?

00:44:02.189 --> 00:44:03.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here are a few lessons.

00:44:03.991 --> 00:44:07.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
One: Never quit trusting Jehovah

00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:11.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all your heart
despite the roars of the Devil.

00:44:11.298 --> 00:44:13.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you go to Daniel chapter 3,

00:44:13.967 --> 00:44:18.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how they put implicit trust in Jehovah

00:44:18.505 --> 00:44:21.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite this intimidating situation

00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:24.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
—chapter 3, verse 16:

00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:26.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“answered the king: ‘O Nebuchadnezzar,

00:44:30.617 --> 00:44:33.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘we have no need
to answer you in this matter.

00:44:33.821 --> 00:44:36.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If it must be, our God whom we serve

00:44:36.724 --> 00:44:41.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is able to rescue us
from the burning fiery furnace, O king,

00:44:41.395 --> 00:44:43.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and to rescue us from your hand.

00:44:43.897 --> 00:44:48.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But even if he does not,
let it be known to you, O king,

00:44:48.802 --> 00:44:51.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that we will not serve your gods

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:55.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
or worship the image of gold
that you have set up.’”

00:44:55.642 --> 00:44:58.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, they trusted Jehovah.

00:44:58.145 --> 00:45:00.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another lesson:

00:45:00.147 --> 00:45:03.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Holy spirit will help us remain calm

00:45:03.917 --> 00:45:05.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not panic—

00:45:05.552 --> 00:45:07.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give a good answer to our persecutors.

00:45:07.988 --> 00:45:10.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think about what we just read,
the answer they gave

00:45:10.858 --> 00:45:12.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
—amazing composure—

00:45:12.993 --> 00:45:16.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
amazing answer they gave.

00:45:16.397 --> 00:45:19.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, holy spirit
was working powerfully upon them.

00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:22.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re promised
the same will be true for us.

00:45:22.603 --> 00:45:25.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 12:11, 12, Jesus said:

00:45:25.773 --> 00:45:28.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When they bring you in
before public assemblies,

00:45:28.275 --> 00:45:31.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“government officials, and authorities,

00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do not become anxious
about . . . what you will say,

00:45:34.214 --> 00:45:38.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the holy spirit will teach you
in that very hour” what to say.

00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:40.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another lesson:

00:45:40.687 --> 00:45:44.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can use his powerful angels

00:45:44.324 --> 00:45:48.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rescue us from an intimidating situation.

00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:52.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the case of the three Hebrews,
they were rescued miraculously.

00:45:52.566 --> 00:45:55.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the king looked into that furnace,

00:45:55.035 --> 00:45:59.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of seeing
three men bound being cremated,

00:45:59.406 --> 00:46:03.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saw four walking about freely,

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fourth obviously an angel.

00:46:05.879 --> 00:46:08.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when they were
brought out of that furnace,

00:46:08.415 --> 00:46:12.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel 3:27 says
they didn’t even have “the smell of fire.”

00:46:12.719 --> 00:46:15.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
No hair of their body was singed.

00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:17.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’ve been in homes
where people are smokers

00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:20.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you pick up
that smell of smoke very easily.

00:46:20.661 --> 00:46:25.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talking about singeing your hair,
hair singes very easily.

00:46:25.265 --> 00:46:30.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time back
I tried to light a gas stove using a match.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t get the timing exactly right.

00:46:33.907 --> 00:46:37.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
It blew back
—burned about half the hairs off my arm.

00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:41.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here, they didn’t have a hair singed,
not even the smell of smoke.

00:46:41.515 --> 00:46:45.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, today, we don’t expect Jehovah’s angels

00:46:45.552 --> 00:46:48.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deliver us miraculously.

00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:52.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah can use them
to maneuver circumstances.

00:46:52.926 --> 00:46:56.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we find a job to provide for our family.

00:46:56.597 --> 00:47:00.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we find a cooperative doctor
who respects our stand on blood,

00:47:00.834 --> 00:47:02.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
as just a couple of examples.

00:47:02.536 --> 00:47:05.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or he may use the angels to strengthen us

00:47:05.672 --> 00:47:09.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be faithful
in the face of that fiery test.

00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:11.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another lesson we can learn:

00:47:11.712 --> 00:47:14.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Firm belief in the resurrection

00:47:14.414 --> 00:47:17.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
can powerfully fortify us,

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we’re threatened with death.

00:47:19.286 --> 00:47:23.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Undoubtedly, those three Hebrews
knew Job’s words

00:47:23.156 --> 00:47:25.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Job 14:13,

00:47:25.192 --> 00:47:28.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Job asked Jehovah
to conceal him in the grave,

00:47:28.328 --> 00:47:30.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
set a time limit,

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then remember him—resurrect him.

00:47:33.367 --> 00:47:37.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely, they were familiar
with the resurrections of Elijah and Elisha.

00:47:37.838 --> 00:47:40.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, they didn’t know
if they’d be miraculously delivered,

00:47:40.741 --> 00:47:45.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they did know they would be resurrected
if they kept their integrity.

00:47:45.479 --> 00:47:47.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true with us today.

00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:50.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that firm belief in the resurrection,
if you think about it,

00:47:50.884 --> 00:47:54.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
strips Satan of his power

00:47:54.388 --> 00:47:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
to intimidate us even in the face of death.

00:47:57.925 --> 00:48:01.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could say that hope
is like our secret weapon.

00:48:01.795 --> 00:48:03.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s one more lesson we can learn:

00:48:03.997 --> 00:48:07.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remaining staunchly unintimidated

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
will give a powerful witness to onlookers.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what the king said

00:48:12.539 --> 00:48:15.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they came out unharmed
from that furnace?

00:48:15.609 --> 00:48:19.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Praised be the God of Shadrach,

00:48:19.313 --> 00:48:21.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Meshach, and Abednego, . . .

00:48:21.582 --> 00:48:24.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for there is no other god

00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:27.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is able to rescue like this one.”

00:48:27.621 --> 00:48:29.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about this,

00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:33.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Nebuchadnezzar
and other Babylonian onlookers

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
are resurrected as part of “the unrighteous”

00:48:36.296 --> 00:48:38.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at Acts 24:15,

00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:43.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
this experience will give them
a head start in the new world

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
on taking a stand with Jehovah.

00:48:45.072 --> 00:48:47.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about even the men

00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:50.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
who threw them
into the furnace who died doing so.

00:48:50.877 --> 00:48:52.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if they’re resurrected,

00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:56.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ll be told about what happened
subsequent to their untimely death.

00:48:56.583 --> 00:48:59.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
And undoubtedly, that will be an impetus

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:02.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward spiritual progress in the new world.

00:49:02.756 --> 00:49:04.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the same is true today.

00:49:04.891 --> 00:49:07.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we stand firm, unintimidated,

00:49:07.861 --> 00:49:10.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
we give a powerful witness.

00:49:10.364 --> 00:49:12.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are many that are now in the truth

00:49:12.766 --> 00:49:15.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a result of such a witness.

00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:17.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we have five

00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:21.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
anti-intimidation lessons

00:49:21.008 --> 00:49:23.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can learn from those three Hebrews.

00:49:23.577 --> 00:49:26.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
In review: Never quit trusting Jehovah

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the roars of the Devil.

00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:32.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two: Holy spirit will help us remain calm,

00:49:32.419 --> 00:49:34.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
not panic, and give a good answer.

00:49:34.488 --> 00:49:39.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three: Jehovah can use
his angels in various ways

00:49:39.092 --> 00:49:42.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rescue us
from intimidating circumstances.

00:49:42.729 --> 00:49:44.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
And number four:

00:49:44.197 --> 00:49:47.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
The resurrection hope
will powerfully fortify us

00:49:47.701 --> 00:49:52.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be intimidated
even in the face of death.

00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:56.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
And number five:
Remaining staunchly unintimidated

00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:00.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
will give a profound witness to onlookers.

00:50:00.514 --> 00:50:05.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may all of us,
like those three Hebrews, be determined

00:50:05.519 --> 00:50:09.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
to never let Satan intimidate us.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:15.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises to give all of us strength,
including young ones.

00:50:15.595 --> 00:50:18.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our young brother Elijah was just a teenager

00:50:18.832 --> 00:50:21.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he faced a life-changing situation.

00:50:21.902 --> 00:50:23.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s his story.

00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:28.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we continue to be faithful
in spite of our human weaknesses?

00:50:28.775 --> 00:50:33.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up I had, like,
absolutely no health problems at all.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I loved playing basketball, and I enjoyed

00:50:37.617 --> 00:50:41.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
my life in the congregation.

00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:42.756 line:10% position:50% align:center
This was a kid who had

00:50:42.756 --> 00:50:44.157 line:10% position:50% align:center
his whole life in front of him.

00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:48.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was taken away in a moment.

00:50:50.964 --> 00:50:53.600 line:10% position:50% align:center
In November of 2019, I was diagnosed

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.635 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a massive brain tumor.

00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:59.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was saying, like: “Why me?

00:50:59.339 --> 00:51:01.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I do something wrong?”

00:51:01.508 --> 00:51:04.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to know why it had to happen now

00:51:04.678 --> 00:51:07.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 16.

00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:09.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m close to 18

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I think is, like, the prime of my life.

00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:17.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
The night before I was going to have surgery

00:51:17.791 --> 00:51:20.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
was probably one of the scariest nights
of my life.

00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:24.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I wanted to be able
to still do the things that I loved,

00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:27.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I really just didn’t want my life to end.

00:51:29.035 --> 00:51:31.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account of David

00:51:31.037 --> 00:51:35.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
was one that was very prominent in my mind.

00:51:35.542 --> 00:51:39.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were many times in his life
when he had to fight foes

00:51:39.079 --> 00:51:41.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were very scary and life-threatening,

00:51:41.982 --> 00:51:46.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this situation I was dealing with
was pretty scary and life-threatening,

00:51:46.887 --> 00:51:49.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I knew Jehovah had my back.

00:51:51.024 --> 00:51:54.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked about getting
the brothers from HLC there to talk

00:51:54.261 --> 00:51:57.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to back us up
with the alternatives on his card.

00:51:57.397 --> 00:51:59.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
The doctor was impressed

00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:02.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he asked Elijah if he had any questions,

00:52:02.836 --> 00:52:05.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Elijah asked him a couple of questions
about the procedure

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:08.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then also brought up the blood issue.

00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:10.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
This showed the doctor

00:52:10.544 --> 00:52:14.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this was a young man
who had his own stand, his own convictions.

00:52:14.114 --> 00:52:18.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah tells me that blood is sacred,

00:52:18.118 --> 00:52:20.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
then I’m listening.

00:52:21.588 --> 00:52:23.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah kept on reminding us

00:52:23.623 --> 00:52:27.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even if he doesn’t wake up
on this surgery bed,

00:52:27.294 --> 00:52:29.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what happens,
he’s still going to wake up,

00:52:29.362 --> 00:52:33.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s now
or in the future in Paradise.

00:52:38.605 --> 00:52:40.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
They finally came out

00:52:40.874 --> 00:52:44.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
only to tell us
that there was a complication.

00:52:46.112 --> 00:52:49.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah fell into a coma,

00:52:49.449 --> 00:52:53.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were waiting on answers
that the doctors weren’t able to give us.

00:52:54.988 --> 00:52:59.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was roughly close to five months

00:52:59.059 --> 00:53:01.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was in a coma.

00:53:01.394 --> 00:53:04.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jehovah kept providing

00:53:04.898 --> 00:53:08.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
the friends, the support.

00:53:08.068 --> 00:53:10.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
We kept getting texts telling us

00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:14.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
just how many friends
were praying for Elijah

00:53:14.941 --> 00:53:18.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for all of us to get through this.

00:53:20.981 --> 00:53:22.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the spring of 2020

00:53:22.682 --> 00:53:26.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when I gradually began to wake up.

00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:31.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s way harder to move around as I used to

00:53:31.191 --> 00:53:33.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
—super painful and hard.

00:53:33.693 --> 00:53:37.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have ataxia as of right now
temporarily in my right hand,

00:53:37.764 --> 00:53:42.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I’m not able to perform certain activities

00:53:42.202 --> 00:53:44.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as I would like to.

00:53:48.141 --> 00:53:50.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my heart, I love basketball

00:53:50.477 --> 00:53:53.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wish I could participate,

00:53:53.613 --> 00:53:58.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
but knowing I can’t because of something
I can’t control physically

00:53:58.118 --> 00:54:00.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
is really hard on me.

00:54:01.855 --> 00:54:04.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job was always
a great example in the Bible to me.

00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:07.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
I view him in a totally different light now

00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:12.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he was also hit with a medical issue,

00:54:12.299 --> 00:54:15.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he managed to maintain his faith,

00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:18.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah eventually blessed Job for that.

00:54:18.905 --> 00:54:21.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the coma,
Elijah’s zeal definitely hasn’t lessened.

00:54:21.908 --> 00:54:24.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
If anything, it’s increased.

00:54:24.244 --> 00:54:26.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives a whole new meaning
to widening out,

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we want to be as zealous

00:54:28.882 --> 00:54:32.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as busy in the ministry as he is.

00:54:32.385 --> 00:54:35.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah has not accomplished any of this
in his own strength.

00:54:35.722 --> 00:54:39.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
He very quickly will give credit to Jehovah

00:54:39.025 --> 00:54:42.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also will give credit to his family
for the amount of support that he’s received

00:54:42.729 --> 00:54:44.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give credit to the brothers and sisters

00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:46.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the support he’s received
from them as well.

00:54:46.766 --> 00:54:48.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s been engaged in the field ministry,

00:54:48.768 --> 00:54:51.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s been active
in doing whatever assignments we give him

00:54:51.671 --> 00:54:53.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
within the congregation.

00:54:53.373 --> 00:54:56.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to appoint him
as a ministerial servant.

00:54:56.042 --> 00:54:57.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s got all this support.

00:54:57.577 --> 00:54:59.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that Jehovah is with him

00:54:59.112 --> 00:55:02.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that in that sense
Jehovah truly is at his right hand.

00:55:02.415 --> 00:55:04.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that we have a hope

00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:08.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given us for the future
of perfect life.

00:55:08.555 --> 00:55:10.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives me a goal and more of a motivation

00:55:10.924 --> 00:55:14.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help everyone reach that goal
and get there.

00:55:14.694 --> 00:55:17.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s light at the end of the tunnel,

00:55:17.364 --> 00:55:19.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I thank Jehovah for that so much.

00:55:21.534 --> 00:55:26.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah, you are a precious gem
in Jehovah’s eyes!

00:55:27.207 --> 00:55:30.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our whole program
has highlighted that each one of us

00:55:30.143 --> 00:55:34.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a special place
in Jehovah’s beautiful family.

00:55:34.147 --> 00:55:38.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
As part of the family,
would you like to see the invitation video

00:55:38.351 --> 00:55:40.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this year’s regional convention?

00:55:40.854 --> 00:55:44.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
The theme is “Exercise Patience!”

00:55:46.793 --> 00:55:49.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was the last time
you lost your patience?

00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:52.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the road?

00:55:52.432 --> 00:55:54.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
at work?

00:55:54.434 --> 00:55:56.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
or at home?

00:55:57.103 --> 00:55:58.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our busy lives

00:55:58.905 --> 00:56:00.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
make it difficult for us to be patient.

00:56:02.375 --> 00:56:04.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to enjoy life,

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:06.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need patience more than ever

00:56:06.246 --> 00:56:08.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even if it’s being tested.

00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:11.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does patience really mean?

00:56:13.253 --> 00:56:15.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it mean we just passively wait

00:56:15.855 --> 00:56:17.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
for something to change?

00:56:18.591 --> 00:56:21.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can patience affect our daily life?

00:56:24.264 --> 00:56:27.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 2023 “Exercise Patience”!

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:56:29.602 --> 00:56:31.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
will show you what true patience is,

00:56:32.539 --> 00:56:34.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
why we need it,

00:56:35.942 --> 00:56:38.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it can improve
our relationships with others.

00:56:43.183 --> 00:56:45.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
God wants you to be happy.

00:56:46.152 --> 00:56:47.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as our Creator,

00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:52.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knows that exercising patience is vital.

00:56:56.229 --> 00:57:00.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
For more information, go to jw.org.

00:57:01.201 --> 00:57:04.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of whom you can share
this invitation video with

00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:07.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you pique their interest.

00:57:07.006 --> 00:57:09.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hopefully they will attend with us.

00:57:09.976 --> 00:57:12.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to see a little more?

00:57:12.412 --> 00:57:17.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year’s convention will also feature
a two-part modern-day drama.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:19.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we won’t give away the story line,

00:57:19.853 --> 00:57:22.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here’s a preview to whet your appetite.

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Mom and Dad were alive,

00:57:32.732 --> 00:57:34.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would be very proud of you.

00:57:36.302 --> 00:57:37.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what I’m thinking?

00:57:37.837 --> 00:57:39.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could have more.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m talking about real security

00:57:42.308 --> 00:57:44.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you and the family

00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:46.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a government carpentry contract.

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Radio 93.6:

00:57:53.086 --> 00:57:55.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
As an update to our report from yesterday,

00:57:55.455 --> 00:57:57.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
militia groups are threatening

00:57:57.123 --> 00:57:59.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take over the capital.

00:57:59.125 --> 00:58:01.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Violence has been escalating in the area.

00:58:01.961 --> 00:58:03.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you are aware,

00:58:03.496 --> 00:58:05.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch has recommended that we meet

00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:07.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
and discuss the possibility

00:58:07.133 --> 00:58:09.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
of civil unrest in our area.

00:58:09.435 --> 00:58:11.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will always be rumors

00:58:11.037 --> 00:58:12.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
surrounding the elections.

00:58:12.972 --> 00:58:15.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
The safety of the congregation is the concern.

00:58:19.712 --> 00:58:21.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no need to worry.

00:58:23.183 --> 00:58:25.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are just threats, rumors.

00:58:25.785 --> 00:58:27.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing to it.

00:58:29.355 --> 00:58:31.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received direction from the branch.

00:58:32.325 --> 00:58:35.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those brothers are so far away though.

00:58:35.461 --> 00:58:37.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
I keep wondering

00:58:37.096 --> 00:58:39.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they are being overly cautious.

00:58:41.134 --> 00:58:42.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Amani:

00:58:43.636 --> 00:58:46.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your strength

00:58:46.105 --> 00:58:49.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be in keeping calm

00:58:49.943 --> 00:58:52.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showing trust.”

00:58:52.845 --> 00:58:54.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wake up!

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wake up!

00:58:56.482 --> 00:58:58.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you still trusting these people to guide your life?

00:59:00.587 --> 00:59:02.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Father Jehovah,

00:59:02.622 --> 00:59:04.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
please help me.

00:59:12.632 --> 00:59:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has approved

00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:18.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
a new original song
to conclude the convention.

00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:21.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m happy to announce
that the song and lyrics

00:59:21.274 --> 00:59:25.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
are now available for download on jw.org.

00:59:25.878 --> 00:59:30.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body requests
that everyone practice before the convention

00:59:30.583 --> 00:59:34.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that unitedly
we can sing out with all our hearts.

00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:37.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some will need help to download the song.

00:59:37.757 --> 00:59:42.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please keep them in mind
and provide help as needed.

00:59:42.028 --> 00:59:45.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can even practice singing
the song with them

00:59:45.565 --> 00:59:48.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
in preparation for the convention.

00:59:48.668 --> 00:59:53.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can see, we have a lot
to look forward to in the months ahead

00:59:53.339 --> 00:59:57.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
—further evidence of how much
Jehovah cherishes his people.

00:59:59.412 --> 01:00:02.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now for this month’s video postcard,

01:00:02.982 --> 01:00:06.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s travel to the heart
of the Mediterranean Sea

01:00:06.319 --> 01:00:09.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we find the island nation of Malta.

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:14.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Malta is made up of five small islands,

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
three of which are inhabited:

01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:18.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Malta, the largest;

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:22.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gozo; and tiny Comino,

01:00:22.902 --> 01:00:25.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
which has an area of just one square mile,

01:00:25.838 --> 01:00:27.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
or about three square kilometers.

01:00:28.675 --> 01:00:31.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
These islands are known
for their rocky coastlines

01:00:31.444 --> 01:00:34.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
and steep limestone cliffs.

01:00:34.447 --> 01:00:38.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Malta’s location—with Italy to the north

01:00:38.284 --> 01:00:40.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Africa to the south—

01:00:40.286 --> 01:00:42.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
is reflected in its language.

01:00:42.755 --> 01:00:45.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maltese is a blend of an Arabic dialect

01:00:45.758 --> 01:00:50.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
spoken in North Africa
and a Sicilian dialect of Italian.

01:00:50.697 --> 01:00:54.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spoken Maltese sounds like Arabic,

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:56.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s written using a Latin alphabet.

01:00:56.869 --> 01:00:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maltese and English

01:00:59.038 --> 01:01:02.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
are the country’s two official languages.

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:06.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
The many harbors and beaches
found throughout Malta

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:09.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
might bring to mind
its one and only mention in the Bible.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:13.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was along these shores that in 58 C.E.,

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul was shipwrecked
on his way to Rome.

01:01:16.689 --> 01:01:21.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that the islanders
showed Paul and his companions

01:01:21.327 --> 01:01:24.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“extraordinary kindness,”

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:29.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many of the Maltese people today
have responded favorably to the good news.

01:01:29.135 --> 01:01:33.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
In modern times, the preaching work
was established here in the 1970’s.

01:01:34.474 --> 01:01:36.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are 11 congregations in Malta,

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:39.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
with over 800 total publishers.

01:01:39.479 --> 01:01:42.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people on the islands have migrated

01:01:42.181 --> 01:01:46.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
from parts of Africa, Eastern Europe,
and the Philippines,

01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:49.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the congregations preach
in eight different languages.

01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:53.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers in Malta enjoy
public witnessing throughout the islands,

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:57.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the Port of Valetta,
where a Tagalog congregation

01:01:57.697 --> 01:02:01.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaches to the many Filipinos
who work on the ships that visit the harbor.

01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:05.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the island of Gozo,
there are two congregations

01:02:05.772 --> 01:02:09.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one Maltese and the other English—

01:02:09.075 --> 01:02:14.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a combined total of 112 publishers
and 34 pioneers.

01:02:14.947 --> 01:02:19.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bethel family in Malta,
along with the brothers and sisters in Gozo,

01:02:19.619 --> 01:02:21.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their love to you all.

01:02:22.388 --> 01:02:25.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:27.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
