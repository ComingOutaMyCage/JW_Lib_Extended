00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:14.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, you.

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:15.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Haitian community in our area
was growing,

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:41.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a new Haitian Creole congregation
was formed nearby.

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
We checked out their territory

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:46.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saw that they needed a lot of help.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Step on over.”

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:53.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
So should we do this?

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been praying for more studies.

00:00:56.086 --> 00:00:58.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think this might just be my answer.

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:58.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:00:58.673 --> 00:00:59.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m in.

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:01.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good. Then as soon as we get home,
we can pray about it.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:08.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our new language was exciting.

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:12.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
We spent every spare second we had

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to get better.

00:01:18.404 --> 00:01:21.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had so much joy,

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:23.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we had challenges too.

00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:48.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nicolas,

00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:50.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nicolas,

00:01:52.277 --> 00:01:54.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
could you read the next paragraph
for us, please?

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:58.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, sorry.
Where are we?

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:11.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our study was so nice today,
wasn’t it, Nicolas?

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:13.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet again, I was totally lost.

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:20.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t realize
that Nico just wasn’t finding

00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:22.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
the same joy as us.

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:28.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help Nico,
we did a few more things in our language.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Besides family worship,

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
we attended one meeting a month

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:36.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our old congregation.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, honestly,
I’m a little worried about Nico.

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:43.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s having a tough time
adapting to our new congregation.

00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:45.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I get it.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, back when we first joined
a foreign-language congregation,

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything was fun and new.

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:52.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after a little while,

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:56.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
we noticed that our kids
had lost their enthusiasm.

00:02:56.144 --> 00:02:58.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were still hearing about Jehovah,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, honestly, they weren’t learning
because it wasn’t in their language.

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:03.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that why you moved back?

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was.

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:06.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
But every family is different.

00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:09.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
We each have to decide
what’s best for our own.

00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks, that’s true.

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found the perfect article

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us decide what to do.

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:19.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
It mentioned the example of Daniel.

00:03:20.422 --> 00:03:23.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had to speak
different languages every day,

00:03:23.718 --> 00:03:28.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he made sure to study in Hebrew,
his language.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:34.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article mentioned Psalm 119:11:

00:03:34.772 --> 00:03:38.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In my heart I treasure up your saying.”

00:03:39.862 --> 00:03:43.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Nico to treasure God’s Word in his heart,

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:46.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
we felt he needed even more guidance

00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:48.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the language of his heart.

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:53.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is,

00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:55.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’m at the meeting in my language,
it’s different.

00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:58.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t have to think a lot
just to understand what I’m hearing.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I think it’s clear
what’s best for our family.

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:02.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is.

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:04.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about your students?

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:07.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK, Nico.
We’ll find a way to help them.

00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:10.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
The language we’re immersed in every day
is the language of your heart.

00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:13.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s best for you
to keep growing spiritually

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that same language.

00:04:17.364 --> 00:04:19.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the best decision

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order for Nico to stay close to Jehovah.

00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:28.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we did miss the Haitian Creole field.

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:30.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a few years later . . .

00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:32.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:35.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a little nervous, but I think I’m ready.

00:04:39.348 --> 00:04:41.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided it was the right time

00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
to move back.

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:49.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so glad our decision helped Nico

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
build a solid foundation

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his faith and his future.
