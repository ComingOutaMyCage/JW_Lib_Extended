Congo is certainly not among

00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:05.861 line:10% position:50% align:center
the most popular travel destinations

00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:07.863 line:10% position:50% align:center
for tourists around the world,

00:00:07.863 --> 00:00:11.326 line:10% position:50% align:center
but it is definitely a preaching paradise.

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:15.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
In general, very few people have reservations

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discuss their personal
spiritual convictions with strangers.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:24.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, Jehovah’s Witnesses
are well-known for their high moral standards

00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:28.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their consistent Bible education.

00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:31.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not uncommon for non-Witness parents

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:35.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
to even solicit the services
of a Witness Bible teacher

00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:39.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to help their children
become better persons

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
and improve their performance in school.

00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:44.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:47.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of Bible studies
is about three times

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:50.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of active Witnesses.

00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:52.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Memorial attendance figures

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:56.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
amount to almost five times
the number of publishers.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can imagine,

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:03.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a country where Internet connections
are pretty unstable in urban areas

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
and almost unavailable in more remote places,

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:10.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was a tremendous challenge
for the friends to adapt

00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:14.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the alternative COVID-19 meeting
and preaching methods.

00:01:15.822 --> 00:01:20.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our branch benefited
from many additional arrangements

00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:24.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have been kindly put in place
to assist these brothers and sisters

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:28.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep up-to-date with spiritual food
and stay active in the ministry,

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:33.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the JW satellite TV channel,

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
the JW Box network,

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:38.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prerecorded public talks

00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:41.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
broadcast on local radio stations.

00:01:42.897 --> 00:01:45.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, publishers came up with some

00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:49.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
very practical alternative
preaching methods themselves.

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:51.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:56.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a rural congregation called Mpeshi
deep in the interior,

00:01:56.456 --> 00:02:01.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
the news of a worldwide pandemic
costing hundreds of thousands of lives

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:04.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
hadn’t been perceived
as more than background noise.

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:09.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, a temporary special pioneer
called Emmanuel

00:02:09.347 --> 00:02:13.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
was determined to apply
theocratic COVID-19 instructions.

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:18.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how could he continue
to conduct his Bible studies

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a place with no Internet coverage

00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:24.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with students
who don’t even possess smartphones?

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what he came up with:

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:32.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
As his house has a main entrance
and a back door,

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:36.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
he advised his Bible students
to come one by one

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:38.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enter through the back door,

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
which he left open

00:02:40.552 --> 00:02:44.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
(each one with his own chair
not touching anything in the room),

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:48.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sit down next to the closed door
leading to the living room.

00:02:49.312 --> 00:02:52.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emmanuel himself used the main door,

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:55.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
sat on the other side
of that closed door in the living room,

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:59.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conducted his studies,
so to speak, behind a closed door.

00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:05.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s go back to the urban areas.

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:09.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here government-imposed
COVID-19 restrictions

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a great impact

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:15.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
on thousands of our
self-employed brothers and sisters

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
who overnight were cut off

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:21.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their already meager sources of income.

00:03:22.228 --> 00:03:24.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our branch was authorized

00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:27.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide about 3,000 tons of staple food

00:03:27.777 --> 00:03:31.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
for more than 200,000 beneficiaries.

00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:34.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
One hundred thirteen
Disaster Relief Committees

00:03:34.827 --> 00:03:38.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
distributed this humanitarian aid

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
in only four months.

00:03:41.752 --> 00:03:46.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
As food trucks
pulled up at Kingdom Hall properties

00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:50.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
and later hundreds of individuals
left with care packages,

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:53.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
many onlookers were deeply impressed.

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:58.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once more, they realized
how different Jehovah’s organization is

00:03:58.523 --> 00:04:01.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all the other
religious entities around them.

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:07.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
While many pastors and preachers
urged their church members

00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:10.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them financially during the pandemic,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Witnesses distributed free goods
to needy ones in their community.

00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:22.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Definitely “the fields [in Congo] 
are white for harvesting,”

00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:24.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reapers rejoice.
