00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:12.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brazil is the largest country
in South America

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
—from the Amazon rain forest

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:17.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the rich farmland

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:19.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the beautiful coastline.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:23.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paraguay borders Brazil

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:27.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is the eighth largest country
in South America.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:31.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its diverse geography includes major rivers,

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
vast plains,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fertile farmland.

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wondered how the Bethel families
in those countries were doing

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
after some two and a half years
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Dellinger and I,
along with our wives, Lourdes and Angela,

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
began our journey from Warwick Bethel

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a flight to São Paulo, Brazil.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the recent presidential election,

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
large protests in São Paulo
were blocking key roads,

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the road
from the airport to the branch office.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:04.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah provided

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
an unexpected solution.

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to the generosity
of a Witness family,

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:14.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were transported from the airport
in record time.

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:17.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had no problem finding a parking space

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the Bethel soccer field.

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch is located in a rural area

00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serves as a home
to some 1,200 volunteers.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
During our visit,
the entire Bethel family

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:35.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoyed morning worship and breakfast
in the dining room.

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:37.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Irmãos, bom dia! </i>

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you excited to be here
for the branch visit?

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are too.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:49.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the first stops on our tour
was the large printery.

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with the Governing Body’s desire
to provide printed material,

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brazil produced publications
in 65 languages last year.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brazil also serves as a warehousing branch.

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:02.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means Brazil can print,
stock, and ship literature directly

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
to individual congregations

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay,

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:17.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brazil also ships publications to branches

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Colombia, Mexico, the United States,

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:22.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
South Africa, Germany, and Japan.

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition,
there are ten remote translation offices

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:30.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
that translate our publications
into other languages spoken in Brazil.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brazil Bethel has two museums;

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
one is devoted
to the history of Bible translation

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the other shows
the history of Jehovah’s people in Brazil.

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:46.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Brazil branch
also provides the Art Department in Patterson

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
with photos and artwork for our publications.

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you recognize some of these scenes.

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:58.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the oversight
of Audio/Video Services at headquarters,

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brazil has a regional video team.

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:03.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ready, set, action!

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:09.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
With all of this activity
and over 900,000 publishers to support,

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch is being renovated and modernized.

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:16.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many commuter Bethelites
are sharing in this project

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:19.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, as you can see,
all are happy to help.

00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:23.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another highlight of our visit was
the special dinner with the Bethel family,

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
which featured the Bethel chorus,

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
traditional dancing,

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some excellent field service experiences.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:35.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Naturally,
we couldn’t wait to see for ourselves

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:37.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
what field service was like.

00:03:37.738 --> 00:03:38.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, sure enough,

00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:42.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
we found that,
both in the rural areas and in the city,

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
people were polite, easy to talk with,

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and receptive to the Kingdom message.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
We couldn’t help but think that many more

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:54.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
may yet come into Jehovah’s organization
in this large country.

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:57.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the Assembly Hall on the branch property,

00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:00.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were able to enjoy a special program

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:03.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Bethel family
and nearby congregations.

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:05.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 2,000 attended.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
After our final meal with the Bethel family,

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:11.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was hard to hold back the tears
as we said our farewells.

00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:17.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But just before our departure,
we heard of more road blockages!

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:20.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would we be able to get
to São Paulo in time for our flight?

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:32.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon our arrival at Paraguay Bethel,

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:35.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were surprised and overwhelmed.

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:37.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a welcome!

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Paraguay branch is located

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:42.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
just outside the capital city of Asunción.

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just a block down the street,

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:46.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful new Assembly Hall

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:48.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
and School for Kingdom Evangelizers facility

00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:50.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
were nearing completion.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
The enthusiasm of the construction volunteers
was contagious.

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:59.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just a few weeks after our visit,

00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:01.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Assembly Hall and school facility
were completed.

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:08.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are about 100 members
in the Paraguay Bethel family,

00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:11.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
which cares
for the 11,000 publishers in the country.

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:15.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
The largest department at the branch
is Translation.

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:19.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
These dear brothers and sisters
devote much effort

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
to translate our publications and our website

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:23.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the Guaraní language.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has proven to be a blessing

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:28.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
for honesthearted ones
throughout the country.

00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:31.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, we learned
of a Guaraní-speaking woman named Angelina.

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:35.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic,
Angelina studied the Bible by cell phone.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because she lives in a remote location,

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:41.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
electricity is unreliable.

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that did not deter Angelina.

00:05:44.031 --> 00:05:47.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
For her Bible study,
Angelina walked four kilometers,

00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:50.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
or two and a half miles,
round-trip to charge her cell phone.

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
As she progressed,
she walked that distance more often

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:56.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that she could connect to our meetings.

00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:57.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it worth the effort?

00:05:57.377 --> 00:06:00.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Angelina is now baptized

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:02.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and her husband is studying the Bible!

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:05.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were curious
about what we would find in the ministry.

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
In one city park,
virtually everyone we spoke with

00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:12.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
was polite, humble, and willing to talk.

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:16.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next day,
despite an outbreak of COVID-19,

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:18.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoyed a special meeting

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:21.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was transmitted
to all congregations throughout the country.

00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:23.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
The program featured experiences

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:26.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
that highlighted
the progress of the preaching work.

00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:28.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt many more

00:06:28.784 --> 00:06:31.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
will respond to the Kingdom message
in Paraguay.

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:34.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the special meal with the Bethel family,

00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:36.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoyed delicious food

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:40.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with traditional dancing and singing.

00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:43.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also enjoyed hearing
nice experiences of Bethelites

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:45.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
who witnessed by letter and telephone
during the pandemic.

00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:52.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, as was true of Brazil,

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Paraguay Bethel family
is united and joyful.

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:58.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many in the Bethel family said,

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:01.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We did not realize
how much we needed this visit.”

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:06.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, these visits are evidence
of the Governing Body’s love

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:09.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
in caring for our Bethel families worldwide.

00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:13.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can imagine,

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:16.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was hard to tear ourselves away
from our dear brothers and sisters.

00:07:16.915 --> 00:07:19.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we rejoiced in seeing

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:21.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah has so lovingly cared for them

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the past few years.

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will remember them fondly.

00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:34.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both Bethel families
send their warm love to the Governing Body.
