00:00:08 Brazil is the largest country in South America
00:00:12 —from the Amazon rain forest
00:00:15 to the rich farmland
00:00:17 and the beautiful coastline.
00:00:21 Paraguay borders Brazil
00:00:23 and is the eighth largest country in South America.
00:00:27 Its diverse geography includes major rivers,
00:00:31 vast plains,
00:00:33 and fertile farmland.
00:00:35 We wondered how the Bethel families in those countries were doing
00:00:38 after some two and a half years of the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:00:42 Brother Dellinger and I, along with our wives, Lourdes and Angela,
00:00:46 began our journey from Warwick Bethel
00:00:48 with a flight to São Paulo, Brazil.
00:00:51 But after the recent presidential election,
00:00:54 large protests in São Paulo were blocking key roads,
00:00:58 including the road from the airport to the branch office.
00:01:02 But Jehovah provided
00:01:04 an unexpected solution.
00:01:07 Thanks to the generosity of a Witness family,
00:01:10 we were transported from the airport in record time.
00:01:14 We had no problem finding a parking space
00:01:17 on the Bethel soccer field.
00:01:22 The branch is located in a rural area
00:01:24 and serves as a home to some 1,200 volunteers.
00:01:28 During our visit, the entire Bethel family
00:01:31 enjoyed morning worship and breakfast in the dining room.
00:01:35 Irmãos, bom dia!
00:01:39 Are you excited to be here for the branch visit?
00:01:43 We are too.
00:01:45 One of the first stops on our tour was the large printery.
00:01:49 In harmony with the Governing Body’s desire to provide printed material,
00:01:53 Brazil produced publications in 65 languages last year.
00:01:58 Brazil also serves as a warehousing branch.
00:02:01 What is that?
00:02:02 It means Brazil can print, stock, and ship literature directly
00:02:06 to individual congregations
00:02:08 in Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay,
00:02:11 Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.
00:02:14 Brazil also ships publications to branches
00:02:17 in Colombia, Mexico, the United States,
00:02:19 South Africa, Germany, and Japan.
00:02:23 In addition, there are ten remote translation offices
00:02:26 that translate our publications into other languages spoken in Brazil.
00:02:31 Brazil Bethel has two museums;
00:02:34 one is devoted to the history of Bible translation
00:02:37 and the other shows the history of Jehovah’s people in Brazil.
00:02:42 The Brazil branch also provides the Art Department in Patterson
00:02:46 with photos and artwork for our publications.
00:02:50 Perhaps you recognize some of these scenes.
00:02:55 Under the oversight of Audio/Video Services at headquarters,
00:02:58 Brazil has a regional video team.
00:03:01 Ready, set, action!
00:03:05 With all of this activity and over 900,000 publishers to support,
00:03:09 the branch is being renovated and modernized.
00:03:12 Many commuter Bethelites are sharing in this project
00:03:16 and, as you can see, all are happy to help.
00:03:19 Another highlight of our visit was the special dinner with the Bethel family,
00:03:23 which featured the Bethel chorus,
00:03:26 traditional dancing,
00:03:28 and some excellent field service experiences.
00:03:33 Naturally, we couldn’t wait to see for ourselves
00:03:35 what field service was like.
00:03:37 And, sure enough,
00:03:38 we found that, both in the rural areas and in the city,
00:03:42 people were polite, easy to talk with,
00:03:45 and receptive to the Kingdom message.
00:03:48 We couldn’t help but think that many more
00:03:50 may yet come into Jehovah’s organization in this large country.
00:03:54 At the Assembly Hall on the branch property,
00:03:57 we were able to enjoy a special program
00:04:00 with the Bethel family and nearby congregations.
00:04:03 Over 2,000 attended.
00:04:05 After our final meal with the Bethel family,
00:04:08 it was hard to hold back the tears as we said our farewells.
00:04:12 But just before our departure, we heard of more road blockages!
00:04:17 Would we be able to get to São Paulo in time for our flight?
00:04:22 Absolutely.
00:04:30 Upon our arrival at Paraguay Bethel,
00:04:32 we were surprised and overwhelmed.
00:04:35 What a welcome!
00:04:37 The Paraguay branch is located
00:04:39 just outside the capital city of Asunción.
00:04:42 Just a block down the street,
00:04:44 a beautiful new Assembly Hall
00:04:46 and School for Kingdom Evangelizers facility
00:04:48 were nearing completion.
00:04:51 The enthusiasm of the construction volunteers was contagious.
00:04:56 Just a few weeks after our visit,
00:04:59 the Assembly Hall and school facility were completed.
00:05:03 There are about 100 members in the Paraguay Bethel family,
00:05:08 which cares for the 11,000 publishers in the country.
00:05:11 The largest department at the branch is Translation.
00:05:15 These dear brothers and sisters devote much effort
00:05:19 to translate our publications and our website
00:05:21 into the Guaraní language.
00:05:23 This has proven to be a blessing
00:05:25 for honesthearted ones throughout the country.
00:05:28 For example, we learned of a Guaraní-speaking woman named Angelina.
00:05:32 During the pandemic, Angelina studied the Bible by cell phone.
00:05:35 But because she lives in a remote location,
00:05:39 electricity is unreliable.
00:05:42 But that did not deter Angelina.
00:05:44 For her Bible study, Angelina walked four kilometers,
00:05:47 or two and a half miles, round-trip to charge her cell phone.
00:05:50 As she progressed, she walked that distance more often
00:05:53 so that she could connect to our meetings.
00:05:56 Was it worth the effort?
00:05:57 Today, Angelina is now baptized
00:06:00 and her husband is studying the Bible!
00:06:02 We were curious about what we would find in the ministry.
00:06:05 In one city park, virtually everyone we spoke with
00:06:09 was polite, humble, and willing to talk.
00:06:12 The next day, despite an outbreak of COVID-19,
00:06:16 we enjoyed a special meeting
00:06:18 that was transmitted to all congregations throughout the country.
00:06:21 The program featured experiences
00:06:23 that highlighted the progress of the preaching work.
00:06:26 No doubt many more
00:06:28 will respond to the Kingdom message in Paraguay.
00:06:31 For the special meal with the Bethel family,
00:06:34 we enjoyed delicious food
00:06:36 along with traditional dancing and singing.
00:06:40 We also enjoyed hearing nice experiences of Bethelites
00:06:43 who witnessed by letter and telephone during the pandemic.
00:06:49 Yes, as was true of Brazil,
00:06:52 the Paraguay Bethel family is united and joyful.
00:06:55 Many in the Bethel family said,
00:06:58 “We did not realize how much we needed this visit.”
00:07:02 Truly, these visits are evidence of the Governing Body’s love
00:07:06 in caring for our Bethel families worldwide.
00:07:11 As you can imagine,
00:07:13 it was hard to tear ourselves away from our dear brothers and sisters.
00:07:16 But we rejoiced in seeing
00:07:19 how Jehovah has so lovingly cared for them
00:07:21 during the past few years.
00:07:25 We will remember them fondly.
00:07:29 Both Bethel families send their warm love to the Governing Body.
