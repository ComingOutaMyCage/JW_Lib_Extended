00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram, dinner is almost ready.

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:12.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please tell Shem.

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be right there, Mom.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Abram, before we go in,

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
let me tell you the rest.

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:20.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just a young man back then.

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Jehovah gave my father

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
the command to build the ark,

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
it took decades to complete.

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we had to gather food and all the animals.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had no idea how long we would be inside.

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:46.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Jehovah closed the ark’s door,

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were ready.

00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
So were you scared?

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram, I know you’re just a boy,

00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:58.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
but things have happened to you

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:00.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have scared you, right?

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:01.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was older than you, but I was still scared.

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:07.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we were building the ark,

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
people thought we were crazy.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, just like Jehovah said it would,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
it happened.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:50.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only eight were saved

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my parents, my brothers, and our wives.

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were living proof that Jehovah’s word never fails.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised my father

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
that He would never again destroy all life

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a global Flood.

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want you to know I was scared,

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I know to trust Jehovah.

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah promises something

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:12.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve never seen,

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
it takes a special quality to believe it.

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know what that quality is?

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith.

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram and Sarai lived in Ur,

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
a city full of people who worshipped pagan gods.

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Noah and Shem,

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:54.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram and Sarai worshipped Jehovah.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram.

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:12.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram, go out from your land

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from your relatives

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:18.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come into the land that I will show you.

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:56.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where will we live?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be so far away from our family.

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:01.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have every confidence

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:04.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if we do what Jehovah asks,

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:06.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
things will turn out fine.

00:04:06.683 --> 00:04:07.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well,

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:13.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever it is, I will be by your side.

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is nothing I wouldn’t sacrifice for Jehovah.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know. I know.

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:28.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram and Sarai left Ur.

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:30.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lived in Haran for some time,

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah told Abram to keep moving.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living in tents was not easy,

00:04:39.508 --> 00:04:41.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the caravan gradually settled

00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:43.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a routine of travel.

00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram’s nephew Lot was like a brother to him.

00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:57.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as their flocks grew large,

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:00.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
tension grew between their groups.

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, there should be

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
no quarreling between me and you,

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:12.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
for we are brothers.

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:15.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is not the whole land available to you?

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, separate from me.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you go to the left,

00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:21.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
then I will go to the right.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though it must have hurt their hearts,

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:28.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
they agreed to part ways.

00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:33.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lot moved east to the district of the Jordan

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:36.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:38.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
were located.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Lot had gone,

00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:45.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made a promise about Abram’s future.

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:49.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Raise your eyes, please,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look from the place where you are,

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:54.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the north and south,

00:05:54.917 --> 00:05:58.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
east and west,

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:01.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all the land that you see,

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will give to you and your offspring

00:06:03.884 --> 00:06:05.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a lasting possession.

00:06:05.928 --> 00:06:08.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will make your offspring

00:06:08.138 --> 00:06:11.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the dust particles of the earth.

00:06:54.184 --> 00:06:55.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not fear, Abram.

00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:03.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am a shield for you.

00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:07.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your reward will be very great.

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:09.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sovereign Lord Jehovah,

00:07:10.492 --> 00:07:12.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will you give me,

00:07:12.202 --> 00:07:14.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing that I continue childless?

00:07:14.997 --> 00:07:16.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go outside.

00:07:16.748 --> 00:07:19.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look up, please,

00:07:19.668 --> 00:07:23.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the heavens and count the stars,

00:07:23.213 --> 00:07:25.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you are able to do so.

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:31.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
So your offspring will become.

00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:37.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, Jehovah changed Abram’s name

00:07:37.477 --> 00:07:39.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Abraham,

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:42.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means “Father of a Multitude.”

00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:46.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also changed Sarai’s name to Sarah,

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:48.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means “Princess.”

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day, these new names

00:07:52.576 --> 00:07:55.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
would remind them of Jehovah’s promise.

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:02.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah didn’t stop there.

00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:06.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sent three angels to reassure Abraham

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
with even more good news.

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:15.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within the year, he and Sarah would have a son.

00:08:24.858 --> 00:08:27.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they also brought other news.

00:08:28.862 --> 00:08:32.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through one of the angels, Jehovah said:

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah

00:08:34.242 --> 00:08:35.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
is indeed great,

00:08:35.744 --> 00:08:37.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their sin is very heavy.

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:57.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:00.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose there are 50 righteous men within the city.

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:03.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you, then, sweep them away

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not pardon the place for the sake

00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:07.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 50 righteous who are inside it?

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:11.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s unthinkable of you.

00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:15.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will the Judge of all the earth not do what is right?

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:21.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I find in Sodom 50 righteous men in the city,

00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:23.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will pardon the whole place for their sake.

00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:26.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, here I presume to speak to Jehovah,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas I am dust and ashes.

00:09:30.924 --> 00:09:33.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose the 50 righteous should lack five.

00:09:34.553 --> 00:09:37.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the five will you destroy the whole city?

00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:41.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham knew that the Judge of all the earth

00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
always does what is right.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
But knowing and trusting

00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:47.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
are two different things.

00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:50.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will not destroy it for the sake of the 20.

00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:53.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, please, do not become hot with anger,

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:56.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
but let me speak just once more:

00:09:56.032 --> 00:09:58.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose only ten are found there.

00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.

00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:17.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have seen in my life that everything

00:10:17.262 --> 00:10:20.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah promises always comes true.

00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:24.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout your life have full confidence

00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:27.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will always do what is right.
