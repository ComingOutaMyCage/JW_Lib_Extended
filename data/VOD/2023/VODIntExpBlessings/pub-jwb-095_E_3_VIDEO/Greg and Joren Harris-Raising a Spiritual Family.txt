00:00:02 When a person makes a sacrifice,
00:00:04 they give up something
00:00:06 for something that they consider
00:00:07 is of higher value.
00:00:09 What kind of a price tag can you put
00:00:12 on your child’s love for Jehovah?
00:00:16 What kind of a price tag can you put
00:00:18 on serving Jehovah whole-souled as a family?
00:00:23 When I found out that we were going to have a family,
00:00:27 it was overwhelming for me.
00:00:29 When you come into the truth—
00:00:32 We weren’t Witnesses when I was a child.
00:00:35 Sometimes you’re exposed to things that leave you with baggage,
00:00:40 leave you unsure of yourself.
00:00:42 You need constant reassurance that you’re going to be OK,
00:00:47 that you can take care of any situation that comes along.
00:00:51 My dad—he gave me all I needed.
00:00:54 He loved me so much.
00:00:56 I would take my mother’s knitting yarn,
00:00:58 and I would tie it to his door handle after he went to sleep.
00:01:02 And I would run it across the hall to my bedroom
00:01:04 and tie it to my big toe
00:01:06 so that when he opened his door in the morning,
00:01:08 I would wake up  and I could be with him.
00:01:10 That love that I had for my dad
00:01:14 —I wanted them to love Jehovah that much.
00:01:17 I wanted a string tied around their hearts right to Jehovah
00:01:21 so that he was the one motivating them
00:01:24 and he was the one waking them up spiritually every day.
00:01:28 I loved to teach the children things,
00:01:32 and I would do it at any available moment.
00:01:35 And then, of course, at night, as a family
00:01:37 (usually on our bed), we would read our Bible together.
00:01:40 It was the glue that kept us tied to Jehovah
00:01:45 and kept us tied to each other.
00:01:48 In Judges 7, Gideon said:
00:01:51 “Watch me and do . . . what I do.”
00:01:54 So I knew that if we wanted the children to live the truth,
00:02:00 we had to live it with them.
00:02:03 It couldn’t be something that we just taught them.
00:02:06 We had to live our life of service to Jehovah with them.
00:02:12 Jesus said that obviously we ‘can’t slave for two masters.’
00:02:17 And I’ve tried to do that and, believe me, it does not work.
00:02:21 Like any father, I wanted to have a home for my family.
00:02:26 My profession was building houses,
00:02:29 but that cost me my pioneering.
00:02:32 And so I decided
00:02:35 I had to quit building houses.
00:02:37 So I did.
00:02:38 I started to do remodel jobs.
00:02:40 And we looked for a place that we could afford
00:02:43 that would sustain us in the full-time service,
00:02:46 and Jehovah provided exactly what we needed.
00:02:51 One of the highlights of raising the children
00:02:54 was the annual visits to unassigned territory.
00:02:57 The success in the ministry was phenomenal.
00:03:01 So we decided as a family
00:03:03 to take on the challenge of learning Spanish.
00:03:07 We had a large Spanish-speaking population
00:03:10 in our territory and in the surrounding territories,
00:03:13 and there was no group or congregation to help them.
00:03:18 When we would go out of the country to preach, we would often stay
00:03:23 with family members of our Bible students
00:03:25 or our brothers and sisters in these countries,
00:03:28 in some very humble surroundings,
00:03:31 and we took advantage
00:03:33 of the hospitality that they offered us
00:03:35 because we wanted to live the culture with them.
00:03:40 It just opened our eyes to a world that we never knew existed.
00:03:47 Our family was able to progress
00:03:52 and flourish spiritually
00:03:54 because of a concentrated effort by Joren and me.
00:03:58 She’s been there to fill in all of the cracks.
00:04:01 He always made it so easy to love him,
00:04:07 to love the children, and to really focus on spiritual things.
00:04:11 When we pray to Jehovah,
00:04:13 thinking about our family being able to serve him like this,
00:04:17 we just say thank you.
00:04:20 We just try in some way to express how deeply we feel
00:04:25 about this privilege that we have
00:04:27 to be with Kaarsten and Kjersti and Andrea and Dhimo.
00:04:32 We don’t deserve
00:04:34 any of these blessings from Jehovah,
00:04:36 but somehow he’s blessed our efforts,
00:04:41 and he’s given us an opportunity to smile
00:04:44 and reflect on all of the things that he’s done for us.
00:04:48 And what can we do to repay Jehovah
00:04:51 but just keep going, keep trying,
00:04:54 and keep moving forward until we’re on the other side?
