When a person makes a sacrifice,

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:06.026 line:10% position:50% align:center
they give up something

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:07.736 line:10% position:50% align:center
for something that they consider

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:09.113 line:10% position:50% align:center
is of higher value.

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of a price tag can you put

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your child’s love for Jehovah?

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of a price tag can you put

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
on serving Jehovah whole-souled as a family?

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:26.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I found out
that we were going to have a family,

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was overwhelming for me.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you come into the truth—

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
We weren’t Witnesses when I was a child.

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you’re exposed to things
that leave you with baggage,

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
leave you unsure of yourself.

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need constant reassurance
that you’re going to be OK,

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can take care
of any situation that comes along.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad—he gave me all I needed.

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:56.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loved me so much.

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would take my mother’s knitting yarn,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:02.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would tie it to his door handle
after he went to sleep.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I would run it
across the hall to my bedroom

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tie it to my big toe

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that when he opened
his door in the morning,

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:10.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would wake up 
and I could be with him.

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:14.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
That love that I had for my dad

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:17.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I wanted them to love Jehovah that much.

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted a string tied
around their hearts right to Jehovah

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he was the one motivating them

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was the one
waking them up spiritually every day.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved to teach the children things,

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would do it at any available moment.

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, of course,
at night, as a family

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:40.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
(usually on our bed),
we would read our Bible together.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the glue that kept us tied to Jehovah

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kept us tied to each other.

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Judges 7, Gideon said:

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:54.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Watch me and do . . . what I do.”

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I knew that if we wanted
the children to live the truth,

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:03.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to live it with them.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
It couldn’t be something
that we just taught them.

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:10.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to live our life of service
to Jehovah with them.

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:17.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that obviously
we ‘can’t slave for two masters.’

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:20.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ve tried to do that and, believe me,
it does not work.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:26.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like any father,
I wanted to have a home for my family.

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
My profession was building houses,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that cost me my pioneering.

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:35.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I decided

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to quit building houses.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I did.

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:40.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to do remodel jobs.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we looked for a place
that we could afford

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:46.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would sustain us
in the full-time service,

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:49.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah provided
exactly what we needed.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:54.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the highlights of raising the children

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:57.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the annual visits
to unassigned territory.

00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:01.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
The success in the ministry was phenomenal.

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:03.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we decided as a family

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:07.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take on the challenge of learning Spanish.

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:10.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a large Spanish-speaking population

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our territory
and in the surrounding territories,

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:17.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was no group
or congregation to help them.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we would go out
of the country to preach, we would often stay

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:25.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
with family members of our Bible students

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
or our brothers and sisters
in these countries,

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some very humble surroundings,

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:33.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we took advantage

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:35.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the hospitality that they offered us

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we wanted
to live the culture with them.

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:45.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just opened our eyes to a world
that we never knew existed.

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:52.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our family was able to progress

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:54.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and flourish spiritually

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of a concentrated effort
by Joren and me.

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s been there
to fill in all of the cracks.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always made it so easy to love him,

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love the children,
and to really focus on spiritual things.

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:13.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we pray to Jehovah,

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking about our family
being able to serve him like this,

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:20.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
we just say thank you.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just try in some way
to express how deeply we feel

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:27.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
about this privilege that we have

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:32.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be with Kaarsten and Kjersti
and Andrea and Dhimo.

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:34.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t deserve

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:36.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
any of these blessings from Jehovah,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
but somehow he’s blessed our efforts,

00:04:41.343 --> 00:04:44.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s given us an opportunity to smile

00:04:44.638 --> 00:04:48.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reflect on all of the things
that he’s done for us.

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what can we do to repay Jehovah

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just keep going, keep trying,

00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:57.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep moving forward
until we’re on the other side?
