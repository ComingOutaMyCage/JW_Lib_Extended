00:00:01.856 --> 00:00:03.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
 Hello there!

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:05.609 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s a pleasure to welcome you

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.611 line:10% position:50% align:center
to our program.

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:09.864 line:10% position:50% align:center
We have a few updates to share,

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:11.198 line:10% position:50% align:center
and then we’ll watch

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.242 line:10% position:50% align:center
an encouraging interview.

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re excited that two brothers
were recently released

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
from prison in Russia
after completing their sentences.

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:25.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
On July 19, 2023,

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
69-year-old Brother Yuriy Savelyev
was released.

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spent over four and a half years
behind bars.

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:40.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dozens of brothers and sisters
welcomed him outside the prison.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very happy for him

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his loved ones.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:47.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on July 26, 2023,

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:49.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Sergey Klimov

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
was released after some five years in prison.

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was warmly welcomed
by his family and friends.

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice with you all!

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said at Revelation 2:10:

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Devil will keep on throwing
some of you into prison.”

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus also said:
“Do not be afraid.” 

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:19.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> of July 2019 stated:

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When our enemies ban our worship,

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they hope to make us
afraid to serve Jehovah.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In addition to the ban,
they may circulate false stories,

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:34.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“send officials to search our homes,

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:38.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“drag us to court,
or even imprison some of us.

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:41.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They hope that we will be terrified

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they managed
to put a small number of us in prison.”

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:52.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, what do we learn
from these two dear brothers in Russia?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have successfully endured
their imprisonment

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have come out victorious.

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, Jesus was right

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:07.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he said we have no reason to be afraid.

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters around the world

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
are enjoying
the “Exercise Patience”! Convention.

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:21.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
For our young ones,
this may be the first convention

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ll remember attending in person.

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:26.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear from a few of them.

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today I’m happy
because I’m at the convention,

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I can see everybody again.

00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:45.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like being here at the convention
because I get to meet

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers and sisters that are here.

00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:50.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like taking pictures

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:52.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my new friends.

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:56.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m happy to be at the convention today

00:02:56.697 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I can hug my brothers and sisters.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:01.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I also like the songs.

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
They relax me a lot.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
I helped clean
with the friends in our congregation.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:09.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was fun.

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:13.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family and friends
are all here surrounding me,

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:15.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
loving Jehovah just like I do.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:19.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
To me, I like to be here
because I can see the videos

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also see all the brothers.

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
I definitely think
being in person is much better.

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learn lots more things

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t really focus on when I was at home.

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:32.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like coming to the convention

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:35.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
better than watching it on the TV.

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
What beautiful comments!

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:55.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so proud of all you parents.

00:03:55.756 --> 00:04:00.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
The effort you make
to bring your little ones to the convention

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:05.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us of what Joseph and Mary did.

00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:07.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Year after year,

00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:12.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
they brought Jesus and his siblings
to the festival in Jerusalem.

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was worth the effort!

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:20.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, you parents are giving
a beautiful gift to your children

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:23.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
by bringing them to the convention.

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:26.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
It must warm Jehovah’s heart

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:29.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see you all in attendance.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
On September 1, a new service year begins.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so does our worldwide campaign

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:45.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feature <i>The Watchtower</i>  No. 2 of 2020,

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:49.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “What Is God’s Kingdom?”

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:53.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Publishers who serve as auxiliary pioneers

00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:57.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
can choose a 15- or 30-hour requirement.

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:02.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need the Kingdom more than ever before!

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:05.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a joy for us to share

00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:07.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
this vital message with our neighbors.

00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:12.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many congregations will soon be informed

00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the dates
for the 2024 regional conventions.

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:21.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re pleased to inform you that the theme

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:25.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 2024 convention program is

00:05:25.304 --> 00:05:28.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Declare the Good News!”

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:32.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is based on 1 Corinthians 9:16,

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:34.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says:

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:37.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now if I am declaring the good news,

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:41.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is no reason for me to boast,

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:45.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for necessity is laid upon me.

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:47.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Really, woe to me

00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:51.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
if I do not declare the good news!”

00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:54.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
With so much bad news today,

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:59.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know you’ll enjoy all three days
of this thrilling convention

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:03.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the very first word on Friday.

00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:06.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of good news,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
we rejoiced when 28
of our dear brothers and sisters

00:06:11.058 --> 00:06:14.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
were released from prison in Eritrea

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:17.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
on December 4, 2020.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had been in prison
for between 5 and 26 years!

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:27.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why were they imprisoned?

00:06:27.032 --> 00:06:29.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
For their Christian neutrality.

00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:33.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Negede Teklemariam

00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:35.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
was among those targeted

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:39.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
for taking a neutral stand.

00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:41.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1994,

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:45.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Negede was only 21 years old,

00:06:45.717 --> 00:06:49.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
soldiers abducted him from his home.

00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:52.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spent a total of 26 years in two prisons

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:56.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with Brothers Paulos Eyasu

00:06:56.103 --> 00:06:59.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Isaac Mogos.

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:03.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since their release from prison in 2020,

00:07:03.193 --> 00:07:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac was baptized

00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:10.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the three brothers
continue to serve Jehovah faithfully.

00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:15.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch
the following heartwarming interview,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s notice what helped Negede
to keep his integrity.

00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:25.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
On September 17, 1994, at about 1:00 a.m.,

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:27.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
three soldiers came and knocked on our gates.

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:31.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did not give me an opportunity
to speak or change my clothes.

00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:36.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother said to me:
“Take courage!

00:07:36.184 --> 00:07:38.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is with you.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as you remain loyal to him,
Jehovah will safeguard you.”

00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:46.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother kept repeating those words
as I was taken away.

00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:52.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sawa is a military training camp.

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:54.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a huge camp, and within the camp,

00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:56.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a little prison compound.

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:59.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s only for a lack of words
that we call it a prison.

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are no words for it.

00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:04.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a humane way
to treat another human being.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
The room,
which is made of corrugated metal sheets,

00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:10.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the day gets extremely hot.

00:08:10.594 --> 00:08:14.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no ventilation in the room—no bed.

00:08:14.014 --> 00:08:16.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
We slept on the ground.

00:08:16.183 --> 00:08:18.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Food provided by the government was meager

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:22.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
—bread, dry lentils, sometimes soup.

00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:26.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
In prison, we were tied with ropes
and endured cruel treatment by the guards,

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:29.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
extreme physical beatings, and forced labor.

00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:32.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made us work extra hard
in order to tire us out

00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:36.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we would give up
and do what they wanted us to do.

00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:40.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I found the most challenging
in the 23 years at Sawa

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:44.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that even to relieve yourself
of your natural body functions,

00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:46.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
you were not able to do it
when you needed to.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to get permission
to relieve ourselves,

00:08:49.174 --> 00:08:51.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was always a soldier
guarding and watching us

00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:53.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that is the worst kind of life.

00:08:53.762 --> 00:08:55.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never had a bathroom.

00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:58.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was never a hope
of one day being released,

00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:02.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
let alone even going to face a court
that would sentence us.

00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:05.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were just waiting for us to go insane

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to die
because of lack of medical treatment.

00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:11.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that helped me keep going
was the scripture

00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:14.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was the daily text
of the day I was arrested.

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:17.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture was John 16:33.

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:19.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
That scripture, in part, mentions:

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:23.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the world you will have tribulation,
but take courage!”

00:09:25.252 --> 00:09:27.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
This scripture
was a source of encouragement and comfort

00:09:27.796 --> 00:09:32.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to us prisoners but also to all
the brothers who were left behind.

00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:36.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
The soldiers took me to the wilderness

00:09:36.346 --> 00:09:38.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
and told me to dig a hole.

00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:40.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
They set before us two choices.

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:45.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said: “We have tried many things on you,
but you didn’t change.

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:48.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The government has decided to execute you.

00:09:48.066 --> 00:09:52.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Put on the military uniform
and be soldiers like the others,

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:54.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or if you continue saying

00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:57.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I belong to God’s Kingdom’
or ‘I belong to the heavenly Kingdom,’

00:09:57.868 --> 00:09:59.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will be put in this hole.”

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
They put me in the hole.

00:10:01.872 --> 00:10:05.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hole was deep enough
for only my neck to be above ground.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:08.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only is the strong daytime sun
beating on my head,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m buried in sand
that the sun has been beating on all day.

00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:16.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was sweating
and slowly starting to pass out.

00:10:16.636 --> 00:10:20.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a car with military personnel
traveling from a distance.

00:10:20.765 --> 00:10:24.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
They could see a body buried
with only his neck above the ground.

00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:29.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
This soldier was not from the military camp;
he was simply passing by.

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:31.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a high-ranking military official.

00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:36.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know him personally;
he didn’t know me.

00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:40.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
He asked the men:
“How did this even happen?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is that even allowed
—to do this to a human being?

00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:46.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who gave you the order to bury him alive?”

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:50.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing I and even those
who were with me learned from this is

00:10:50.462 --> 00:10:54.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when a person goes into prison,
he may feel like he is alone,

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:57.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as long as we stay faithful to Jehovah,

00:10:57.802 --> 00:10:59.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
we trust him to do something.

00:11:01.223 --> 00:11:04.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have seen the scripture
in Romans chapter 8 from verse 35 on

00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:06.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
being fulfilled in our case.

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:08.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah helped us.

00:11:08.772 --> 00:11:12.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly nothing can separate us from his love.

00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:29.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a lady and a gentleman
who were working in the prison

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:32.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the male was a guard,
and she was a secretary.

00:11:32.003 --> 00:11:34.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
They talked among themselves.

00:11:34.047 --> 00:11:37.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reasoned: “It looks like the government
is going to kill them.

00:11:37.634 --> 00:11:41.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why don’t we record what we see
and take their story outside?

00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:43.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At least we can say to their families,

00:11:43.348 --> 00:11:46.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They were here,
and this is what they looked like.’”

00:11:46.226 --> 00:11:48.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they decided to take a picture

00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:51.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
and show it to our families
and to the rest of the world.

00:11:52.607 --> 00:11:56.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see in the picture of Paulos
that his hands are full of mud.

00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:59.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the time,
we were doing manual labor outside,

00:11:59.948 --> 00:12:01.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
moving rocks and things.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want our family members
or our parents

00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:08.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
who saw the picture
to see us sad and dejected.

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:10.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, rather, we wanted them to know

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re happy to be persecuted for the Christ.

00:12:13.503 --> 00:12:16.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we made an effort to smile.

00:12:20.552 --> 00:12:22.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout our time in prison,

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:25.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
prayer was a tool
that really helped us through,

00:12:25.849 --> 00:12:27.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially in the first few years.

00:12:27.976 --> 00:12:32.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had no access to spiritual food
—no Bible, no publications.

00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:35.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only thing we had was prayer.

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:38.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
One specific thing
I remember praying early on

00:12:38.737 --> 00:12:42.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
was for Jehovah
to let us be free from prison.

00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:44.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as the years went by,

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:49.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
I personally changed my prayers to:
“Help me, Jehovah, to endure.

00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:53.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help me to be able to put up with
the inconveniences of prison life.”

00:13:13.438 --> 00:13:17.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never anticipated
I would be freed that day or that year.

00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:22.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to see that Jehovah can deliver
his people out of trialsome situations.

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:25.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anytime he chooses is the right time.

00:13:27.243 --> 00:13:31.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
From those 26 years,
I’ve learned lots of lessons.

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:34.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned that Jehovah
listens to our concerns.

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:37.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to be persecuted for his name’s sake

00:13:37.003 --> 00:13:40.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
is of greater reward than the inconveniences.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:44.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know what tomorrow will bring
and what might change,

00:13:44.302 --> 00:13:46.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
so there’s no good
that comes from being afraid

00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:48.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
of prison or being afraid of persecution.

00:13:49.432 --> 00:13:51.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can prepare for persecution.

00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:55.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will help us endure any trial.

00:13:55.814 --> 00:13:58.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just have to ask for his help.

00:13:58.233 --> 00:14:02.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever circumstances
(expected or unexpected) that arise,

00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:04.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is a lesson I learned:

00:14:04.698 --> 00:14:07.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will help us endure.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many individuals kept supporting us
through letters

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other supplies from everywhere.

00:14:12.497 --> 00:14:16.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tireless prayers of our brothers
and sisters throughout the world,

00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:20.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
even young ones who couldn’t even pronounce
our names but were praying for us,

00:14:20.964 --> 00:14:23.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthened us.

00:14:23.007 --> 00:14:26.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue praying,
because there are many others

00:14:26.302 --> 00:14:28.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are in various prisons now.

00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:51.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing
your experience with us, Negede.

00:14:52.245 --> 00:14:55.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so encouraging to hear

00:14:55.081 --> 00:14:58.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah sustained you

00:14:58.168 --> 00:15:01.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite such brutal treatment.

00:15:01.337 --> 00:15:04.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are an integrity keeper,

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:07.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love you very much!

00:15:08.845 --> 00:15:12.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know I’m not alone in saying

00:15:12.307 --> 00:15:16.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we supplicated Jehovah in your behalf

00:15:16.936 --> 00:15:20.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
many times over the course of the 26 years

00:15:20.815 --> 00:15:24.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you and the other brothers
were in prison.

00:15:24.652 --> 00:15:29.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we continue to pray
for the 32 brothers and sisters in Eritrea

00:15:29.657 --> 00:15:33.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are still imprisoned for their faith.

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:39.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some lessons that we can
take away from Negede’s interview?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Briefly, here are three:

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:47.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Read the daily text every day,

00:15:48.468 --> 00:15:53.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) rely on Jehovah in prayer,

00:15:54.057 --> 00:15:59.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) you can be joyful
despite persecution.

00:16:00.605 --> 00:16:05.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to inform you
that the full interview with Negede

00:16:05.568 --> 00:16:07.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be made available

00:16:07.904 --> 00:16:11.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org in the future.

00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:16.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we reflect on Negede’s endurance,

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:18.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re reminded of all those

00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:21.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are currently enduring persecution

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
or imprisonment for their faith.

00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:26.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
To you brothers and sisters

00:16:26.923 --> 00:16:30.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
enduring persecution in Eritrea, Russia,

00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:33.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in all other areas of the world,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are praying for you

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:39.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love you very much!

00:16:40.228 --> 00:16:43.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:16:43.356 --> 00:16:47.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
