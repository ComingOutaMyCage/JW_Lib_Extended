00:00:01 Welcome, brothers and sisters.
00:00:05 In this program, we’re going to discuss
00:00:07 the joy of in-person conventions.
00:00:10 But first, here are a few updates.
00:00:14 After nearly 20 years,
00:00:17 on April 26, 2023,
00:00:20 the government of Spain approved a historic adjustment
00:00:23 to the country’s tax exemption law.
00:00:27 This decision confirms that Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:30 are a well-known and respected religion in Spain.
00:00:35 In addition, the adjustment exempts our brothers
00:00:38 from having to pay property tax on theocratic facilities in the country.
00:00:43 It also allows individuals in Spain who support the work
00:00:46 to obtain a tax deduction on their contributions.
00:00:50 We’re very grateful for this positive development.
00:00:55 Also, as reported on jw.org,
00:00:58 we’re very pleased that on May 16, 2023,
00:01:03 Brother Shamil Khakimov was released from prison in Tajikistan
00:01:07 after fulfilling his prison sentence.
00:01:10 You might recall that he was first detained
00:01:12 in February 2019.
00:01:16 He spent over four years in prison for his faith.
00:01:21 He plans to get some much-needed rest
00:01:23 and is being helped  to receive necessary medical care.
00:01:27 We’re very happy for you, Brother Khakimov!
00:01:31 Your faithful endurance encourages all of us.
00:01:36 Of course, we continue to keep close in mind
00:01:39 the over 180 brothers and sisters
00:01:42 who are still imprisoned for their faith.
00:01:45 The apostle Paul wrote at Philippians 1:14:
00:01:50 “Now most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence
00:01:53 “because of my prison bonds,
00:01:56 “and they are showing all the more courage
00:01:59 to speak the word of God fearlessly.”
00:02:03 Just as first-century Christians
00:02:05 were encouraged by Paul’s faithful example,
00:02:08 the faith of those imprisoned in our day
00:02:11 impels us to share the Kingdom good news with zeal.
00:02:16 But can such faithful ones in prison
00:02:18 be sure of Jehovah’s blessing and protection?
00:02:24 Isaiah’s prophecy highlights what Jehovah promised
00:02:27 for his cleansed people.
00:02:29 Note Isaiah 4:5, 6.
00:02:36 It says: “Jehovah will also create
00:02:39 “over the whole site of Mount Zion
00:02:42 “and over the place of her conventions
00:02:44 “a cloud and smoke by day
00:02:46 “and a bright flaming fire by night;
00:02:49 “for over all the glory there will be a shelter.
00:02:53 “And there will be a booth for shade by day from the heat,
00:02:56 and for refuge and protection from storms and the rain.”
00:03:01 These verses highlight the spiritual protection
00:03:04 that Jehovah offered his servants in the past
00:03:06 and, by extension, to us today.
00:03:10 How so?
00:03:12 Verse 5 says that Jehovah will create
00:03:14 over his people “a cloud,” “smoke,” and “a bright flaming fire.”
00:03:19 These remind us of how Jehovah cared
00:03:22 for the Israelites after they left Egypt.
00:03:25 He used a “pillar of fire and cloud” to protect and to lead them.
00:03:30 No, Jehovah doesn’t promise us
00:03:33 miraculous physical protection;
00:03:35 nor does he prevent the heat of persecution
00:03:38 or storms of opposition from bearing down on us.
00:03:42 But as verse 6 explains,
00:03:44 he does protect us spiritually,
00:03:47 as if building ‘a booth for shade and for protection from the rainstorm.’
00:03:53 What’s the point?
00:03:55 Jehovah promises to be with his faithful servants
00:03:59 wherever they are
00:04:01 —even if they’re boxed in by four prison walls.
00:04:05 Jehovah is our Protector.
00:04:09 His holy spirit gives us joy and peace.
00:04:12 No human can tear down ‘the booth of protection’
00:04:15 that Jehovah builds.
00:04:18 As long as we maintain our integrity,
00:04:20 our future is secure.
00:04:24 Did you notice another place
00:04:26 where Jehovah’s cloud of spiritual protection is?
00:04:30 Verse 5 says it would be
00:04:32 ‘over the place of his servants’ conventions.’
00:04:35 We’re very excited that it’s convention season once again
00:04:39 —this time in person!
00:04:41 We’re eager to share in the invitation campaign
00:04:44 and thrilled to be together in person for conventions
00:04:48 for the first time since 2019.
00:04:52 Just last week, my wife and I received a letter from a sister
00:04:57 who will soon be attending the regional convention
00:04:59 and the Pioneer Service School.
00:05:01 She wrote:
00:05:04 “I usually wait to write to you until after the events,
00:05:07 “but this year, I did not want to delay in letting you know how happy,
00:05:11 “how excited, how spiritually blessed I know we will be
00:05:14 “after each of these special occasions.
00:05:18 “How do I know it will be perfect,
00:05:20 “just what we need at each event?
00:05:23 “Because of the track record.
00:05:26 “Jehovah’s hand is not short.
00:05:30 “Not once have we been disappointed or thinking,
00:05:33 “‘I wish for something else.’
00:05:35 Thank you.”
00:05:38 What an expression of faith!
00:05:42 This certainly is pleasing to our heavenly Father, Jehovah,
00:05:46 and to his Son, the head of the Christian congregation.
00:05:51 Over the years, convention arrangements have been simplified
00:05:55 so that we can focus more on the spiritual program.
00:05:59 For example, do you recall when meals were served at our conventions?
00:06:04 Arrangements varied globally.
00:06:07 But no doubt you’ll enjoy this brief report on how things were done
00:06:10 over the years in the United States.
00:06:14 In the United States, providing meals
00:06:16 for fellow convention attendees extends all the way
00:06:19 back to the 1890’s.
00:06:21 However, the sheer magnitude of the task
00:06:24 took on new dimensions in the 1940’s when the size of conventions grew.
00:06:29 Many volunteers were needed
00:06:31 to procure, receive, prepare, and serve
00:06:34 three hot meals a day to delegates.
00:06:39 An example of this was the eight-day
00:06:41 New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:06:44 held in Yankee Stadium in 1953.
00:06:48 Some 130,000 attended on average each day!
00:06:52 The cafeteria was operated
00:06:55 by 4,500 volunteers, with the capacity to provide
00:06:59 30,000 meals per hour.
00:07:01 Although food service volunteers were happy to work
00:07:04 in behalf of convention attendees,
00:07:06 they often worked many hours and heard very little
00:07:09 or none of the program and often had to attend a second convention to listen.
00:07:14 So in 1978,
00:07:16 food service operations were simplified in many places.
00:07:19 Instead of a cafeteria meal, refreshment stands
00:07:22 were used and featured a simplified menu.
00:07:25 This made it possible for the vast majority
00:07:28 of food service volunteers to hear the spiritual program.
00:07:31 Further simplifications were made in 1987
00:07:33 when hot food items were no longer provided,
00:07:36 thus eliminating the need for natural gas,
00:07:39 oven trailers, and the like.
00:07:40 For decades, meal tickets were available for purchase
00:07:44 and were exchanged for food items.
00:07:47 These tickets were designed so that no change was needed,
00:07:50 thus expediting the purchase of food.
00:07:54 Here’s a sample menu.
00:07:56 The menu showed how many tickets
00:07:57 were required to purchase each item.
00:08:01 Finally, in 1995,
00:08:02 arrangements for food service at conventions were discontinued.
00:08:07 Instead, delegates were encouraged to bring their own food
00:08:10 and enjoy association on location during the noon break.
00:08:15 As a result, we no longer need to wait in line,
00:08:18 we have more time to spend with friends on-site,
00:08:21 and this arrangement is easier for our older and infirm ones.
00:08:24 We continue to benefit from this simplified arrangement today.
00:08:32 So in order to enjoy association during the noon break,
00:08:36 we encourage everyone to bring a light lunch,
00:08:39 which will also help us to stay awake during the afternoon session.
00:08:45 As we return to in-person conventions,
00:08:48 perhaps we’ll feel like those from Eastern Europe
00:08:51 who attended international conventions in Poland in 1989.
00:08:55 That was the first convention ever for most of those delegates,
00:09:00 although many had been in the truth for 30 years or more.
00:09:04 One delegate from the former Soviet Union said:
00:09:10 “For many years we have been waiting for this day,
00:09:14 “and now we are here at this international convention.
00:09:18 “We find it difficult to grasp
00:09:20 “all of this and take it all in.
00:09:23 “It is like a dream.
00:09:25 “It is impossible to express in words everything we have seen and heard.
00:09:30 “When we saw the gigantic, bowl-shaped stadium full of people
00:09:34 “and heard the music, our eyes filled with tears.
00:09:39 “And the prayer
00:09:42 “—while all of us were motionlessly united—
00:09:45 “sent cold shivers down our backs.
00:09:48 “It was so solemn and unanimous.
00:09:53 “This convention in Warsaw is such a splendid
00:09:55 “and grand event that only the new world will be better.
00:09:58 “We will always remember these wonderful days.
00:10:01 “It is something one cannot forget.
00:10:04 “Special thanks and glory
00:10:07 be to our Creator, Jehovah God!”
00:10:10 The Awake!  of December 22, 1989, reported:
00:10:16 “The singing at the conventions was noteworthy,
00:10:19 “as tens of thousands sang in unison in over 20 different languages,
00:10:23 “all expressing the same thoughts
00:10:25 in a spirit of love and unity.”
00:10:31 As mentioned in the May broadcast,
00:10:34 we encourage you to learn the new original song,
00:10:37 “It Will Not Be Late!”
00:10:40 During the pandemic, we missed singing at large conventions.
00:10:44 This year, to quote Psalm 7:17,
00:10:48 we’ll again “sing praises to the name of Jehovah the Most High”
00:10:52 at our conventions!
00:10:54 I still remember attending conventions in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when I was a kid.
00:11:00 It was thrilling to hear Kingdom melodies
00:11:02 echoing in a large stadium
00:11:05 that had been converted into a house of worship.
00:11:08 Many of you will remember this stirring Kingdom melody from 1981.
00:11:40 Do you have similar  memories?
00:11:42 If you were baptized during the pandemic,
00:11:46 then this year’s convention will likely be your first in person.
00:11:50 You too will form memories that will last a lifetime.
00:11:55 That’s how many of our brothers and sisters felt
00:11:58 when they recently attended the “Exercise Patience”! Convention.
00:12:12 We’re here at the Newburgh, New York, “Exercise Patience”! Convention.
00:12:16 This is my first convention as a baptized Witness.
00:12:19 It’s a joy to be with our family today and get
00:12:22 the spiritual food that we need.
00:12:24 It’s clear that Jehovah’s people
00:12:25 haven’t forgotten how to laugh and hug each other
00:12:28 —love each other.
00:12:29 Being in person, being able to really hear everybody sing together,
00:12:33 talking with everybody in person is—
00:12:35 You just can’t beat it.
00:12:38 The singing is beautiful.
00:12:39 When we were doing it on Zoom, you didn’t hear the voices.
00:12:42 So to see all the voices singing together,
00:12:45 the harmony, is just—  You feel it more.
00:12:49 The theme “Exercise Patience!” is a great theme
00:12:52 because that’s something that we don’t have today in this world.
00:12:55 It seems like what’s presented matches exactly what we’re dealing with
00:12:59 in our lives and what we see happening in the world.
00:13:02 It’s phenomenal the way that you could follow along
00:13:04 and how it makes the Bible so much easier to understand.
00:13:08 All the videos and meeting new friends
00:13:10 and seeing even my old friends that I haven’t seen in a while—
00:13:13 I love that you can sit and have a meal
00:13:15 with someone you’ve never met before  and you have something in common.
00:13:18 You can talk about the program,
00:13:20 and by the end of the meal, you’ve become great friends.
00:13:24 To get our family ready for a convention
00:13:28 is a lot of work as a mom.
00:13:31 But conventions draw us closer as families
00:13:34 because we’re all worshipping Jehovah together.
00:13:38 For someone who’s never been to a convention before,
00:13:42 I’d tell them that the experience is going to change their life.
00:13:45 They’re going to see and feel a different type of love
00:13:48 that they probably never felt before.
00:13:50 Now being here together and seeing them in person,
00:13:53 it’s a different feel.
00:13:54 It’s so beautiful.
00:13:56 You get together with so many people —so loving.
00:13:59 It’s almost like a taste of the Paradise right here, right now.
00:14:04 You are going to love this year’s convention!
00:14:09 Did any of the photos in our update
00:14:11 make you think about special conventions?
00:14:14 When are the next ones planned?
00:14:17 We’re pleased to inform you that 15 special conventions
00:14:21 in countries around the world are being planned for 2024!
00:14:26 The locations and dates will be announced in the coming months.
00:14:31 So, what have we discussed in this update?
00:14:35 We’re reminded that Jehovah is our Protector.
00:14:40 But this doesn’t mean we’ll have a problem-free life in this system of things.
00:14:45 However, when we face challenges,
00:14:47 we know that Jehovah is with us.
00:14:52 He protects us spiritually
00:14:54 and provides “the power beyond what is normal”
00:14:56 so we can endure trials faithfully.
00:15:01 And we’re very excited for our “Exercise Patience”! Regional Conventions!
00:15:06 May Jehovah bless the invitation campaign
00:15:09 and your efforts to attend all three days in person!
00:15:16 As Paul wrote to Timothy in his first letter, chapter 1, verse 2:
00:15:21 “May you have undeserved kindness and mercy and peace
00:15:26 from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.”
00:15:30 We love you all very much!
