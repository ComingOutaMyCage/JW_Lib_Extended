00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.316 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:07.152 line:10% position:50% align:center
In this program, we’re going to discuss

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:10.072 line:10% position:50% align:center
the joy of in-person conventions.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, here are a few updates.

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
After nearly 20 years,

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
on April 26, 2023,

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:23.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
the government of Spain
approved a historic adjustment

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the country’s tax exemption law.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
This decision confirms
that Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:35.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
are a well-known and respected religion
in Spain.

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:38.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition,
the adjustment exempts our brothers

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
from having to pay property tax
on theocratic facilities in the country.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:46.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also allows individuals in Spain
who support the work

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
to obtain a tax deduction
on their contributions.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:54.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very grateful
for this positive development.

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, as reported on jw.org,

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:03.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re very pleased that on May 16, 2023,

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Shamil Khakimov was released
from prison in Tajikistan

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:09.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
after fulfilling his prison sentence.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might recall that he was first detained

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:15.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
in February 2019.

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spent over four years in prison
for his faith.

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
He plans to get some much-needed rest

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is being helped 
to receive necessary medical care.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very happy for you, Brother Khakimov!

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your faithful endurance encourages all of us.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we continue to keep close in mind

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
the over 180 brothers and sisters

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are still imprisoned for their faith.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:49.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul wrote at Philippians 1:14:

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now most of the brothers in the Lord
have gained confidence

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:56.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of my prison bonds,

00:01:56.553 --> 00:01:59.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they are showing all the more courage

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak the word of God fearlessly.”

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:05.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as first-century Christians

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
were encouraged by Paul’s faithful example,

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
the faith of those imprisoned in our day

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:15.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
impels us to share the Kingdom good news
with zeal.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
But can such faithful ones in prison

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
be sure of Jehovah’s blessing and protection?

00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah’s prophecy highlights
what Jehovah promised

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his cleansed people.

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note Isaiah 4:5, 6.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Jehovah will also create

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“over the whole site of Mount Zion

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:44.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and over the place of her conventions

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:46.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a cloud and smoke by day

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a bright flaming fire by night;

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:53.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for over all the glory
there will be a shelter.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And there will be a booth for shade
by day from the heat,

00:02:56.655 --> 00:03:00.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for refuge and protection
from storms and the rain.”

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:04.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
These verses highlight
the spiritual protection

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah offered his servants in the past

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, by extension, to us today.

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 5 says that Jehovah will create

00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:19.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
over his people “a cloud,” “smoke,”
and “a bright flaming fire.”

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
These remind us of how Jehovah cared

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Israelites after they left Egypt.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used a “pillar of fire and cloud”
to protect and to lead them.

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:33.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah doesn’t promise us

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:35.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
miraculous physical protection;

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor does he prevent the heat of persecution

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:41.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
or storms of opposition
from bearing down on us.

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:44.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as verse 6 explains,

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
he does protect us spiritually,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if building ‘a booth for shade
and for protection from the rainstorm.’

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:55.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:59.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises to be
with his faithful servants

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:01.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever they are

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even if they’re boxed in
by four prison walls.

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is our Protector.

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
His holy spirit gives us joy and peace.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:15.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
No human can tear down
‘the booth of protection’

00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah builds.

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:20.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as we maintain our integrity,

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:23.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
our future is secure.

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:26.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice another place

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah’s cloud
of spiritual protection is?

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:32.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 5 says it would be

00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:35.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘over the place
of his servants’ conventions.’

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very excited
that it’s convention season once again

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:41.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this time in person!

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:44.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re eager to share
in the invitation campaign

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:48.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thrilled to be together
in person for conventions

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:51.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the first time since 2019.

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just last week, my wife and I received
a letter from a sister

00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will soon be attending
the regional convention

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:01.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Pioneer Service School.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
She wrote:

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:07.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I usually wait to write to you
until after the events,

00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:11.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but this year, I did not want to delay
in letting you know how happy,

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:14.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“how excited, how spiritually blessed
I know we will be

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:18.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after each of these special occasions.

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:20.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How do I know it will be perfect,

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:23.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just what we need at each event?

00:05:23.844 --> 00:05:26.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because of the track record.

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:30.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s hand is not short.

00:05:30.392 --> 00:05:33.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not once have we
been disappointed or thinking,

00:05:33.478 --> 00:05:35.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I wish for something else.’

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:37.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.”

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:42.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an expression of faith!

00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:46.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
This certainly is pleasing
to our heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:05:46.283 --> 00:05:49.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to his Son,
the head of the Christian congregation.

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:55.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the years, convention arrangements
have been simplified

00:05:55.584 --> 00:05:59.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can focus more
on the spiritual program.

00:05:59.963 --> 00:06:04.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, do you recall when meals
were served at our conventions?

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Arrangements varied globally.

00:06:07.012 --> 00:06:10.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no doubt you’ll enjoy this brief report
on how things were done

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:12.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the years in the United States.

00:06:14.603 --> 00:06:16.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the United States, providing meals

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
for fellow convention attendees
extends all the way

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
back to the 1890’s.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the sheer magnitude of the task

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
took on new dimensions in the 1940’s
when the size of conventions grew.

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:31.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many volunteers were needed

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
to procure, receive, prepare, and serve 

00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:36.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
three hot meals a day to delegates.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
An example of this was the eight-day

00:06:41.463 --> 00:06:44.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
New World Society Assembly
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:47.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
held in Yankee Stadium in 1953.

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:52.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some 130,000 attended on average each day!

00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:55.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cafeteria was operated

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:59.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
by 4,500 volunteers,
with the capacity to provide

00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:01.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
30,000 meals per hour.

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:04.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although food service volunteers
were happy to work

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
in behalf of convention attendees,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
they often worked many hours
and heard very little

00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:13.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
or none of the program and often had
to attend a second convention to listen.

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:16.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in 1978,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
food service operations
were simplified in many places.

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:22.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of a cafeteria meal,
refreshment stands

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
were used and featured a simplified menu.

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:28.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made it possible for the vast majority

00:07:28.135 --> 00:07:31.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
of food service volunteers
to hear the spiritual program.

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further simplifications were made in 1987

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
when hot food items were no longer provided,

00:07:36.393 --> 00:07:39.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
thus eliminating the need for natural gas,

00:07:39.062 --> 00:07:40.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
oven trailers, and the like.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:44.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
For decades, meal tickets
were available for purchase

00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:47.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
and were exchanged for food items.

00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:50.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
These tickets were designed
so that no change was needed,

00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:52.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
thus expediting the purchase of food.

00:07:54.244 --> 00:07:56.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a sample menu.

00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:57.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
The menu showed how many tickets

00:07:57.956 --> 00:08:00.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
were required to purchase each item.

00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:02.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, in 1995,

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:06.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
arrangements for food service
at conventions were discontinued.

00:08:07.632 --> 00:08:10.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, delegates were encouraged
to bring their own food

00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:13.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy association on location
during the noon break.

00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:18.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
we no longer need to wait in line,

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:21.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have more time to spend
with friends on-site,

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:24.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this arrangement is easier
for our older and infirm ones.

00:08:24.983 --> 00:08:28.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to benefit
from this simplified arrangement today.

00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:36.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in order to enjoy association
during the noon break,

00:08:36.036 --> 00:08:39.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
we encourage everyone to bring a light lunch,

00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:43.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will also help us to stay awake
during the afternoon session.

00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:48.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we return to in-person conventions,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps we’ll feel like those
from Eastern Europe

00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:55.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
who attended international conventions
in Poland in 1989.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:09:00.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the first convention ever
for most of those delegates,

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
although many had been in the truth
for 30 years or more.

00:09:04.773 --> 00:09:08.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
One delegate
from the former Soviet Union said:

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:14.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For many years
we have been waiting for this day,

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:18.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and now we are here
at this international convention.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We find it difficult to grasp

00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:23.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all of this and take it all in.

00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:25.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is like a dream.

00:09:25.377 --> 00:09:30.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is impossible to express in words
everything we have seen and heard.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When we saw the gigantic,
bowl-shaped stadium full of people

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:39.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and heard the music,
our eyes filled with tears.

00:09:39.683 --> 00:09:42.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the prayer

00:09:42.102 --> 00:09:45.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—while all of us were motionlessly united—

00:09:45.647 --> 00:09:48.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sent cold shivers down our backs.

00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:51.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was so solemn and unanimous.

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:55.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This convention in Warsaw is such a splendid

00:09:55.782 --> 00:09:58.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and grand event
that only the new world will be better.

00:09:58.743 --> 00:10:01.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will always remember
these wonderful days.

00:10:01.955 --> 00:10:04.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is something one cannot forget.

00:10:04.416 --> 00:10:07.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Special thanks and glory

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
be to our Creator, Jehovah God!”

00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:14.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Awake!</i>  of December 22, 1989, reported:

00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:19.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The singing at the conventions
was noteworthy,

00:10:19.264 --> 00:10:23.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as tens of thousands sang in unison
in over 20 different languages,

00:10:23.768 --> 00:10:25.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all expressing the same thoughts

00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:29.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a spirit of love and unity.”

00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:34.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
As mentioned in the May broadcast,

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:37.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
we encourage you to learn
the new original song,

00:10:37.532 --> 00:10:39.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It Will Not Be Late!”

00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:44.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic,
we missed singing at large conventions.

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:48.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year, to quote Psalm 7:17,

00:10:48.126 --> 00:10:52.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll again “sing praises to the name
of Jehovah the Most High”

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:54.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
at our conventions!

00:10:54.925 --> 00:10:59.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still remember attending conventions in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when I was a kid.

00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:02.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was thrilling to hear Kingdom melodies

00:11:02.849 --> 00:11:05.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
echoing in a large stadium

00:11:05.268 --> 00:11:08.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had been converted
into a house of worship.

00:11:08.605 --> 00:11:13.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of you will remember this stirring
Kingdom melody from 1981.

00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:42.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have similar  memories?

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:46.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were baptized during the pandemic,

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:50.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
then this year’s convention
will likely be your first in person.

00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:54.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too will form memories
that will last a lifetime.

00:11:55.777 --> 00:11:58.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how many
of our brothers and sisters felt

00:11:58.196 --> 00:12:02.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they recently attended
the “Exercise Patience”! Convention.

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:16.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re here at the Newburgh, New York,
“Exercise Patience”! Convention.

00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:19.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my first convention
as a baptized Witness.

00:12:19.217 --> 00:12:22.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a joy to be
with our family today and get

00:12:22.012 --> 00:12:24.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spiritual food that we need.

00:12:24.014 --> 00:12:25.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s clear that Jehovah’s people

00:12:25.974 --> 00:12:28.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
haven’t forgotten
how to laugh and hug each other

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
—love each other.

00:12:29.644 --> 00:12:33.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being in person, being able
to really hear everybody sing together,

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:35.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
talking with everybody in person is—

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:38.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just can’t beat it.

00:12:38.153 --> 00:12:39.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
The singing is beautiful.

00:12:39.988 --> 00:12:42.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we were doing it on Zoom,
you didn’t hear the voices.

00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:45.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to see all the voices singing together,

00:12:45.118 --> 00:12:47.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
the harmony, is just— 
You feel it more.

00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:52.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
The theme “Exercise Patience!”
is a great theme

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:55.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that’s something
that we don’t have today in this world.

00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:59.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems like what’s presented matches
exactly what we’re dealing with

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:01.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our lives and what we see happening
in the world.

00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:04.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s phenomenal the way that you
could follow along

00:13:04.888 --> 00:13:08.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it makes the Bible
so much easier to understand.

00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:10.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the videos and meeting new friends

00:13:10.852 --> 00:13:13.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing even my old friends
that I haven’t seen in a while—

00:13:13.605 --> 00:13:15.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love that you can sit and have a meal 

00:13:15.774 --> 00:13:18.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
with someone you’ve never met before 
and you have something in common.

00:13:18.902 --> 00:13:20.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can talk about the program,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by the end
of the meal, you’ve become great friends.

00:13:24.616 --> 00:13:27.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
To get our family ready for a convention

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a lot of work as a mom.

00:13:31.706 --> 00:13:34.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
But conventions draw us closer as families

00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:38.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we’re all
worshipping Jehovah together.

00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:42.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
For someone who’s never been
to a convention before,

00:13:42.175 --> 00:13:45.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d tell them that the experience
is going to change their life.

00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:48.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re going to see and feel
a different type of love

00:13:48.473 --> 00:13:50.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they probably never felt before.

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:53.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now being here together
and seeing them in person,

00:13:53.645 --> 00:13:54.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a different feel.

00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:56.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so beautiful.

00:13:56.106 --> 00:13:59.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
You get together with so many people
—so loving. 

00:13:59.275 --> 00:14:02.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s almost like a taste of the Paradise
right here, right now.

00:14:04.322 --> 00:14:07.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are going to love this year’s convention!

00:14:09.285 --> 00:14:11.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did any of the photos in our update

00:14:11.454 --> 00:14:14.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
make you think about special conventions?

00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:17.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
When are the next ones planned?

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:21.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re pleased to inform you
that 15 special conventions

00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:26.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
in countries around the world
are being planned for 2024!

00:14:26.594 --> 00:14:30.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
The locations and dates
will be announced in the coming months.

00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:35.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we discussed in this update?

00:14:35.437 --> 00:14:40.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re reminded that Jehovah is our Protector.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this doesn’t mean we’ll have
a problem-free life in this system of things.

00:14:45.321 --> 00:14:47.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when we face challenges,

00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:52.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that Jehovah is with us.

00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:54.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
He protects us spiritually

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provides
“the power beyond what is normal”

00:14:56.875 --> 00:15:00.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we can endure trials faithfully.

00:15:01.463 --> 00:15:06.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re very excited for our
“Exercise Patience”! Regional Conventions!

00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:09.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah bless the invitation campaign

00:15:09.888 --> 00:15:14.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your efforts to attend
all three days in person!

00:15:16.352 --> 00:15:21.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Paul wrote to Timothy
in his first letter, chapter 1, verse 2:

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:26.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May you have undeserved kindness
and mercy and peace

00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:30.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you all very much!

00:15:34.037 --> 00:15:36.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:15:36.498 --> 00:15:39.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
