00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:03.983 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome to our update!

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:07.236 line:10% position:50% align:center
The spiritual highlight of our year,

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:09.238 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Memorial of Christ’s death,

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:14.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
was observed
by God’s people on April 4, 2023.

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:17.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the weeks prior,
Jehovah’s Witnesses unitedly extended

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:21.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
the invitation to this event the world over.

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the first time
since the pandemic began

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:28.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we could again offer
invitations for the Memorial

00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:31.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of the house-to-house
and public ministry.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt many have been able to expand
their ministry during this Memorial season,

00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:40.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
including those who could serve
as auxiliary pioneers

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:42.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the new 15-hour requirement.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s thrilling to think about the millions

00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:50.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
of brothers and sisters and interested ones
who gathered for the Memorial

00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show their appreciation
for the gift of the ransom.

00:00:56.205 --> 00:01:00.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we face unexpected events or loss,

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:04.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are especially reminded
of how vital the ransom is.

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:09.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a brotherhood,
we were shocked to hear about the shooting

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
that occurred
at a Kingdom Hall in Hamburg, Germany,

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:14.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
in March 2023.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please note the following video update.

00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:22.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the evening of Thursday, March 9, 2023,

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:26.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
a terrible tragedy
happened in Hamburg, Germany,

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:29.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the midweek meeting concluded.

00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:33.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, four brothers and two sisters

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as an injured sister’s
unborn child were killed.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:42.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, two brothers
and seven sisters were seriously injured.

00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:47.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy to report
that none of them are in intensive care.

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:50.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following the shooting,

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:54.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
direction was given
that all meetings in Hamburg

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be held by videoconference only.

00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:00.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Hamburg-Winterhude Congregation

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:02.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
deeply desired to come together again

00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:05.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
for in-person meetings as soon as possible.

00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:09.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly thereafter,
approval was given for all meetings

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:14.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
to resume in person starting
with the very next midweek meeting.

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:17.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the injured
were even able to join the meeting

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the hospital, using Zoom.

00:02:20.378 --> 00:02:22.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Central Europe Branch Committee

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
made immediate arrangements
to give comfort and support.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
To bolster the relief committee
which had been appointed,

00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:34.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Branch Committee members
and their wives traveled to Hamburg

00:02:34.268 --> 00:02:36.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and accompanied
the responsible circuit overseer.

00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:41.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Special meetings were organized
to coordinate visits

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:43.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the affected brothers and sisters,

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
which often meant staying at their side
literally day and night.

00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:51.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day,
a tremendous number of letters and cards

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:55.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all over the world
continue to be delivered to the hall.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters are completely
overwhelmed and deeply touched

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:03.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
by these expressions
of affection and fellow feeling.

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:08.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
All congregations within the state of Hamburg

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
were invited to a memorial service

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:15.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
held on Saturday, March 25, 2023.

00:03:15.603 --> 00:03:19.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 3,000 brothers and sisters
attended in person,

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:24.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 90,000 connections
were made to view this program via stream,

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:28.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of whom viewed the program
with friends and family.

00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:32.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
All in attendance
were touched by the heartwarming words

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Branch Committee members

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:38.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as the visiting
Governing Body member and helper.

00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:43.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
This memorial service provided
strong evidence of Christian love

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:47.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a convincing testimony that Jehovah’s people

00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:50.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not face such situations alone.

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers in Hamburg
have experienced Jehovah’s loyal love

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout this very distressing situation.

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:04.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
After attending the funeral,
one sister wrote:

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The commemoration for the victims in Hamburg

00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:11.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was most dignified and deeply moving.

00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:13.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The profound Biblical thoughts,

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:15.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the unadulterated truth,

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:20.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the message of comfort,
love, trust, and hope

00:04:20.172 --> 00:04:24.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“delivered with such dignity,
tenderness, and empathy

00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“cannot but have moved every sincere heart

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:32.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has given a resounding witness
for our wonderful God, Jehovah.”

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:37.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have also received
many expressions of sympathy from officials,

00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:41.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
organizations, and individuals
from around the world.

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:45.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
the Federal President of Germany said:

00:04:45.407 --> 00:04:47.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To all of you dear bereaved,

00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:51.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“dear friends and companions of the victims,

00:04:51.163 --> 00:04:54.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“my sincere and deepest sympathy.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have the sympathy
of the people of Germany.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They feel and mourn with you.

00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:02.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
They share in your suffering.”

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:05.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt we all continue

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:09.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep our brothers and sisters
in Hamburg in our prayers.

00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:14.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another recent event
that’s had a significant impact

00:05:14.896 --> 00:05:17.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our brothers and sisters
was Cyclone Freddy,

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
which struck East Africa.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
In February and March 2023,

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:26.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cyclone Freddy made multiple landfalls

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:30.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brought strong winds,
heavy rain, and flooding.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, in Malawi,

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:37.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
eight publishers were killed
and three are currently missing.

00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:42.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in Mozambique,
one publisher was killed and one is missing.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:47.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s extensive damage in Madagascar,
Malawi, and Mozambique.

00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:53.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Altogether, over 7,000 publishers
and their households were displaced.

00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:59.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 1,400 of our brothers’ homes
were damaged or destroyed,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 24 Kingdom Halls
were damaged or destroyed.

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:07.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Branch Committees,
circuit overseers, and local elders

00:06:07.202 --> 00:06:11.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
responded quickly
to provide comfort and support

00:06:11.206 --> 00:06:14.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with help
for their immediate material needs.

00:06:14.793 --> 00:06:19.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Relief efforts are under way
to provide humanitarian aid

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to repair or rebuild
their Kingdom Halls and homes.

00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:28.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may well be the largest relief effort
that our brothers in Malawi have faced.

00:06:29.517 --> 00:06:33.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please keep these
dear brothers and sisters in your prayers

00:06:33.063 --> 00:06:36.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with those
who are working hard to provide relief.

00:06:39.486 --> 00:06:42.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we face trials or tragedies,

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:45.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are not the only ones who are affected.

00:06:45.534 --> 00:06:48.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 63:9, it says of Jehovah:

00:06:48.913 --> 00:06:53.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During all their distress
it was distressing to him.”

00:06:54.294 --> 00:06:58.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
This assures us that Jehovah is affected too.

00:06:58.006 --> 00:07:01.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s moved to help his faithful servants.

00:07:01.593 --> 00:07:06.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
And especially during times of distress,
he can become our refuge.

00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:09.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stands ready to help us.

00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:13.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can we benefit
from his help and protection?

00:07:13.064 --> 00:07:14.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the answer can be found

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what we read at Psalm 91:9.

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:21.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Because you said:

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:24.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Jehovah is my refuge,’

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have made the Most High your dwelling.”

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t just say
that “Jehovah is [our] refuge,”

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that we have made him our refuge.

00:07:35.296 --> 00:07:37.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can make Jehovah our refuge

00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:40.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
by drawing close to him during our trials.

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:41.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:07:42.303 --> 00:07:45.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
We lean on him in prayer,

00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:48.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
we keep up our good spiritual routine,

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:51.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
we stay busy in the ministry,

00:07:51.813 --> 00:07:55.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we look for ways to encourage others.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:58.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do this as individuals,

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:01.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
we make Jehovah our refuge.

00:08:01.657 --> 00:08:05.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, even when we do suffer tragedies
of one sort or another,

00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:10.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
our faith and our spiritual security
will not be destroyed.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do this as a brotherhood

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when we all turn to Jehovah
in times of distress—

00:08:16.214 --> 00:08:19.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
it unites us further.

00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:22.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it gives a wonderful witness.

00:08:24.348 --> 00:08:27.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
An example of this is
what our brothers experienced

00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:30.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Abaco Island in the Bahamas.

00:08:30.104 --> 00:08:34.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2019,
they suffered a Category 5 hurricane.

00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:38.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hurricane Dorian destroyed
the only Kingdom Hall on the island

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and damaged or destroyed
16 of our brothers’ homes.

00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:45.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did our brothers do?

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made Jehovah their refuge.

00:08:48.707 --> 00:08:51.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
They relied on him in fervent prayer.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:55.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
They supported one another
through that trial.

00:08:55.297 --> 00:08:59.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as soon as it was safe to do so,
the Kingdom Hall was rebuilt.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, the Kingdom Hall was completed

00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:07.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then dedicated in January 2023.

00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:10.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch the following video.

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:15.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sun is shining—not a cloud in the sky.

00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:17.988 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re in Abaco to dedicate

00:09:17.988 --> 00:09:19.990 line:10% position:50% align:center
this beautiful Kingdom Hall right here.

00:09:22.242 --> 00:09:24.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t wait to be a part of this

00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:25.704 line:10% position:50% align:center
and see this and be able to sing

00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:26.914 line:10% position:50% align:center
with my brothers and sisters

00:09:26.914 --> 00:09:28.124 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the Abaco Congregation

00:09:28.124 --> 00:09:29.417 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the Haitian Congregation

00:09:29.417 --> 00:09:31.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be able to hear our voices blend.

00:09:34.506 --> 00:09:36.508 line:10% position:50% align:center
But what a blessing from Jehovah

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:38.176 line:10% position:50% align:center
that finally we can be here

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:39.803 line:10% position:50% align:center
for this wonderful program!

00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:50.439 line:10% position:50% align:center
Here we are, three years later.

00:09:50.439 --> 00:09:52.525 line:10% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t think that this day

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:53.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
would actually come.

00:09:58.322 --> 00:10:00.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
I received a text message—I was at home—

00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:05.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pray for Abaco.”

00:10:09.668 --> 00:10:12.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
The devastation
to the Kingdom Hall was so complete

00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:16.008 line:10% position:50% align:center
that I think it is forever etched in my mind.

00:10:16.008 --> 00:10:19.220 line:10% position:50% align:center
You could see the Kingdom Hall chairs

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our publications thrown all around.

00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:24.142 line:10% position:50% align:center
It rips your heart apart

00:10:24.142 --> 00:10:25.560 line:10% position:50% align:center
to see the Kingdom Hall like that.

00:10:37.656 --> 00:10:40.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got to the airport,

00:10:40.284 --> 00:10:43.495 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it looked like

00:10:43.495 --> 00:10:46.999 line:10% position:50% align:center
there was no way out of this situation.

00:10:46.999 --> 00:10:49.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the brother prayed,

00:10:49.836 --> 00:10:52.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
and after he prayed,

00:10:52.046 --> 00:10:54.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was like a window opened

00:10:54.048 --> 00:10:56.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to get out of there.

00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:58.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got to Nassau.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was food; there was clothing.

00:11:01.097 --> 00:11:02.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a—

00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:04.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seemed like we were
having a convention where we landed.

00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:07.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were
so many brothers there with placards,

00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:09.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
singing at the top of their voice.

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:24.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
The operation was huge.

00:11:24.164 --> 00:11:27.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
We almost had about 70 or 80 individuals
that came in and out.

00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:28.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a mini army as it were.

00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:33.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were a few weeks away
from what was going to be the fastest

00:11:33.382 --> 00:11:34.883 line:10% position:50% align:center
project I’ve ever worked on.

00:11:34.883 --> 00:11:36.385 line:10% position:50% align:center
We were just absolutely

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:40.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
finishing houses at almost record speed.

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:43.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom Hall
was about to be ready for the Memorial.

00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:46.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we could start to see the end,

00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:49.149 line:10% position:50% align:center
and then we got the call that COVID

00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:51.276 line:10% position:50% align:center
was putting an end to the project.

00:11:51.276 --> 00:11:53.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our overseer got on stage,

00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:55.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
and within three or four words,
he started crying.

00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:58.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean,
we knew it was because we had to leave.

00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:04.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sitting on that plane made me cry,
thinking, ‘I am just leaving.’

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
We kept thinking,
‘When we will be able to go back?’

00:12:17.011 --> 00:12:19.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got the phone call from my overseer

00:12:19.723 --> 00:12:24.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they wanted to get Abaco finished up,
and I was thrilled.

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:27.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was praying for that for 15 months
—to go back and finish this project.

00:12:33.612 --> 00:12:35.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
When that hurricane blew through,

00:12:35.281 --> 00:12:38.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may have taken a lot of things with it,
but it sure didn’t take your faith.

00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:41.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it sure didn’t take away
your relationship with God.

00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:45.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got to Nassau,

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:49.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
the friends sang “Unfailing Love” to us.

00:12:49.546 --> 00:12:52.341 line:10% position:50% align:center
And so now they landed,

00:12:52.341 --> 00:12:54.593 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we sang it to them.

00:13:03.227 --> 00:13:06.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was overwhelming to listen and hear

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.315 line:10% position:50% align:center
the beautiful voices

00:13:07.315 --> 00:13:08.733 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the brothers and sisters

00:13:08.733 --> 00:13:10.735 line:10% position:50% align:center
singing about the love that we have

00:13:10.735 --> 00:13:12.362 line:10% position:50% align:center
among all of us.

00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:22.206 line:10% position:50% align:center
To have seen

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:26.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the friends went through
and how their hearts can be soothed—

00:13:26.293 --> 00:13:27.712 line:10% position:50% align:center
To have a place of worship

00:13:27.712 --> 00:13:29.589 line:10% position:50% align:center
is such a wonderful privilege.

00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:32.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a joy to be back at the hall,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it felt
like we were victorious once again.

00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:40.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t matter if there are
10 publishers or 10,000 publishers,

00:13:40.725 --> 00:13:42.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is going to take care of them.

00:13:42.811 --> 00:13:45.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has been a reunion,

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:47.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
a piece of Paradise.

00:13:52.112 --> 00:13:54.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what happens to us,

00:13:54.115 --> 00:13:57.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it be
a natural disaster or unrest or war,

00:13:57.243 --> 00:13:59.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re always going to be
there for our brothers.

00:13:59.787 --> 00:14:03.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to support one another,
we’re going to help each other,

00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:06.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to be OK with Jehovah’s help.

00:14:13.927 --> 00:14:17.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so encouraging
to see our brothers and sisters

00:14:17.097 --> 00:14:19.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
back in their Kingdom Hall!

00:14:19.433 --> 00:14:24.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their love and appreciation
for Jehovah and his organization is evident,

00:14:24.188 --> 00:14:27.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re making good use
of their Kingdom Hall.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this year’s Memorial,

00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:32.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
the 47 publishers of the two congregations

00:14:32.155 --> 00:14:36.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a combined attendance of 217.

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:39.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we conclude,

00:14:39.871 --> 00:14:44.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a new feature in <i> JW Library®</i>
 that we’re excited to share with you. 

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:47.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>JW Library </i> will soon support

00:14:47.797 --> 00:14:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Playlists in the Personal Study tab.

00:14:50.967 --> 00:14:52.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this feature,

00:14:52.176 --> 00:14:54.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll be able to add videos,

00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:55.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
audio programs,

00:14:55.388 --> 00:14:57.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pictures to personal playlists.

00:14:57.932 --> 00:14:59.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you can make playlists

00:14:59.934 --> 00:15:02.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your favorite theocratic songs

00:15:04.106 --> 00:15:06.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
or of videos to use in the ministry.

00:15:06.984 --> 00:15:08.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can also make a playlist

00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:10.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
of pictures to use in a talk,

00:15:10.487 --> 00:15:11.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then share it

00:15:11.906 --> 00:15:13.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the audio/video support brothers

00:15:13.991 --> 00:15:15.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can use <i> JW Library </i>

00:15:15.993 --> 00:15:17.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
to display the pictures.

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:21.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look for an update
to the app in the coming weeks.

00:15:23.626 --> 00:15:26.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
what have we discussed?

00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:32.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever trials or tests
you’re dealing with personally,

00:15:32.135 --> 00:15:34.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
be assured that Jehovah sees you

00:15:34.972 --> 00:15:37.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is aware of what you’re going through.

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:41.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
He too is affected and is moved to help.

00:15:41.729 --> 00:15:45.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
So continue to lean on Jehovah in prayer,

00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
keep up your good spiritual routine,

00:15:48.903 --> 00:15:51.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
stay busy in the ministry,

00:15:51.573 --> 00:15:55.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reach out to others for support.

00:15:55.201 --> 00:16:00.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, continue to make Jehovah your refuge!

00:16:00.165 --> 00:16:05.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please know
that we love you all very much.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:16:07.798 --> 00:16:10.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
