00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:03.649 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome, brothers and sisters!

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:05.109 line:10% position:50% align:center
In our program,

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.111 line:10% position:50% align:center
we have a thrilling update

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:08.737 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the Ramapo project

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reports about our brothers and sisters

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:14.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Norway, Russia, and Ukraine.

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll also hear about the tremendous increase

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Bible studies earth wide.

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally,
we have a very exciting announcement!

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay tuned.

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting this month, January 2023,

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:35.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll resume in-person 
circuit assemblies and theocratic schools.

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:38.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re thrilled to have these opportunities

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gather together again!

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re also looking forward

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our in-person conventions later this year.

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure, like me, you’re looking forward

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
to singing
that opening song at the convention

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:56.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
with thousands of our brothers and sisters.

00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:02.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is the new headquarters project
at Ramapo, New York, progressing?

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re thrilled to inform you

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
that on December 28, 2022,

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Town Board of Ramapo

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
approved the zoning for the facility

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave approval for tree removal.

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:20.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
This key approval

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
will allow
the overall project to move forward.

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope to begin clearing the site

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
as early as January 2023—this month!

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the project at Ramapo gains momentum,

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:40.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
it reminds us of how we felt
about the Warwick project

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:44.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the thousands
of volunteers who supported it.

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon after we moved in from Brooklyn,

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:52.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lett read an open letter
from the Governing Body at morning worship.

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:56.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the Ramapo project now moving forward,

00:01:56.178 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s hear that beautiful letter from 2016.

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think
about this first morning worship

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our beautiful new headquarters,

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body
thought it would be appropriate

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide an open letter

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:17.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
to thank all who have shared

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the hard work that went into this project.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
How we appreciate it!

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
But permit me, please, to read
this open letter from the Governing Body.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dear Brothers:
On behalf of the Warwick Bethel family,

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:40.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Governing Body
would like to express deep appreciation

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for our lovely new home
here at Warwick Bethel.

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:50.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How we love our new residences and offices!

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:53.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fresh air, quiet environment,

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:55.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and beautiful scenery

00:02:55.738 --> 00:03:00.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are already having
a beneficial effect on how we feel.

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are confident that now

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:06.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—with Jehovah’s blessing and help—

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we will be able to work even harder

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and accomplish even more
in behalf of Kingdom interests.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even though we do not deserve
such a wonderful place to live and work,

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we truly appreciate this generous expression

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—1 Peter 4:10.

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:32.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are most grateful to Jehovah

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:36.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the more than 27,000
different brothers and sisters

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who volunteered to work
on the construction of this project.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many of you dear friends took vacation time,

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
“paid your own transportation costs,
lived in small rooms,

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and got up very early
in the morning to ride buses or shuttles

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the work site.

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:59.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then you worked tirelessly
in all kinds of weather,

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:02.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“putting your heart into supporting

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:05.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“this theocratic building project.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:10.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many of you accepted
multiple invitations to work here.

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Unquestionably, Jehovah loves you very much

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for what you have done.

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:19.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please be assured that the Governing Body

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“loves you very much too!

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To borrow Paul’s words to the Thessalonians,

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:31.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you have become so beloved to us.’

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—1 Thessalonians 2:8.

00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:39.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In addition to those who shared
in the actual construction work,

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:42.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“countless other dear brothers and sisters

00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:45.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“supported this project from afar.

00:04:45.722 --> 00:04:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Self-sacrificing wives backed
their husbands’ participation,

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:54.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“diligent remote workers lent a hand,

00:04:54.064 --> 00:04:57.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“generous publishers assisted financially,

00:04:57.693 --> 00:04:59.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and other loyal ones

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:03.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“encouraged and provided practical help

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:08.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who were able
to work at the Warwick site.

00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:11.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reflecting on those who helped from far away

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“reminds us of 1 Samuel 30:24.

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:20.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God’s Word tells us that the ones
who stayed behind with the baggage

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
“received the same share

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:26.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as the ones who went into battle.

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:29.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even though we do not personally know

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:32.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the vast majority
of you brothers and sisters

00:05:32.644 --> 00:05:35.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who have supported this project,

00:05:35.397 --> 00:05:40.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a certainty,
Jehovah knows each and every one of you.

00:05:40.944 --> 00:05:43.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As Hebrews 6:10 assures:

00:05:43.614 --> 00:05:47.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘God is not unrighteous
so as to forget your work

00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:50.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the love you showed for his name

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:53.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by ministering . . . to the holy ones.’

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:58.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah expects us to give him our best.

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:02.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why He found
Cain’s sacrifice displeasing.

00:06:02.382 --> 00:06:05.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He knew that Cain could have done better.

00:06:05.594 --> 00:06:07.888 line:90% position:50% align:center

“Additionally, the Governing Body would
like to thank from the bottom of our heart

thousands of volunteers

Thank you, brothers and sisters,

00:09:02.187 --> 00:09:04.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your heartfelt prayers,

00:09:04.481 --> 00:09:06.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for your generous donations

00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:09.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
in behalf of the Ramapo project.

00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:14.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon a special video report
on the Ramapo approval

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:17.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be released on jw.org.

00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:22.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may recall that in our last update,

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:25.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
we informed you
about what is happening in Norway.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were shocked when we received a letter

00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:32.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
from government authorities in Oslo, Norway,

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
threatening to remove
our registration as a religious community.

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:40.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to update you on this case.

00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:44.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
On December 22, 2022,

00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:46.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
the authorities announced their decision

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:49.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deregister Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a religious community in Norway.

00:09:52.946 --> 00:09:55.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, on December 28,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
we filed an injunction application

00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:01.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Oslo District Court,

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:04.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking them to suspend the deregistration

00:10:04.332 --> 00:10:08.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the matter
had been resolved by the court.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
On December 30,

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:14.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
the court granted a temporary injunction.

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:18.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very grateful
to the Oslo District Court

00:10:18.763 --> 00:10:21.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
for granting this injunction.

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:25.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please continue to pray
for a successful outcome.

00:10:28.106 --> 00:10:32.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, we’ve had some interesting
developments regarding Russia.

00:10:32.986 --> 00:10:36.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
On December 9, 2022,

00:10:36.448 --> 00:10:39.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Council of Europe “strongly urged” Russia

00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:44.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to reverse the ban imposed on the activities

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of all Jehovah’s Witnesses . . .

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:48.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to discontinue

00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:51.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
all criminal proceedings against them.”

00:10:52.255 --> 00:10:55.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time will tell how
the Russian government responds.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please continue to pray

00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:03.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of our imprisoned
brothers and sisters.

00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:08.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have full confidence
in the thoughts expressed by the psalmist

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:10.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 9:9, 10:

00:11:11.483 --> 00:11:16.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will become
a secure refuge for the oppressed,

00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:20.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a secure refuge in times of distress.

00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:24.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those knowing your name will trust in you;

00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:29.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will never abandon
those seeking you, O Jehovah.”

00:11:30.168 --> 00:11:34.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy that some of our brothers
have been released in recent months.

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:39.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, on November 30, 2022,

00:11:39.052 --> 00:11:41.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Sergey Polyakov

00:11:41.179 --> 00:11:45.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
was released
after serving a three-year sentence.

00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:50.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we want to keep in mind
the over 175 brothers and sisters

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
around the world
who are still in prison for their faith.

00:11:55.735 --> 00:11:59.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes Brother Andrey Vlasov,

00:11:59.197 --> 00:12:03.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was sentenced
to seven years in a penal colony in Russia.

00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:07.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video
gives us an update on his case.

00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:13.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Andrey Vlasov is a seriously ill,
disabled man from Siberia

00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:16.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom a Russian court
sentenced to seven years in a prison colony.

00:12:16.881 --> 00:12:19.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
This peaceable, religious man was convicted

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:22.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
merely for believing
in God and reading the Bible.

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:26.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
There wasn’t a single piece
of legitimate evidence presented.

00:12:26.558 --> 00:12:29.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
regarding the charge of subverting

00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:31.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
the constitutional structure of the country,

00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:32.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
how did he do that?

00:12:32.606 --> 00:12:36.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
There wasn’t a single example
of anything my husband had done.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Supposedly, he broke up family bonds.

00:12:39.487 --> 00:12:41.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
What families did he break up?

00:12:41.615 --> 00:12:44.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are their names and places of residence?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing was substantiated.

00:12:46.244 --> 00:12:49.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the bill of charges, only Article 282

00:12:49.456 --> 00:12:52.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding extremism was referred to.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Andrey had given his concluding speech

00:12:55.086 --> 00:12:57.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
on May 23, 2022,

00:12:57.422 --> 00:13:00.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
the court took a break for just five minutes

00:13:00.508 --> 00:13:02.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the judge announced the verdict

00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:04.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a seven-year prison sentence.

00:13:04.929 --> 00:13:06.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we left for the hearing,

00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:09.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
my husband asked me
not to cry whatever happened.

00:13:14.773 --> 00:13:17.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to fulfill his request.

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:33.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
My reaction was one of shock.

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:35.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the same for everyone there

00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:38.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
—friends, acquaintances, and relatives—
they were all in shock.

00:13:38.296 --> 00:13:43.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neither the prosecutor nor the judge
considered Andrey’s health condition.

00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:45.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was arrested in the courtroom

00:13:45.053 --> 00:13:48.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and taken to the detention center
in the city of Novokuznetsk.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he reached the detention center,

00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:53.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was initially in a cell by himself.

00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:56.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were huge cockroaches
running around and cobwebs.

00:13:56.439 --> 00:13:57.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was dirty.

00:13:57.857 --> 00:14:02.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made it as orderly and livable as possible
for himself so that he could stay there.

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:05.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Andrey suffers from a severe form

00:14:05.407 --> 00:14:07.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
of deformational arthrosis

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
of both hip joints with ankylosis,

00:14:10.745 --> 00:14:13.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is a total loss of movement.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:16.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, his ability to move around,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
care for himself, and socialize are impaired.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just to put his trousers on by himself
(elementary things like that),

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has to lie on the floor
and wrestle his way into them.

00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:27.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Russian Federation

00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:29.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
ratified a list of serious illnesses

00:14:29.514 --> 00:14:32.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
that exempt someone from being imprisoned.

00:14:32.142 --> 00:14:34.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Andrey’s illness is clearly included.

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
To unequivocally prove this to the judge,

00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:38.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
I procured confirmation from a specialist.

00:14:38.523 --> 00:14:39.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
The illness can be progressive.

00:14:39.774 --> 00:14:43.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, unfortunately,
in Andrey’s case it is already progressing.

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:47.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the fact that Andrey is disabled
and needs constant medical assistance,

00:14:47.907 --> 00:14:50.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was put in a temporary
holding cell immediately

00:14:50.618 --> 00:14:53.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the authorities
raided his home in 2020.

00:14:53.663 --> 00:14:56.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Subsequently, he was placed
under house arrest.

00:14:56.458 --> 00:15:00.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
His pretrial restrictions
lasted for one year and ten months.

00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:03.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
When under house arrest,

00:15:03.047 --> 00:15:07.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was difficult for my husband
to be confined at home.

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:12.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was only allowed two hours
to walk around the building.

00:15:12.015 --> 00:15:15.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wasn’t allowed to use
the telephone or the Internet

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:18.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to associate with anyone except me,

00:15:18.938 --> 00:15:20.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I lived at the same address.

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:24.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even to visit any doctor or a dentist,

00:15:24.694 --> 00:15:27.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to formally request permission

00:15:27.155 --> 00:15:30.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the investigator
in charge of Andrey’s case.

00:15:30.909 --> 00:15:34.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to Natalia,
Andrey has not lost his optimism.

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:38.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tries to keep in contact
with her and his friends by writing letters.

00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:43.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
They all hope that the Court of Cassation
will release Andrey from confinement.

00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:46.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve reflected on all
that we’ve been through the last two years

00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:49.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and realized
that I was really only frightened

00:15:49.803 --> 00:15:53.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was anticipating what might happen.

00:15:53.973 --> 00:15:55.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever things did happen,

00:15:55.725 --> 00:15:59.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was very close to me
and I felt his support.

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:02.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Behind Jehovah’s wall of protection,

00:16:02.315 --> 00:16:05.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
I now see
that the winds of persecution and trials

00:16:05.485 --> 00:16:07.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
are nothing to be afraid of.

00:16:08.363 --> 00:16:12.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah continues
to take care of Brother Vlasov,

00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:17.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
as can be seen from this experience
that he had in October:

00:16:17.163 --> 00:16:20.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another brother, Aleksandr Putintsev,

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:25.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being transported
in a prison train to a penal colony.

00:16:25.296 --> 00:16:29.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had already traveled
on the train for ten days

00:16:29.175 --> 00:16:34.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it stopped in the Kemerovo Region
to add more prisoners.

00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:38.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brother Andrey
was loaded onto the prison train

00:16:38.393 --> 00:16:42.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and placed in a cell with other prisoners.

00:16:42.188 --> 00:16:47.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
The other prisoners started to ask
who he was and what he was convicted of.

00:16:47.235 --> 00:16:50.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
He answered, “I am Andrey Vlasov,

00:16:50.905 --> 00:16:53.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I am in prison for my faith in God.”

00:16:54.617 --> 00:16:59.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
At hearing this, a man almost
fell off the bench and said to Andrey,

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:02.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You and I must be fellow believers!”

00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:04.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine?

00:17:04.502 --> 00:17:09.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although they were  from such
different regions and different prisons,

00:17:09.173 --> 00:17:12.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were placed on the same train

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:15.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even in the same cell on the train!

00:17:15.305 --> 00:17:18.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it turns out, the wives of these brothers

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
had prayed that their husbands
would be able to meet.

00:17:22.478 --> 00:17:25.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seemed impossible,

00:17:25.106 --> 00:17:28.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah made it happen.

00:17:28.026 --> 00:17:31.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers spent over 12 hours together!

00:17:31.321 --> 00:17:36.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
They enjoyed a much-needed
“interchange of encouragement.”

00:17:36.242 --> 00:17:41.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, the “Hearer of prayer”
knows how to care for our brothers.

00:17:42.248 --> 00:17:45.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t forget
our three sisters in Russia

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are currently in prison for their faith:

00:17:48.504 --> 00:17:51.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Olga Ivanova,

00:17:51.507 --> 00:17:54.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Lyudmila Shchekoldina,

00:17:54.385 --> 00:17:57.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sister Anna Safronova.

00:17:57.764 --> 00:18:00.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Safronova is serving

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:03.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
a six-year sentence in a penal colony.

00:18:03.728 --> 00:18:06.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the harshest, longest sentence

00:18:06.898 --> 00:18:11.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
imposed on a sister since the 2017 ban.

00:18:11.903 --> 00:18:13.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also keep in mind

00:18:13.738 --> 00:18:17.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
71-year-old Brother Shamil Khakimov,

00:18:17.283 --> 00:18:19.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s been imprisoned in Tajikistan

00:18:19.869 --> 00:18:22.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
since February 2019.

00:18:22.997 --> 00:18:25.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding Brother Khakimov,

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:27.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Commissioner
of the United States Commission

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:30.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
on International Religious Freedom,

00:18:30.213 --> 00:18:32.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nury Turkel, stated:

00:18:33.216 --> 00:18:35.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Since 2019,

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“this ailing, elderly man

00:18:38.262 --> 00:18:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been languishing in a decrepit

00:18:41.557 --> 00:18:43.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and overcrowded prison

00:18:43.643 --> 00:18:47.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on a bogus
seven-and-a-half-year prison sentence.

00:18:47.981 --> 00:18:51.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This term could very well
represent a death sentence

00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:54.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a man wrongly imprisoned

00:18:54.696 --> 00:18:56.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for peacefully practicing

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
his religious beliefs
as a Jehovah’s Witness.”

00:19:01.244 --> 00:19:05.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although his sentence was reduced in 2020,

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:09.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Khakimov is not scheduled for release

00:19:09.877 --> 00:19:12.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
until May 2023.

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please keep praying for Brother Khakimov.

00:19:18.219 --> 00:19:19.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the world,

00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:24.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters
are also busy with disaster relief.

00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:27.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, some months ago,

00:19:27.103 --> 00:19:31.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was anticipated
that many brothers and sisters in Ukraine

00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:34.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
would need warm clothing for the winter.

00:19:34.402 --> 00:19:38.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
So over 200 congregations in Germany

00:19:38.698 --> 00:19:42.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
were invited to donate
clothing and other basic items.

00:19:42.535 --> 00:19:43.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result?

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Approximately 36,000 pieces of clothing

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 6,500 pairs of shoes

00:19:52.086 --> 00:19:53.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
were generously donated.

00:19:54.547 --> 00:19:56.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
With assistance from the Poland branch,

00:19:56.507 --> 00:19:59.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
105 pallets

00:19:59.218 --> 00:20:03.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 23.7 metric tons (26.1 tons)

00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:07.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
of donated clothing
were shipped by truck to Ukraine.

00:20:08.853 --> 00:20:10.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
One grateful brother said:

00:20:10.897 --> 00:20:14.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The items we received as humanitarian aid

00:20:14.484 --> 00:20:18.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“help us to endure
the cold and wet weather. . . .

00:20:18.196 --> 00:20:21.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was warm when I had to flee from my home

00:20:21.032 --> 00:20:24.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I could not take along
any warm clothes . . .

00:20:24.368 --> 00:20:28.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you from the bottom of my heart
for your care.

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:30.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is vivid evidence

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the love of Jehovah, our Father.”

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister said: “We are so touched
by your generosity and kindness. . . . 

00:20:39.425 --> 00:20:43.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have helped us
overcome excessive worries.

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:46.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Through you, Jehovah reminded us

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:50.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that he will never leave us or forsake us,

00:20:50.061 --> 00:20:54.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is no need
to be afraid and worried.”

00:20:54.107 --> 00:20:57.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
What beautiful expressions!

00:20:57.944 --> 00:21:00.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following recent natural disasters,

00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:05.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
the reconstruction work
is progressing well in Cuba,

00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:09.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nigeria, the Philippines, Puerto Rico,

00:21:09.247 --> 00:21:12.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
the United States, and elsewhere.

00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:16.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
We keep all those affected by disasters

00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:19.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those providing relief in our prayers.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:24.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank all of you
for your generous contributions,

00:21:24.178 --> 00:21:27.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
which help us care
for our brothers and sisters

00:21:27.557 --> 00:21:29.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
facing these disasters.

00:21:29.725 --> 00:21:30.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:21:32.311 --> 00:21:35.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since June 2022,

00:21:35.022 --> 00:21:38.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we returned to in-person forms
of the ministry,

00:21:38.734 --> 00:21:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have been hearing exciting reports
from the field.

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:45.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve seen a tremendous increase

00:21:45.658 --> 00:21:48.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the number of Bible studies.

00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:50.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, worldwide,

00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:52.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve seen an increase

00:21:52.623 --> 00:21:56.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
of nearly 30 percent since May!

00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:58.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that now

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than one and a half million
new Bible studies are being conducted.

00:22:03.926 --> 00:22:06.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:22:06.554 --> 00:22:10.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice a few comments
from branch offices around the world

00:22:10.892 --> 00:22:15.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the growth
we’ve observed since May 2022.

00:22:17.106 --> 00:22:20.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Angola, from May to October 2022,

00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:25.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had an increase
of over 265,000 Bible studies.

00:22:25.948 --> 00:22:28.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the lands
under the Central America branch,

00:22:28.284 --> 00:22:33.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re now reporting
over 680,000 Bible studies.

00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:36.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s over 20 percent more studies

00:22:36.292 --> 00:22:39.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
than were reported in May of 2022.

00:22:39.754 --> 00:22:41.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Papua New Guinea,

00:22:41.547 --> 00:22:44.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve had a 15 percent
increase in Bible studies

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:47.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
since our return to in-person preaching.

00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:50.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the lands under the Central Europe branch,

00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:54.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are happy to report
an increase in Bible studies.

00:22:54.769 --> 00:22:57.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 6,800

00:22:57.813 --> 00:23:00.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
new Bible studies have been reported

00:23:00.316 --> 00:23:05.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
just in the first three months
of the 2023 service year.

00:23:05.154 --> 00:23:07.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Congo (Kinshasa), we have reported

00:23:07.823 --> 00:23:12.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 290,000 additional Bible studies

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:16.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
since the resumption of public witnessing
and the house-to-house ministry.

00:23:17.792 --> 00:23:20.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the lands under the United States branch,

00:23:20.002 --> 00:23:23.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had nearly 30,000 more Bible studies

00:23:23.673 --> 00:23:27.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
in just the first two months
of the 2023 service year.

00:23:27.468 --> 00:23:30.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Spain, we had a 4 percent increase

00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:34.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the number of Bible studies
from May to October 2022.

00:23:34.684 --> 00:23:39.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Mozambique,
we are reporting 47,000 more Bible studies

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
since we have returned
to our in-person ministry.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Venezuela, we reported

00:23:45.152 --> 00:23:48.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 67,000 Bible studies back in May.

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:52.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in October, we reported nearly 105,000.

00:23:52.952 --> 00:23:55.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s exciting
to see Jehovah blessing the work.

00:23:57.039 --> 00:24:01.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Korea, we’ve had 30 consecutive peaks

00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:03.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the number of publishers.

00:24:03.713 --> 00:24:08.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now have 106,050.

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:13.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we had our 27th consecutive peak

00:24:13.472 --> 00:24:15.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the number of regular pioneers.

00:24:15.599 --> 00:24:19.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now have 50,846.

00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:23.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means almost half of the publishers

00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
are serving as regular pioneers.

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:28.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in Malawi,

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve had a tremendous increase
in the number of Bible studies.

00:24:31.574 --> 00:24:36.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
In May, we had more than 87,000 studies.

00:24:36.078 --> 00:24:37.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in October,

00:24:37.705 --> 00:24:42.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had more than 130,000 Bible studies.

00:24:42.543 --> 00:24:45.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Philippines, since May

00:24:45.129 --> 00:24:49.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of Bible studies
has increased by more than 60,000.

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:52.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in November, for the first time,

00:24:52.428 --> 00:24:56.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have crossed the 240,000 publisher mark.

00:24:58.392 --> 00:25:00.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that encouraging?

00:25:00.603 --> 00:25:02.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s one more example:

00:25:02.897 --> 00:25:05.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a country where the work is under ban,

00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:07.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was an increase

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
of nearly 3,000 Bible studies since May.

00:25:12.198 --> 00:25:16.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s wonderful that, despite opposition,

00:25:16.077 --> 00:25:19.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work is moving ahead!

00:25:19.038 --> 00:25:23.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body is thrilled
when we hear these reports

00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:26.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what’s taking place in the field.

00:25:26.253 --> 00:25:31.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, Jehovah is speeding up the work.

00:25:33.052 --> 00:25:35.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, it was announced

00:25:35.513 --> 00:25:40.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
that regular pioneers will once again
have an hour requirement,

00:25:40.434 --> 00:25:44.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
effective March 1, 2023.

00:25:44.355 --> 00:25:47.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pioneers are now busy
looking at their schedules

00:25:47.775 --> 00:25:51.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and planning how they’ll be able
to meet the hour requirement.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body, though,
is realistic about the world situation.

00:25:57.743 --> 00:25:59.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many branches have reported

00:25:59.954 --> 00:26:03.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
that pioneers are struggling
to meet their hour goal

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the rising cost of living.

00:26:06.377 --> 00:26:10.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many are contending
with natural disasters,

00:26:10.256 --> 00:26:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
unrest, and war.

00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:15.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1999,

00:26:15.594 --> 00:26:20.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body considered
the situation of the pioneers.

00:26:20.433 --> 00:26:24.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
The January 1999 <i>Kingdom Ministry</i>  said:

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[We have] observed

00:26:26.397 --> 00:26:30.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the mounting difficulties faced by pioneers,

00:26:30.025 --> 00:26:32.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“especially with regard to finding

00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:35.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
“part-time secular work that will allow them

00:26:35.698 --> 00:26:38.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to care adequately for their personal needs

00:26:38.659 --> 00:26:42.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so as to remain in the full-time service.

00:26:42.288 --> 00:26:46.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The present economic situation in many lands

00:26:46.208 --> 00:26:49.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has also made it increasingly difficult

00:26:49.962 --> 00:26:53.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for others to enter the pioneer work,

00:26:53.132 --> 00:26:57.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even though that is their heartfelt desire.

00:26:57.219 --> 00:26:59.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During recent months,

00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:01.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“these and other factors

00:27:01.223 --> 00:27:03.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been carefully considered.”

00:27:05.144 --> 00:27:07.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of those factors,

00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:10.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body decided back in 1999

00:27:10.608 --> 00:27:15.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
to adjust
the hour requirements for the pioneers.

00:27:15.446 --> 00:27:18.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, 24 years later,

00:27:18.365 --> 00:27:22.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
as world conditions continue to deteriorate,

00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:25.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body sees that our pioneers

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:29.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
are facing similar challenges.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we are very pleased to announce

00:27:34.298 --> 00:27:37.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Governing Body has decided

00:27:37.092 --> 00:27:41.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
to adjust the hour requirements for pioneers,

00:27:41.138 --> 00:27:45.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
effective March 1, 2023.

00:27:45.893 --> 00:27:49.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may want to get a pen
or something to write this down on.

00:27:49.522 --> 00:27:51.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:54.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are the new requirements:

00:27:54.902 --> 00:27:57.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
For regular pioneers,

00:27:57.196 --> 00:28:02.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
the requirement
will now be 600 hours per year,

00:28:02.243 --> 00:28:06.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, an average of 50 hours per month.

00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:09.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
For auxiliary pioneers,

00:28:09.917 --> 00:28:13.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
the requirement will now be 30 hours.

00:28:13.212 --> 00:28:17.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice this—this is very exciting:

00:28:17.258 --> 00:28:19.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
During March and April

00:28:19.385 --> 00:28:22.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and during the month
of the circuit overseer’s visit,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
publishers can choose to auxiliary pioneer

00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:30.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a reduced hour requirement of 15 hours.

00:28:30.896 --> 00:28:34.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
This should make it possible
for many more of us

00:28:34.775 --> 00:28:37.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share as auxiliary pioneers

00:28:37.361 --> 00:28:41.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
during those months of special activity.

00:28:41.365 --> 00:28:45.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about special pioneers and missionaries?

00:28:45.202 --> 00:28:47.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will now have an hour requirement

00:28:47.913 --> 00:28:51.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 100 hours per month.

00:28:51.458 --> 00:28:55.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sisters who are serving
as special pioneers or missionaries

00:28:55.588 --> 00:28:58.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who are 40 years of age or older

00:28:58.882 --> 00:29:03.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
have a reduced hour requirement of 90 hours.

00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:08.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should we view these adjustments?

00:29:08.267 --> 00:29:11.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is powerful evidence

00:29:11.395 --> 00:29:15.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the great love and tender concern

00:29:15.566 --> 00:29:18.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah feels for his people.

00:29:18.694 --> 00:29:21.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want as many as possible

00:29:21.405 --> 00:29:26.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
to retain their precious privilege
of serving as pioneers.

00:29:26.243 --> 00:29:30.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we feel that these adjustments
will make it possible

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
for many more to consider
taking up the pioneer work.

00:29:35.628 --> 00:29:39.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the number of people
requesting Bible studies

00:29:39.006 --> 00:29:41.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
is increasing worldwide,

00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:44.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
there could never be a better time

00:29:44.094 --> 00:29:47.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expand our share in the ministry.

00:29:48.974 --> 00:29:52.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are serving as a pioneer right now,

00:29:52.561 --> 00:29:55.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
we hope that you’ll continue.

00:29:55.481 --> 00:29:58.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re not yet serving
as a regular pioneer,

00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:02.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
would it be possible for you to do so?

00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:05.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the Memorial season just ahead,

00:30:05.783 --> 00:30:09.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt all elders, ministerial servants,

00:30:09.662 --> 00:30:13.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
and publishers will prayerfully consider

00:30:13.248 --> 00:30:16.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they can auxiliary pioneer.

00:30:16.085 --> 00:30:18.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you do so?

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:22.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look to Jehovah
to bless all of these arrangements

00:30:22.675 --> 00:30:25.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his glory and praise!

00:30:25.844 --> 00:30:30.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, may we all continue to do our very best

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:35.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life”!

00:30:36.063 --> 00:30:39.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you all very much!

00:30:39.566 --> 00:30:42.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
