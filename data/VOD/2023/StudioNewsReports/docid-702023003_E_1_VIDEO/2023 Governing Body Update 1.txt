00:00:01 Welcome, brothers and sisters!
00:00:03 In our program,
00:00:05 we have a thrilling update
00:00:07 about the Ramapo project
00:00:08 and reports about our brothers and sisters
00:00:11 in Norway, Russia, and Ukraine.
00:00:14 We’ll also hear about the tremendous increase
00:00:17 in Bible studies earth wide.
00:00:20 And finally, we have a very exciting announcement!
00:00:24 Stay tuned.
00:00:26 Starting this month, January 2023,
00:00:30 we’ll resume in-person  circuit assemblies and theocratic schools.
00:00:35 We’re thrilled to have these opportunities
00:00:38 to gather together again!
00:00:41 And we’re also looking forward
00:00:43 to our in-person conventions later this year.
00:00:46 I’m sure, like me, you’re looking forward
00:00:50 to singing that opening song at the convention
00:00:53 with thousands of our brothers and sisters.
00:00:57 How is the new headquarters project at Ramapo, New York, progressing?
00:01:02 We’re thrilled to inform you
00:01:05 that on December 28, 2022,
00:01:09 the Town Board of Ramapo
00:01:11 approved the zoning for the facility
00:01:14 and gave approval for tree removal.
00:01:18 This key approval
00:01:20 will allow the overall project to move forward.
00:01:24 We hope to begin clearing the site
00:01:27 as early as January 2023—this month!
00:01:32 As the project at Ramapo gains momentum,
00:01:35 it reminds us of how we felt about the Warwick project
00:01:40 and the thousands of volunteers who supported it.
00:01:44 Soon after we moved in from Brooklyn,
00:01:47 Brother Lett read an open letter from the Governing Body at morning worship.
00:01:52 With the Ramapo project now moving forward,
00:01:56 let’s hear that beautiful letter from 2016.
00:02:02 When we think about this first morning worship
00:02:05 from our beautiful new headquarters,
00:02:08 the Governing Body thought it would be appropriate
00:02:12 to provide an open letter
00:02:14 to thank all who have shared
00:02:17 in the hard work that went into this project.
00:02:20 How we appreciate it!
00:02:22 But permit me, please, to read this open letter from the Governing Body.
00:02:30 “Dear Brothers: On behalf of the Warwick Bethel family,
00:02:35 “the Governing Body would like to express deep appreciation
00:02:40 “for our lovely new home here at Warwick Bethel.
00:02:44 “How we love our new residences and offices!
00:02:50 “The fresh air, quiet environment,
00:02:53 “and beautiful scenery
00:02:55 “are already having a beneficial effect on how we feel.
00:03:00 “We are confident that now
00:03:03 “—with Jehovah’s blessing and help—
00:03:06 “we will be able to work even harder
00:03:08 “and accomplish even more in behalf of Kingdom interests.
00:03:13 “Even though we do not deserve such a wonderful place to live and work,
00:03:18 “we truly appreciate this generous expression
00:03:22 “of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.
00:03:26 “—1 Peter 4:10.
00:03:29 “We are most grateful to Jehovah
00:03:32 “for the more than 27,000 different brothers and sisters
00:03:36 “who volunteered to work on the construction of this project.
00:03:40 “Many of you dear friends took vacation time,
00:03:44 “paid your own transportation costs, lived in small rooms,
00:03:48 “and got up very early in the morning to ride buses or shuttles
00:03:52 “to the work site.
00:03:54 “Then you worked tirelessly in all kinds of weather,
00:03:59 “putting your heart into supporting
00:04:02 “this theocratic building project.
00:04:05 “Many of you accepted multiple invitations to work here.
00:04:10 “Unquestionably, Jehovah loves you very much
00:04:14 “for what you have done.
00:04:16 “Please be assured that the Governing Body
00:04:19 “loves you very much too!
00:04:22 “To borrow Paul’s words to the Thessalonians,
00:04:26 “‘you have become so beloved to us.’
00:04:31 “—1 Thessalonians 2:8.
00:04:34 “In addition to those who shared in the actual construction work,
00:04:39 “countless other dear brothers and sisters
00:04:42 “supported this project from afar.
00:04:45 “Self-sacrificing wives backed their husbands’ participation,
00:04:50 “diligent remote workers lent a hand,
00:04:54 “generous publishers assisted financially,
00:04:57 “and other loyal ones
00:04:59 “encouraged and provided practical help
00:05:03 “to those who were able to work at the Warwick site.
00:05:08 “Reflecting on those who helped from far away
00:05:11 “reminds us of 1 Samuel 30:24.
00:05:15 “God’s Word tells us that the ones who stayed behind with the baggage
00:05:20 “received the same share
00:05:22 “as the ones who went into battle.
00:05:27 “Even though we do not personally know
00:05:29 “the vast majority of you brothers and sisters
00:05:32 “who have supported this project,
00:05:35 “for a certainty, Jehovah knows each and every one of you.
00:05:40 “As Hebrews 6:10 assures:
00:05:43 “‘God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work
00:05:47 “‘and the love you showed for his name
00:05:50 “by ministering . . . to the holy ones.’
00:05:54 “Jehovah expects us to give him our best.
00:05:58 “That is why He found Cain’s sacrifice displeasing.
00:06:02 “He knew that Cain could have done better.
00:06:05 “—Genesis 4:5.
00:06:07 “But like Abel,
00:06:10 “you dear friends have given Jehovah your best.
00:06:14 “We are confident that you will continue
00:06:17 “to show your wholehearted love for Jehovah
00:06:19 “in harmony with your circumstances.
00:06:23 “—Genesis 4:4; Matthew 22:37.
00:06:28 “Additionally, the Governing Body would like to thank from the bottom of our heart
00:06:33 “the five brothers
00:06:35 “who served on the Warwick Construction Project Committee
00:06:39 “for their inexhaustible labors of love.
00:06:44 “We also want to thank profusely
00:06:47 “the many Bethelites who worked ‘shoulder to shoulder’
00:06:51 “with us in connection with this massive theocratic endeavor.
00:06:55 “—Zephaniah 3:9.
00:06:58 “Included are the brothers on the United States Branch Committee
00:07:02 “and the hardworking brothers and sisters
00:07:05 “in the Furniture Moving Department,
00:07:08 “the Maintenance Department, the Computer Department,
00:07:11 “the Broadcasting Department, the Transportation Department,
00:07:15 “and the Bethel Office
00:07:17 “who are still carrying out the gigantic task
00:07:21 “of moving the Bethel family from Brooklyn to Warwick.
00:07:28 “We would certainly be remiss
00:07:30 “if we failed to thank also
00:07:33 “the thousands upon thousands of devoted brothers and sisters
00:07:37 “who labored on the project at Wallkill.
00:07:42 “That too was a massive undertaking!
00:07:46 “May Jehovah bless the willing spirit
00:07:48 “that you dear ones have shown.
00:07:52 “In the Bible,
00:07:54 “sometimes a thought is repeated three times for emphasis.
00:07:58 “In this vein, we say,
00:08:01 “‘thank you, thank you, thank you’
00:08:06 “to all who have helped us and are continuing to help us
00:08:11 “bring this wonderful theocratic project
00:08:14 “at headquarters to completion!
00:08:17 “‘May Jehovah reward you for what you have done,
00:08:22 “‘and may there be a perfect wage
00:08:24 “‘for you from Jehovah the God of Israel,
00:08:28 “under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.’
00:08:32 “—Ruth 2:12.
00:08:34 “We express our warm love
00:08:38 “and affection for all of you!
00:08:42 “Your brothers, Governing Body
00:08:45 of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
00:08:48 As was the case for the Warwick project,
00:08:51 thousands of volunteers from the United States
00:08:54 will be needed for Ramapo.
00:08:57 Thank you, brothers and sisters, for offering yourselves willingly,
00:09:02 for your heartfelt prayers,
00:09:04 and for your generous donations
00:09:06 in behalf of the Ramapo project.
00:09:09 Soon a special video report on the Ramapo approval
00:09:14 will be released on jw.org.
00:09:19 You may recall that in our last update,
00:09:22 we informed you about what is happening in Norway.
00:09:26 We were shocked when we received a letter
00:09:29 from government authorities in Oslo, Norway,
00:09:32 threatening to remove our registration as a religious community.
00:09:36 We’re happy to update you on this case.
00:09:40 On December 22, 2022,
00:09:44 the authorities announced their decision
00:09:46 to deregister Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:09:49 as a religious community in Norway.
00:09:52 Then, on December 28,
00:09:55 we filed an injunction application
00:09:58 with the Oslo District Court,
00:10:01 asking them to suspend the deregistration
00:10:04 until the matter had been resolved by the court.
00:10:08 On December 30,
00:10:10 the court granted a temporary injunction.
00:10:14 We’re very grateful to the Oslo District Court
00:10:18 for granting this injunction.
00:10:21 Please continue to pray for a successful outcome.
00:10:28 Recently, we’ve had some interesting developments regarding Russia.
00:10:32 On December 9, 2022,
00:10:36 the Council of Europe “strongly urged” Russia
00:10:39 “to reverse the ban imposed on the activities
00:10:44 “of all Jehovah’s Witnesses . . .
00:10:46 “and to discontinue
00:10:48 all criminal proceedings against them.”
00:10:52 Time will tell how the Russian government responds.
00:10:56 Please continue to pray
00:10:59 for all of our imprisoned brothers and sisters.
00:11:03 We have full confidence in the thoughts expressed by the psalmist
00:11:08 at Psalm 9:9, 10:
00:11:11 “Jehovah will become a secure refuge for the oppressed,
00:11:16 “a secure refuge in times of distress.
00:11:20 “Those knowing your name will trust in you;
00:11:24 you will never abandon those seeking you, O Jehovah.”
00:11:30 We’re happy that some of our brothers have been released in recent months.
00:11:34 For example, on November 30, 2022,
00:11:39 Brother Sergey Polyakov
00:11:41 was released after serving a three-year sentence.
00:11:45 But we want to keep in mind the over 175 brothers and sisters
00:11:50 around the world who are still in prison for their faith.
00:11:55 This includes Brother Andrey Vlasov,
00:11:59 who was sentenced to seven years in a penal colony in Russia.
00:12:03 The following video gives us an update on his case.
00:12:09 Andrey Vlasov is a seriously ill, disabled man from Siberia
00:12:13 whom a Russian court sentenced to seven years in a prison colony.
00:12:16 This peaceable, religious man was convicted
00:12:19 merely for believing in God and reading the Bible.
00:12:22 There wasn’t a single piece of legitimate evidence presented.
00:12:26 For example, regarding the charge of subverting
00:12:29 the constitutional structure of the country,
00:12:31 how did he do that?
00:12:32 There wasn’t a single example of anything my husband had done.
00:12:36 Supposedly, he broke up family bonds.
00:12:39 What families did he break up?
00:12:41 What are their names and places of residence?
00:12:44 Nothing was substantiated.
00:12:46 In the bill of charges, only Article 282
00:12:49 regarding extremism was referred to.
00:12:52 After Andrey had given his concluding speech
00:12:55 on May 23, 2022,
00:12:57 the court took a break for just five minutes
00:13:00 and then the judge announced the verdict
00:13:02 —a seven-year prison sentence.
00:13:04 Before we left for the hearing,
00:13:06 my husband asked me not to cry whatever happened.
00:13:14 I tried to fulfill his request.
00:13:31 My reaction was one of shock.
00:13:33 It was the same for everyone there
00:13:35 —friends, acquaintances, and relatives— they were all in shock.
00:13:38 Neither the prosecutor nor the judge considered Andrey’s health condition.
00:13:43 He was arrested in the courtroom
00:13:45 and taken to the detention center in the city of Novokuznetsk.
00:13:48 When he reached the detention center,
00:13:51 he was initially in a cell by himself.
00:13:53 There were huge cockroaches running around and cobwebs.
00:13:56 It was dirty.
00:13:57 He made it as orderly and livable as possible for himself so that he could stay there.
00:14:02 Andrey suffers from a severe form
00:14:05 of deformational arthrosis
00:14:07 of both hip joints with ankylosis,
00:14:10 which is a total loss of movement.
00:14:13 As a result, his ability to move around,
00:14:16 care for himself, and socialize are impaired.
00:14:20 Just to put his trousers on by himself (elementary things like that),
00:14:23 he has to lie on the floor and wrestle his way into them.
00:14:26 The Russian Federation
00:14:27 ratified a list of serious illnesses
00:14:29 that exempt someone from being imprisoned.
00:14:32 Andrey’s illness is clearly included.
00:14:34 To unequivocally prove this to the judge,
00:14:36 I procured confirmation from a specialist.
00:14:38 The illness can be progressive.
00:14:39 And, unfortunately, in Andrey’s case it is already progressing.
00:14:43 Despite the fact that Andrey is disabled and needs constant medical assistance,
00:14:47 he was put in a temporary holding cell immediately
00:14:50 after the authorities raided his home in 2020.
00:14:53 Subsequently, he was placed under house arrest.
00:14:56 His pretrial restrictions lasted for one year and ten months.
00:15:01 When under house arrest,
00:15:03 it was difficult for my husband to be confined at home.
00:15:07 He was only allowed two hours to walk around the building.
00:15:12 He wasn’t allowed to use the telephone or the Internet
00:15:15 or to associate with anyone except me,
00:15:18 as I lived at the same address.
00:15:21 Even to visit any doctor or a dentist,
00:15:24 we had to formally request permission
00:15:27 from the investigator in charge of Andrey’s case.
00:15:30 According to Natalia, Andrey has not lost his optimism.
00:15:34 He tries to keep in contact with her and his friends by writing letters.
00:15:38 They all hope that the Court of Cassation will release Andrey from confinement.
00:15:43 I’ve reflected on all that we’ve been through the last two years
00:15:46 and realized that I was really only frightened
00:15:49 when I was anticipating what might happen.
00:15:53 Whenever things did happen,
00:15:55 Jehovah was very close to me and I felt his support.
00:15:59 Behind Jehovah’s wall of protection,
00:16:02 I now see that the winds of persecution and trials
00:16:05 are nothing to be afraid of.
00:16:08 Jehovah continues to take care of Brother Vlasov,
00:16:12 as can be seen from this experience that he had in October:
00:16:17 Another brother, Aleksandr Putintsev,
00:16:20 was being transported in a prison train to a penal colony.
00:16:25 He had already traveled on the train for ten days
00:16:29 when it stopped in the Kemerovo Region to add more prisoners.
00:16:34 Our brother Andrey was loaded onto the prison train
00:16:38 and placed in a cell with other prisoners.
00:16:42 The other prisoners started to ask who he was and what he was convicted of.
00:16:47 He answered, “I am Andrey Vlasov,
00:16:50 and I am in prison for my faith in God.”
00:16:54 At hearing this, a man almost fell off the bench and said to Andrey,
00:16:59 “You and I must be fellow believers!”
00:17:02 Can you imagine?
00:17:04 Although they were  from such different regions and different prisons,
00:17:09 they were placed on the same train
00:17:12 and even in the same cell on the train!
00:17:15 As it turns out, the wives of these brothers
00:17:18 had prayed that their husbands would be able to meet.
00:17:22 It seemed impossible,
00:17:25 but Jehovah made it happen.
00:17:28 The brothers spent over 12 hours together!
00:17:31 They enjoyed a much-needed “interchange of encouragement.”
00:17:36 Truly, the “Hearer of prayer” knows how to care for our brothers.
00:17:42 And we don’t forget our three sisters in Russia
00:17:45 who are currently in prison for their faith:
00:17:48 Sister Olga Ivanova,
00:17:51 Sister Lyudmila Shchekoldina,
00:17:54 and Sister Anna Safronova.
00:17:57 Sister Safronova is serving
00:18:00 a six-year sentence in a penal colony.
00:18:03 That is the harshest, longest sentence
00:18:06 imposed on a sister since the 2017 ban.
00:18:11 We also keep in mind
00:18:13 71-year-old Brother Shamil Khakimov,
00:18:17 who’s been imprisoned in Tajikistan
00:18:19 since February 2019.
00:18:22 Regarding Brother Khakimov,
00:18:25 the Commissioner of the United States Commission
00:18:27 on International Religious Freedom,
00:18:30 Nury Turkel, stated:
00:18:33 “Since 2019,
00:18:35 “this ailing, elderly man
00:18:38 “has been languishing in a decrepit
00:18:41 “and overcrowded prison
00:18:43 “on a bogus seven-and-a-half-year prison sentence.
00:18:47 “This term could very well represent a death sentence
00:18:51 “for a man wrongly imprisoned
00:18:54 “for peacefully practicing
00:18:56 his religious beliefs as a Jehovah’s Witness.”
00:19:01 Although his sentence was reduced in 2020,
00:19:05 Brother Khakimov is not scheduled for release
00:19:09 until May 2023.
00:19:12 Please keep praying for Brother Khakimov.
00:19:18 Around the world,
00:19:19 our brothers and sisters are also busy with disaster relief.
00:19:24 For example, some months ago,
00:19:27 it was anticipated that many brothers and sisters in Ukraine
00:19:31 would need warm clothing for the winter.
00:19:34 So over 200 congregations in Germany
00:19:38 were invited to donate clothing and other basic items.
00:19:42 What was the result?
00:19:43 Approximately 36,000 pieces of clothing
00:19:48 and 6,500 pairs of shoes
00:19:52 were generously donated.
00:19:54 With assistance from the Poland branch,
00:19:56 105 pallets
00:19:59 with 23.7 metric tons (26.1 tons)
00:20:03 of donated clothing were shipped by truck to Ukraine.
00:20:08 One grateful brother said:
00:20:10 “The items we received as humanitarian aid
00:20:14 “help us to endure the cold and wet weather. . . .
00:20:18 “It was warm when I had to flee from my home
00:20:21 “and I could not take along any warm clothes . . .
00:20:24 “Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your care.
00:20:28 “This is vivid evidence
00:20:30 of the love of Jehovah, our Father.”
00:20:34 A sister said: “We are so touched by your generosity and kindness. . . .
00:20:39 “You have helped us overcome excessive worries.
00:20:43 “Through you, Jehovah reminded us
00:20:46 “that he will never leave us or forsake us,
00:20:50 that there is no need to be afraid and worried.”
00:20:54 What beautiful expressions!
00:20:57 Following recent natural disasters,
00:21:00 the reconstruction work is progressing well in Cuba,
00:21:05 Nigeria, the Philippines, Puerto Rico,
00:21:09 the United States, and elsewhere.
00:21:12 We keep all those affected by disasters
00:21:16 and those providing relief in our prayers.
00:21:19 And we thank all of you for your generous contributions,
00:21:24 which help us care for our brothers and sisters
00:21:27 facing these disasters.
00:21:29 Thank you!
00:21:32 Since June 2022,
00:21:35 when we returned to in-person forms of the ministry,
00:21:38 we have been hearing exciting reports from the field.
00:21:42 We’ve seen a tremendous increase
00:21:45 in the number of Bible studies.
00:21:48 In fact, worldwide,
00:21:50 we’ve seen an increase
00:21:52 of nearly 30 percent since May!
00:21:56 That means that now
00:21:58 more than one and a half million new Bible studies are being conducted.
00:22:03 Isn’t that wonderful?
00:22:06 Notice a few comments from branch offices around the world
00:22:10 about the growth we’ve observed since May 2022.
00:22:17 In Angola, from May to October 2022,
00:22:20 we had an increase of over 265,000 Bible studies.
00:22:25 In the lands under the Central America branch,
00:22:28 we’re now reporting over 680,000 Bible studies.
00:22:33 That’s over 20 percent more studies
00:22:36 than were reported in May of 2022.
00:22:39 In Papua New Guinea,
00:22:41 we’ve had a 15 percent increase in Bible studies
00:22:44 since our return to in-person preaching.
00:22:48 In the lands under the Central Europe branch,
00:22:50 we are happy to report an increase in Bible studies.
00:22:54 More than 6,800
00:22:57 new Bible studies have been reported
00:23:00 just in the first three months of the 2023 service year.
00:23:05 In Congo (Kinshasa), we have reported
00:23:07 over 290,000 additional Bible studies
00:23:12 since the resumption of public witnessing and the house-to-house ministry.
00:23:17 In the lands under the United States branch,
00:23:20 we had nearly 30,000 more Bible studies
00:23:23 in just the first two months of the 2023 service year.
00:23:27 In Spain, we had a 4 percent increase
00:23:30 in the number of Bible studies from May to October 2022.
00:23:34 In Mozambique, we are reporting 47,000 more Bible studies
00:23:39 since we have returned to our in-person ministry.
00:23:42 In Venezuela, we reported
00:23:45 over 67,000 Bible studies back in May.
00:23:48 But in October, we reported nearly 105,000.
00:23:52 It’s exciting to see Jehovah blessing the work.
00:23:57 In Korea, we’ve had 30 consecutive peaks
00:24:01 in the number of publishers.
00:24:03 We now have 106,050.
00:24:08 And we had our 27th consecutive peak
00:24:13 in the number of regular pioneers.
00:24:15 We now have 50,846.
00:24:19 That means almost half of the publishers
00:24:23 are serving as regular pioneers.
00:24:26 Here in Malawi,
00:24:28 we’ve had a tremendous increase in the number of Bible studies.
00:24:31 In May, we had more than 87,000 studies.
00:24:36 But in October,
00:24:37 we had more than 130,000 Bible studies.
00:24:42 In the Philippines, since May
00:24:45 the number of Bible studies has increased by more than 60,000.
00:24:49 And in November, for the first time,
00:24:52 we have crossed the 240,000 publisher mark.
00:24:58 Wasn’t that encouraging?
00:25:00 Well, here’s one more example:
00:25:02 In a country where the work is under ban,
00:25:05 there was an increase
00:25:07 of nearly 3,000 Bible studies since May.
00:25:12 It’s wonderful that, despite opposition,
00:25:16 the work is moving ahead!
00:25:19 The Governing Body is thrilled when we hear these reports
00:25:23 about what’s taking place in the field.
00:25:26 Truly, Jehovah is speeding up the work.
00:25:33 Recently, it was announced
00:25:35 that regular pioneers will once again have an hour requirement,
00:25:40 effective March 1, 2023.
00:25:44 Pioneers are now busy looking at their schedules
00:25:47 and planning how they’ll be able to meet the hour requirement.
00:25:52 The Governing Body, though, is realistic about the world situation.
00:25:57 Many branches have reported
00:25:59 that pioneers are struggling to meet their hour goal
00:26:03 because of the rising cost of living.
00:26:06 And many are contending with natural disasters,
00:26:10 unrest, and war.
00:26:13 In 1999,
00:26:15 the Governing Body considered the situation of the pioneers.
00:26:20 The January 1999 Kingdom Ministry  said:
00:26:24 “[We have] observed
00:26:26 “the mounting difficulties faced by pioneers,
00:26:30 “especially with regard to finding
00:26:32 “part-time secular work that will allow them
00:26:35 “to care adequately for their personal needs
00:26:38 “so as to remain in the full-time service.
00:26:42 “The present economic situation in many lands
00:26:46 “has also made it increasingly difficult
00:26:49 “for others to enter the pioneer work,
00:26:53 “even though that is their heartfelt desire.
00:26:57 “During recent months,
00:26:59 “these and other factors
00:27:01 have been carefully considered.”
00:27:05 Because of those factors,
00:27:07 the Governing Body decided back in 1999
00:27:10 to adjust the hour requirements for the pioneers.
00:27:15 Now, 24 years later,
00:27:18 as world conditions continue to deteriorate,
00:27:22 the Governing Body sees that our pioneers
00:27:25 are facing similar challenges.
00:27:29 Therefore, we are very pleased to announce
00:27:34 that the Governing Body has decided
00:27:37 to adjust the hour requirements for pioneers,
00:27:41 effective March 1, 2023.
00:27:45 You may want to get a pen or something to write this down on.
00:27:49 Are you ready?
00:27:51 Here are the new requirements:
00:27:54 For regular pioneers,
00:27:57 the requirement will now be 600 hours per year,
00:28:02 that is, an average of 50 hours per month.
00:28:07 For auxiliary pioneers,
00:28:09 the requirement will now be 30 hours.
00:28:13 But notice this—this is very exciting:
00:28:17 During March and April
00:28:19 and during the month of the circuit overseer’s visit,
00:28:22 publishers can choose to auxiliary pioneer
00:28:25 with a reduced hour requirement of 15 hours.
00:28:30 This should make it possible for many more of us
00:28:34 to share as auxiliary pioneers
00:28:37 during those months of special activity.
00:28:41 What about special pioneers and missionaries?
00:28:45 They will now have an hour requirement
00:28:47 of 100 hours per month.
00:28:51 Sisters who are serving as special pioneers or missionaries
00:28:55 and who are 40 years of age or older
00:28:58 have a reduced hour requirement of 90 hours.
00:29:04 How should we view these adjustments?
00:29:08 This is powerful evidence
00:29:11 of the great love and tender concern
00:29:15 that Jehovah feels for his people.
00:29:18 We want as many as possible
00:29:21 to retain their precious privilege of serving as pioneers.
00:29:26 And we feel that these adjustments will make it possible
00:29:30 for many more to consider taking up the pioneer work.
00:29:35 Since the number of people requesting Bible studies
00:29:39 is increasing worldwide,
00:29:41 there could never be a better time
00:29:44 to expand our share in the ministry.
00:29:48 If you are serving as a pioneer right now,
00:29:52 we hope that you’ll continue.
00:29:55 If you’re not yet serving as a regular pioneer,
00:29:58 would it be possible for you to do so?
00:30:02 And with the Memorial season just ahead,
00:30:05 no doubt all elders, ministerial servants,
00:30:09 and publishers will prayerfully consider
00:30:13 if they can auxiliary pioneer.
00:30:16 Can you do so?
00:30:18 We look to Jehovah to bless all of these arrangements
00:30:22 to his glory and praise!
00:30:25 Yes, may we all continue to do our very best
00:30:30 to find those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life”!
00:30:36 We love you all very much!
