00:00:01 Welcome to our update.
00:00:04 In many parts of the world,
00:00:06 conventions are underway.
00:00:09 In fact, as of early July,
00:00:11 over 2.3 million have attended
00:00:14 the “Exercise Patience”! Regional Conventions in person.
00:00:19 Seeing old friends and making new ones at the conventions
00:00:24 is bringing so much joy to God’s people.
00:00:29 And the program is truly spiritual “food at the proper time.”
00:00:34 Those who have already attended the convention have benefited greatly,
00:00:39 and we assure those who will be attending in the future:
00:00:43 You’re going to love it!
00:00:46 On June 1, tours of many Bethel facilities
00:00:50 resumed worldwide.
00:00:52 This has been so exciting for the visitors and for the Bethel family.
00:01:01 Seeing the first tour group arrive
00:01:03 was exciting, so encouraging,
00:01:05 knowing the efforts that they’d made to come.
00:01:10 In honesty, I don’t know
00:01:11 who was more excited,
00:01:12 the Bethel family or the tour group,
00:01:14 because we really love to have them here.
00:01:19 My favorite part was the amazing surprise
00:01:21 of walking in and everyone being there
00:01:23 and welcoming us and waving
00:01:25 and so many hugs.
00:01:26 It was a great surprise.
00:01:33 The welcome we got was amazing,
00:01:34 and they just kept on coming
00:01:36 and talking to us.
00:01:39 When I think about it,
00:01:40 most of their lives
00:01:42 they’ve been watching updates
00:01:43 about Chelmsford on jw.org.
00:01:45 So to finally be here—
00:01:47 I just never imagined it would be possible.
00:01:57 It has been over a month now
00:01:59 since tours have resumed,
00:02:00 and it has been amazing!
00:02:05 We are originally from the Philippines,
00:02:07 and we are now in Canada.
00:02:09 We drove about eight hours
00:02:11 to get to Warwick Bethel.
00:02:15 We planned to tour Warwick in March of 2020.
00:02:19 Here we are three years later.
00:02:20 We said, “There’s one trip  that we have to plan
00:02:21 and make this year,”
00:02:23 and it was coming to visit Bethel.
00:02:26 I would definitely encourage families to plan the trip.
00:02:29 It’s definitely encouraging spiritually,
00:02:32 but it’s something that your kids are going to remember.
00:02:37 There are so many things in the museum
00:02:40 that you cannot really absorb them in just one visit.
00:02:42 So, hopefully,
00:02:44 we will be back again.
00:02:49 These brothers and sisters echo the inspired words of David,
00:02:54 as recorded at Psalm 122:1:
00:02:58 “I rejoiced when they said to me:
00:03:02 ‘Let us go to the house of Jehovah.’”
00:03:06 We warmly invite you to experience the joy of touring Bethel.
00:03:12 Please make a tour reservation on jw.org.
00:03:17 You can find more information on the “Bethel Tours” page,
00:03:21 or you may contact your local branch office.
00:03:26 As announced on jw.org, on Wednesday evening,
00:03:30 June 28, 2023,
00:03:34 the Ramapo project received a major approval.
00:03:39 The Town of Ramapo Planning Board
00:03:42 unanimously approved the site plan for the project!
00:03:47 Although there are many permits and technical details to work through,
00:03:52 this approval now allows the project to proceed.
00:03:57 We are grateful for the hard work of the Town Planning Board
00:04:01 and all the brothers and sisters working behind the scenes.
00:04:06 And we thank Jehovah for his continued blessing on this project.
00:04:13 In May 2022,
00:04:15 Brother Dennis Christensen was released from prison.
00:04:20 Shortly after, we interviewed him and his wife, Irina.
00:04:25 As you watch the following video,
00:04:27 notice what helped them to endure and remain faithful.
00:04:35 We were at a meeting of our congregation in the city of Oryol.
00:04:42 But then one of our ministerial servants came running to me and said,
00:04:46 “Dennis, you have to go in the hallway.”
00:04:49 “OK, OK.”
00:04:50 I then went in the corridor, and there were people standing there in masks
00:04:55 —a lot of police officers and a lot of FSB people.
00:05:00 They showed their IDs and said that they were going to search our hall.
00:05:08 After that, they also showed me some paper.
00:05:12 It was a ruling that I was the main one in this case
00:05:16 and that they would arrest me for two days.
00:05:21 I thought: ‘It’s no big deal,  and it’s going to be resolved.
00:05:25 ‘Two days is something I can live with.
00:05:27 Other brothers and sisters were in prison before me, and I can do it too.’
00:05:31 And I was sure, too, that Jehovah was protecting me.
00:05:44 The hardest part was being separated from my wife, Irina.
00:05:48 The detention center is located
00:05:51 so that you can’t generally see the prisoners, right?
00:05:55 I tried to find a place where I could see his window.
00:05:59 And just from his window, he could see me well.
00:06:03 And so we agreed that I would go there.
00:06:06 Dennis told me what time.
00:06:10 That was my favorite time, you might say, of the whole day.
00:06:15 I was looking forward to 1:00 p.m.,
00:06:17 my opportunity to see Irina.
00:06:20 It was only five to ten minutes.
00:06:24 For two years we had this routine.
00:06:27 Irina came every day!
00:06:30 In the snow,
00:06:32 in the rain, in bright sunshine
00:06:35 —no matter what the weather was,
00:06:38 every day she was there.
00:06:41 It was our little secret that we reveal now.
00:06:46 For two years, we didn’t tell it to anyone at all.
00:06:52 I really tried my best to be a good husband.
00:06:55 When I was in the detention center,
00:06:58 I tried to call her twice a month.
00:07:01 I tried to write her letters five times a week.
00:07:07 I had friends supporting me, coming over, visiting.
00:07:11 I got a lot of letters, and so did Dennis.
00:07:14 There were people who said,
00:07:16 “If you’re having a hard time, you can call and text; we’ll come over.”
00:07:20 They offered all sorts of help, and I am very grateful to them.
00:07:29 During the trial,
00:07:31 I particularly remembered
00:07:33 the support of the brothers and sisters.
00:07:35 That’s amazing!
00:07:39 Thank you, everybody, for coming.
00:07:40 I am very happy that you are here.
00:07:42 Thank you!
00:07:44 When I got my final sentence of six years,
00:07:47 then there were a lot of people in the audience.
00:07:54 How I dealt with it:
00:07:57 I was very strict about my attitude
00:08:00 because I knew, basically, as it says in Proverbs:
00:08:05 ‘If you’re sad, then your strength also disappears.’
00:08:11 I knew it would be a long struggle, and I wanted to endure.
00:08:17 I tried to read the Bible every day
00:08:20 like I was supposed to and to meditate.
00:08:23 I did have a special notebook
00:08:25 where I wrote down good thoughts from the Bible that would strengthen me.
00:08:32 For example,
00:08:34 I often remembered Isaiah 30:15,
00:08:39 where it says that we have to ‘keep calm and trust in Jehovah.’
00:08:43 And that is our strength.
00:08:48 And very often I prayed
00:08:50 that I’d have peace in my heart,
00:08:52 that Jehovah would help me to keep my joy,
00:08:55 to be happy, because I wanted it to be that way.
00:08:59 I often thought too: ‘Yes, OK, you can steal my freedom.
00:09:04 ‘Yes, you can make me not see my family
00:09:08 ‘and not be able to hug them as often as I’d like.
00:09:12 ‘But inside, I will not let you steal my peace;
00:09:17 ‘I will not let you steal my joy.
00:09:20 ‘I want to be happy, to serve Jehovah,
00:09:23 to do as he wants because he is a happy Father.’
00:09:29 Dennis once wrote this interesting phrase,
00:09:32 “If you want to be happy, make others happy.”
00:09:35 And that thought helped me a lot.
00:09:39 And I was always busy.
00:09:41 I was always looking for opportunities to help someone
00:09:44 —who to visit and who to bring groceries to—
00:09:47 or to visit the sick.
00:09:56 A member of the prison staff said to me,
00:09:58 “Dennis, I can see that you’re very joyful.”
00:10:02 I said: “Yes, I’ll be free soon;
00:10:05 “all my thoughts are there right now.
00:10:09 “It’s like I’m not here.
00:10:11 I’m already out there.”
00:10:14 Then he said to me, “Look, Christensen, you’ve never been here.
00:10:18 “You’ve always been on the outside.
00:10:20 “You’ve always been free.
00:10:22 You’ve always been joyful and happy.”
00:10:25 I also imagined that day many times:
00:10:29 when I’d go out,
00:10:30 when I’d see my brothers and sisters again and my family,
00:10:34 and when I’d hug them.
00:10:50 I was amazed at the number of people who were already there.
00:10:54 They got there early,
00:10:56 and they were people from completely different cities.
00:11:26 We already knew ahead of time that there would be a few people
00:11:30 who would meet us at Copenhagen Airport.
00:11:36 But it was a great feeling
00:11:38 when we saw so many brothers and sisters there
00:11:42 who were shouting with joy.
00:11:46 I hugged everybody.
00:11:48 I had waited a long time for this,
00:11:51 so there were a lot of emotions there.
00:12:01 Now we’re back in Denmark.
00:12:04 Here we have to start a new life, start from scratch.
00:12:14 We had an invaluable and unique experience
00:12:17 that we really want to use to help others.
00:12:24 You could say that prison is a very good school
00:12:27 to polish your Christian qualities.
00:12:32 I’m out now, and I’m very happy about that.
00:12:35 But my prayers for my brothers and sisters
00:12:38 who are still in prison haven’t changed.
00:12:41 On the contrary,
00:12:42 I pray for them even more now because I know what they’re facing there.
00:12:51 It’s not always easy,
00:12:53 but I’m also sure that Jehovah helps them as he helped me.
00:13:09 Brother and Sister Christensen,
00:13:11 thank you for sharing your experience with us.
00:13:15 We’re encouraged by your patient endurance.
00:13:20 I recall many years ago
00:13:22 when I was working with the brothers behind the Iron Curtain,
00:13:25 I saw their faith and integrity.
00:13:29 It was so touching, and that has stayed with me until now.
00:13:34 When we see vivid accounts or hear reports about the faith
00:13:39 and determination of our brothers in countries under ban today,
00:13:44 doesn’t it strengthen and inspire us?
00:13:48 We continue to pray
00:13:50 for the over
180 brothers and sisters worldwide
00:13:55 who are presently in prison for their faith.
00:14:00 As you watched the interview,
00:14:02 did you notice what helped the Christensens to endure?
00:14:07 Brother Christensen said that daily Bible reading
00:14:10 and meditation helped him.
00:14:14 He wrote strengthening thoughts from the Bible in a notebook.
00:14:20 Brother and Sister Christensen encouraged each other
00:14:22 by regular letters and phone calls.
00:14:26 And wasn’t it touching to hear
00:14:28 how seeing each other briefly from a distance strengthened them?
00:14:35 They were also built up by the support of their spiritual family.
00:14:40 And they did not just receive support;
00:14:44 they looked for opportunities to help and encourage others.
00:14:49 Do you remember what Dennis wrote to Irina?
00:14:53 “If you want to be happy, make others happy.”
00:14:58 This reminds us of Jesus’ words
00:15:00 recorded at Acts 20:35:
00:15:04 “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”
00:15:10 One of the scriptures that Dennis said helped him through this trial
00:15:15 was Isaiah 30:15.
00:15:18 There we read:
00:15:20 “Your strength will be in keeping calm
00:15:24 and showing trust.”
00:15:28 We are pleased to inform you that the full interview
00:15:31 of Brother and Sister Christensen will be made available
00:15:34 on jw.org in the future.
00:15:38 Yes, just as Jehovah strengthened the Christensens to endure their trial,
00:15:43 he will help all of us to endure faithfully
00:15:47 as we keep trusting in Jehovah!
00:15:52 Dear brothers and sisters, we take note of your patient endurance.
00:15:57 Please know that we love you all very much.
