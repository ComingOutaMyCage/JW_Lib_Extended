00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:04.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to our update.

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.569 line:10% position:50% align:center
In many parts of the world,

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.196 line:10% position:50% align:center
conventions are underway.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.740 line:10% position:50% align:center
In fact, as of early July,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 2.3 million have attended

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
the “Exercise Patience”!
Regional Conventions in person.

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing old friends
and making new ones at the conventions

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
is bringing so much joy to God’s people.

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:33.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the program is truly
spiritual “food at the proper time.”

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who have already attended
the convention have benefited greatly,

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we assure those
who will be attending in the future:

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to love it!

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
On June 1, tours of many Bethel facilities

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
resumed worldwide.

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has been so exciting
for the visitors and for the Bethel family.

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:03.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
Seeing the first tour group arrive

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.878 line:10% position:50% align:center
was exciting, so encouraging,

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:08.005 line:10% position:50% align:center
knowing the efforts that they’d made to come.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
In honesty, I don’t know

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:12.968 line:10% position:50% align:center
who was more excited,

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:14.386 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Bethel family or the tour group,

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:16.013 line:10% position:50% align:center
because we really love to have them here.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
My favorite part was the amazing surprise

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:23.479 line:10% position:50% align:center
of walking in and everyone being there

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.230 line:10% position:50% align:center
and welcoming us and waving

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.523 line:10% position:50% align:center
and so many hugs.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a great surprise.

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:34.990 line:10% position:50% align:center
The welcome we got was amazing,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.533 line:10% position:50% align:center
and they just kept on coming

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking to us.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I think about it,

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:42.039 line:10% position:50% align:center
most of their lives

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.457 line:10% position:50% align:center
they’ve been watching updates

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.501 line:10% position:50% align:center
about Chelmsford on jw.org.

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to finally be here—

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:49.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just never imagined it would be possible.

00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:59.390 line:10% position:50% align:center
It has been over a month now

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.975 line:10% position:50% align:center
since tours have resumed,

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:02.267 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it has been amazing!

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:07.773 line:10% position:50% align:center
We are originally from the Philippines,

00:02:07.773 --> 00:02:09.900 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we are now in Canada.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.485 line:10% position:50% align:center
We drove about eight hours

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:13.654 line:10% position:50% align:center
to get to Warwick Bethel.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:19.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
We planned to tour Warwick in March of 2020.

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:20.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we are three years later.

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:21.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
We said, “There’s one trip 
that we have to plan

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:23.163 line:10% position:50% align:center
and make this year,”

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:24.456 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it was coming to visit Bethel.

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:29.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would definitely encourage families
to plan the trip.

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s definitely encouraging spiritually,

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s something that your kids
are going to remember.

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:40.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many things in the museum

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you cannot really absorb them
in just one visit.

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:44.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, hopefully,

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be back again.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
These brothers and sisters
echo the inspired words of David,

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:58.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Psalm 122:1:

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:02.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I rejoiced when they said to me:

00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Let us go to the house of Jehovah.’”

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:11.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
We warmly invite you to experience
the joy of touring Bethel.

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:16.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please make a tour reservation on jw.org.

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:21.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can find more information
on the “Bethel Tours” page,

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:25.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you may contact your local branch office.

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
As announced on jw.org,
on Wednesday evening,

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
June 28, 2023,

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:39.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Ramapo project received a major approval.

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:42.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Town of Ramapo Planning Board

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:47.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
unanimously approved
the site plan for the project!

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:52.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although there are many permits
and technical details to work through,

00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:56.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
this approval now allows
the project to proceed.

00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are grateful for the hard work
of the Town Planning Board

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:05.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the brothers and sisters
working behind the scenes.

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:11.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank Jehovah
for his continued blessing on this project.

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
In May 2022,

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Dennis Christensen
was released from prison.

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:24.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after,
we interviewed him and his wife, Irina.

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:27.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:32.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what helped them
to endure and remain faithful.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were at a meeting of our congregation
in the city of Oryol.

00:04:42.928 --> 00:04:46.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then one of our ministerial servants
came running to me and said,

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:49.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dennis, you have to go in the hallway.”

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“OK, OK.”

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:54.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
I then went in the corridor,
and there were people standing there in masks

00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:59.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a lot of police officers
and a lot of FSB people.

00:05:00.654 --> 00:05:04.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed their IDs and said
that they were going to search our hall.

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:12.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, they also showed me some paper.

00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:16.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a ruling that I was
the main one in this case

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they would arrest me for two days.

00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:25.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought: ‘It’s no big deal,
 and it’s going to be resolved.

00:05:25.345 --> 00:05:27.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Two days is something I can live with.

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:31.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other brothers and sisters were in prison
before me, and I can do it too.’

00:05:31.143 --> 00:05:33.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was sure, too,
that Jehovah was protecting me.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hardest part
was being separated from my wife, Irina.

00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:51.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
The detention center is located

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can’t generally
see the prisoners, right?

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:59.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to find a place
where I could see his window.

00:05:59.963 --> 00:06:03.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just from his window,
he could see me well.

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:06.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we agreed that I would go there.

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:08.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dennis told me what time.

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was my favorite time,
you might say, of the whole day.

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:17.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was looking forward to 1:00 p.m.,

00:06:17.397 --> 00:06:20.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
my opportunity to see Irina.

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:22.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was only five to ten minutes.

00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:27.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
For two years we had this routine.

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:30.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irina came every day!

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:32.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the snow,

00:06:32.663 --> 00:06:35.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the rain, in bright sunshine

00:06:35.415 --> 00:06:38.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no matter what the weather was,

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:40.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
every day she was there.

00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:46.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was our little secret that we reveal now.

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:50.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
For two years,
we didn’t tell it to anyone at all.

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:55.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really tried my best to be a good husband.

00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:58.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was in the detention center,

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:01.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to call her twice a month.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to write her letters
five times a week.

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had friends supporting me,
coming over, visiting.

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:14.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got a lot of letters, and so did Dennis.

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:16.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were people who said,

00:07:16.248 --> 00:07:20.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you’re having a hard time,
you can call and text; we’ll come over.”

00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:24.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
They offered all sorts of help,
and I am very grateful to them.

00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:31.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the trial,

00:07:31.013 --> 00:07:33.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
I particularly remembered

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
the support of the brothers and sisters.

00:07:35.684 --> 00:07:38.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s amazing!

00:07:39.062 --> 00:07:40.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, everybody, for coming.

00:07:40.522 --> 00:07:42.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am very happy that you are here.

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:43.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:47.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I got my final sentence of six years,

00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:50.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
then there were a lot of people
in the audience.

00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:57.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
How I dealt with it:

00:07:57.205 --> 00:08:00.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was very strict about my attitude

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:04.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I knew, basically,
as it says in Proverbs:

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:10.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If you’re sad,
then your strength also disappears.’

00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:15.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew it would be a long struggle,
and I wanted to endure.

00:08:17.893 --> 00:08:20.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to read the Bible every day

00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:23.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
like I was supposed to and to meditate.

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:25.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did have a special notebook

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:30.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I wrote down good thoughts
from the Bible that would strengthen me.

00:08:32.657 --> 00:08:34.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:39.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
I often remembered Isaiah 30:15,

00:08:39.998 --> 00:08:43.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says that we
have to ‘keep calm and trust in Jehovah.’

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is our strength.

00:08:48.882 --> 00:08:50.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
And very often I prayed

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:52.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’d have peace in my heart,

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:55.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would help me to keep my joy,

00:08:55.722 --> 00:08:59.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be happy,
because I wanted it to be that way.

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:04.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
I often thought too:
‘Yes, OK, you can steal my freedom.

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:08.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yes, you can make me not see my family

00:09:08.735 --> 00:09:12.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and not be able to hug them
as often as I’d like.

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:17.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘But inside,
I will not let you steal my peace;

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:19.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I will not let you steal my joy.

00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:23.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I want to be happy, to serve Jehovah,

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:27.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do as he wants
because he is a happy Father.’

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:32.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dennis once wrote this interesting phrase,

00:09:32.634 --> 00:09:35.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you want to be happy, make others happy.”

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:38.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that thought helped me a lot.

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:41.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was always busy.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always looking for opportunities
to help someone

00:09:44.604 --> 00:09:47.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
—who to visit and who to bring groceries to—

00:09:47.816 --> 00:09:49.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to visit the sick.

00:09:56.116 --> 00:09:58.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
A member of the prison staff said to me,

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dennis, I can see that you’re very joyful.”

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Yes, I’ll be free soon;

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all my thoughts are there right now.

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:11.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s like I’m not here.

00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:14.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m already out there.”

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he said to me,
“Look, Christensen, you’ve never been here.

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:20.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ve always been on the outside.

00:10:20.807 --> 00:10:22.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ve always been free.

00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:25.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve always been joyful and happy.”

00:10:25.061 --> 00:10:29.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also imagined that day many times:

00:10:29.065 --> 00:10:30.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’d go out,

00:10:30.692 --> 00:10:34.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’d see
my brothers and sisters again and my family,

00:10:34.404 --> 00:10:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when I’d hug them.

00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:54.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was amazed at the number of people
who were already there.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
They got there early,

00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:59.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were people
from completely different cities.

00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:30.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
We already knew ahead of time
that there would be a few people

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:33.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would meet us at Copenhagen Airport.

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:38.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was a great feeling

00:11:38.093 --> 00:11:42.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we saw
so many brothers and sisters there

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were shouting with joy.

00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:48.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hugged everybody.

00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:51.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had waited a long time for this,

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:54.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
so there were a lot of emotions there.

00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:03.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re back in Denmark.

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:08.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we have to start a new life,
start from scratch.

00:12:14.337 --> 00:12:17.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had an invaluable and unique experience

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we really want to use to help others.

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:27.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could say that prison
is a very good school

00:12:27.475 --> 00:12:29.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
to polish your Christian qualities.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m out now, and I’m very happy about that.

00:12:35.525 --> 00:12:38.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
But my prayers for my brothers and sisters

00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:41.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are still in prison haven’t changed.

00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:42.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the contrary,

00:12:42.824 --> 00:12:47.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
I pray for them even more now
because I know what they’re facing there.

00:12:51.666 --> 00:12:53.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not always easy,

00:12:53.668 --> 00:12:58.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m also sure
that Jehovah helps them as he helped me.

00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:11.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Christensen,

00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:14.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
thank you
for sharing your experience with us.

00:13:15.148 --> 00:13:18.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re encouraged by your patient endurance.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall many years ago

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was working with the brothers
behind the Iron Curtain,

00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:29.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw their faith and integrity.

00:13:29.204 --> 00:13:33.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so touching,
and that has stayed with me until now.

00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:39.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we see vivid accounts
or hear reports about the faith

00:13:39.172 --> 00:13:44.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and determination of our brothers
in countries under ban today,

00:13:44.177 --> 00:13:47.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t it strengthen and inspire us?

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:50.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the over
180 brothers and sisters worldwide

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are presently in prison for their faith.

00:14:00.318 --> 00:14:02.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watched the interview,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you notice what helped
the Christensens to endure?

00:14:07.158 --> 00:14:10.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Christensen said
that daily Bible reading

00:14:10.745 --> 00:14:14.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meditation helped him.

00:14:14.207 --> 00:14:18.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote strengthening thoughts
from the Bible in a notebook.

00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:22.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Christensen
encouraged each other

00:14:22.882 --> 00:14:26.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
by regular letters and phone calls.

00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:28.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And wasn’t it touching to hear

00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:33.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
how seeing each other briefly
from a distance strengthened them?

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:40.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were also built up by the support
of their spiritual family.

00:14:40.942 --> 00:14:44.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they did not just receive support;

00:14:44.195 --> 00:14:48.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
they looked for opportunities
to help and encourage others.

00:14:49.909 --> 00:14:53.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what Dennis wrote to Irina?

00:14:53.496 --> 00:14:58.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you want to be happy, make others happy.”

00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:00.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reminds us of Jesus’ words

00:15:00.587 --> 00:15:04.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded at Acts 20:35:

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:08.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is more happiness
in giving than there is in receiving.”

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the scriptures that Dennis
said helped him through this trial

00:15:15.226 --> 00:15:18.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
was Isaiah 30:15.

00:15:18.396 --> 00:15:20.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we read:

00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:24.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your strength will be in keeping calm

00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:26.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showing trust.”

00:15:28.114 --> 00:15:31.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are pleased to inform you
that the full interview

00:15:31.534 --> 00:15:34.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Brother and Sister Christensen
will be made available

00:15:34.537 --> 00:15:37.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org in the future.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:43.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, just as Jehovah strengthened
the Christensens to endure their trial,

00:15:43.922 --> 00:15:47.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will help all of us to endure faithfully

00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:50.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we keep trusting in Jehovah!

00:15:52.472 --> 00:15:57.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,
we take note of your patient endurance.

00:15:57.977 --> 00:16:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please know that we love you all very much.

00:16:03.566 --> 00:16:06.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:09.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
