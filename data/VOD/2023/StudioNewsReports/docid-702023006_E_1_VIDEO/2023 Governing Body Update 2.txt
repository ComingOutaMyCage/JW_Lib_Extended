00:00:01 Welcome!
00:00:02 What an exciting time!
00:00:05 The Memorial season is here,
00:00:07 and the invitation campaign is underway.
00:00:11 And with the new hour requirements for pioneers,
00:00:14 many of us can now share in the pioneer work.
00:00:17 We’ve received so many cards and letters from brothers and sisters
00:00:22 who are thrilled with the new hour requirements for pioneers.
00:00:27 One sister wrote:
00:00:29 “As a mother, wife, homemaker,
00:00:32 “part-time worker, and caretaker for elderly parents,
00:00:36 “you have absolutely no idea what the update did for me today.
00:00:40 “I have tears even as I am writing.
00:00:44 “We are all so tired right now
00:00:46 “but want nothing more than to faithfully serve Jehovah
00:00:50 “and stay active in reaching people in these last days.
00:00:55 “The announcement to reduce the [pioneer] hours
00:00:57 “was such an answer to prayers.
00:01:00 “It was so faith-strengthening
00:01:02 “and a complete reassurance of Jehovah’s love for all of us.
00:01:06 Thank you so much.”
00:01:09 Another sister wrote:
00:01:11 “I just wanted to take a minute to tell you
00:01:13 “how happy I was to get the new information
00:01:17 “on auxiliary pioneer hours.
00:01:19 “I cried.
00:01:21 “I have kidney dialysis three times a week.
00:01:25 “It takes a lot of my strength.
00:01:27 “But 15 hours—I can do that!
00:01:31 What a wonderful God we have!”
00:01:35 These messages no doubt reflect the thoughts and feelings
00:01:38 of many of you dear brothers and sisters.
00:01:41 And isn’t it encouraging that since January 1, 2023,
00:01:46 theocratic schools have resumed in person?
00:01:49 Worldwide, more than 430 classes
00:01:53 of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:01:55 and more than 170 classes
00:01:58 of the School for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives
00:02:01 have been approved for this next year.
00:02:04 Additionally, elders have begun attending in-person classes
00:02:08 of the School for Congregation Elders.
00:02:11 We pray for Jehovah’s rich blessing on these arrangements.
00:02:17 We have another exciting announcement:
00:02:19 We’re very pleased to inform you
00:02:21 that beginning June 1, 2023,
00:02:25 tours of many Bethel facilities will resume worldwide,
00:02:29 in accord with local circumstances.
00:02:32 Initially, for health and safety reasons,
00:02:35 the number of persons permitted to tour Bethel
00:02:38 will be considerably reduced.
00:02:41 If no significant difficulties are encountered,
00:02:44 the number of persons permitted to tour Bethel
00:02:46 will gradually be increased.
00:02:49 The local branch office will provide further details
00:02:53 on this matter later this month.
00:02:57 Since our last update,
00:02:59 we received a very exciting announcement!
00:03:03 On January 18, 2023,
00:03:06 Brothers Gage Fleegle and Jeffrey Winder
00:03:09 were appointed to serve as members of the Governing Body.
00:03:13 We’re happy to have them with us here in the studio,
00:03:17 and we’d like to spend a few minutes together
00:03:19 so that you can get to know them a bit.
00:03:24 Well, brothers, we understand that you were both raised in the truth
00:03:29 by your Christian parents.
00:03:31 So, what helped you to come to love Jehovah and want to serve him?
00:03:36 Jeff, we’ll start with you.
00:03:38 Having parents
00:03:39 who were well-grounded in the truth
00:03:41 really did make a big difference
00:03:43 to help us children choose the right path.
00:03:46 And we always knew and loved the truth.
00:03:49 But as I got older, particularly my mid-teen years,
00:03:53 the truth really became more personal and more real to me.
00:03:58 It’s almost like it kind of went from black and white to color
00:04:03 as it became more personal in that way.
00:04:05 And the district convention in 1985, as it was then called,
00:04:09 had a deep impact on me,
00:04:11 particularly the baptism talk
00:04:13 and the concluding talk really spoke to me.
00:04:17 And I could tell I was just beginning to make the truth my own during that time.
00:04:20 So by the following year, beginning of the calendar year,
00:04:24 I dedicated my life to Jehovah and got baptized.
00:04:27 Very nice.
00:04:28 Thank you, Brother Winder, for sharing that.
00:04:31 Gage, we’ll ask you the same question —get your thoughts on it.
00:04:34 Well, as was true with Jeff,
00:04:37 home was fertile soil
00:04:40 for my brothers and my sister and me
00:04:42 to grow spiritually.
00:04:45 Both of my parents were living examples of faith.
00:04:49 My father took advantage of the opportunities to teach us about creation
00:04:53 and what this revealed about Jehovah’s qualities, his personality.
00:04:56 I have precious memories of getting up early
00:05:00 and watching the sunrise with him.
00:05:02 My mom—she started regular pioneering
00:05:06 when I was 11 years old and has continued to this day.
00:05:09 Her constant example of putting Jehovah first
00:05:12 definitely made a deep impression in my mind,
00:05:16 and I was able to join her in the regular pioneer ministry
00:05:19 my senior year of high school until I was able to go to Bethel.
00:05:24 Well, what nice comments, brothers! We want to know more.
00:05:26 So here’s another question:
00:05:29 What motivated you to pursue full-time service and Bethel service?
00:05:32 And, Jeff, please.
00:05:34 For me, good association played a big role.
00:05:39 As it turned out, at the circuit assembly that I got baptized at,
00:05:43 several other young brothers from our congregation got baptized as well.
00:05:47 And at the end of that assembly,
00:05:49 it occurred to us that we could auxiliary pioneer now.
00:05:52 And so we decided to do it the very next month.
00:05:55 And we loved it so much;
00:05:57 we pioneered the following month and all through that summer.
00:06:01 And by then, we were hooked. We loved it.
00:06:03 And three of us went directly into regular pioneering from there.
00:06:07 As for Bethel service,
00:06:09 my two older brothers served at Wallkill before me,
00:06:12 when I was just a teenager.
00:06:14 And we had an opportunity to visit while they were there.
00:06:17 And just seeing Bethel and seeing all that took place there
00:06:20 really instilled in me the desire to want to serve at Bethel
00:06:24 when I became old enough.
00:06:25 Very good.
00:06:26 And, Gage, what motivated you?
00:06:29 Well, full-time service was the right thing to do.
00:06:33 To me, dedication to Jehovah
00:06:36 and serving him in the fullest capacity possible
00:06:39 go hand in hand.
00:06:41 So that was always the goal that my parents had set before us.
00:06:45 We always had special full-time servants who would stay at the house
00:06:48 —circuit overseers and Bethel family members.
00:06:51 They would stay, and seeing their joy
00:06:54 is something that motivated me along those lines as well.
00:06:57 At age 12, I was able to attend
00:07:00 a Bethel meeting at the regional convention back at that time,
00:07:03 and so it became crystallized in my mind that was the direction I wanted to go.
00:07:07 Very good.
00:07:08 Well, you started at a very young age having an interest in Bethel service.
00:07:11 That’s delightful to see.
00:07:13 The third question for you,
00:07:15 What have been some of your assignments at Bethel,
00:07:19 and how have you benefited from them?
00:07:21 Jeff.
00:07:22 Well, I began Bethel at Wallkill,
00:07:24 and my first assignment was in the Cleaning Department.
00:07:27 And, for me, starting Bethel service in cleaning was an excellent way to start
00:07:32 because Bethel can really teach you some very valuable qualities,
00:07:37 like obedience and patience and humility.
00:07:41 And starting off in a support department, like cleaning,
00:07:44 I felt like it really gave me a good head start
00:07:46 in developing these qualities that would be useful the rest of my life.
00:07:51 After that, I was transferred to the Farm Department,
00:07:53 and I worked in what was like produce processing at Wallkill.
00:07:58 And again, it was just a lot of fun
00:08:00 —good brothers and sisters who worked there, spiritual men and women—
00:08:03 and a lot of hard work but that I thoroughly enjoyed.
00:08:06 And it was about three years that I worked in that department.
00:08:10 And then I was transferred to the office,
00:08:13 and that began a period of about 22 years
00:08:16 of serving as a secretary for various brothers
00:08:19 and various aspects of the work there at Wallkill.
00:08:23 And during that time, I had the privilege to work
00:08:26 along with brothers who had served Jehovah for years
00:08:30 and had deep experience and wisdom and knowledge
00:08:33 on how to administer the work at Bethel.
00:08:35 And that really molded me and taught me things
00:08:38 that I drew on in future assignments
00:08:40 and that I continue to draw on today.
00:08:44 And, of course, during that time, you and I had the privilege
00:08:46 to work together for about ten years in the Bethel Office.
00:08:48 In 2016,
00:08:50 I had quite a surprise when we were transferred to Patterson
00:08:54 and I was asked to work with Audio/Video Services Department.
00:08:57 I knew nothing about making videos or audio products,
00:09:02 but the brothers and sisters there were so patient with me
00:09:05 and answered all my questions.
00:09:06 And, in time, then I began to learn the work
00:09:08 and really came to love it and enjoy it.
00:09:12 It’s a very interesting work
00:09:14 and such a huge privilege to contribute to the production of spiritual food.
00:09:19 And I really came to love the brothers and sisters in that department.
00:09:23 And then in 2020, another big surprise was
00:09:25 when I was asked to transfer (we were asked to transfer) to Warwick.
00:09:28 And I was asked to work in the Personnel Committee Office
00:09:33 —again with just a solid group of very skilled and devoted brothers
00:09:37 in that office, who I’ve thoroughly enjoyed.
00:09:40 Well, thank you, Jeff, for going through that background with us.
00:09:42 We enjoyed hearing that.
00:09:43 And, Gage, now for you:
00:09:45 What have been some of your assignments and the benefits that have come from that?
00:09:49 Well, I started working in the Bindery.
00:09:51 I worked in the Bindery for eight years.
00:09:54 And that taught me the value of being punctual,
00:09:57 working hard, getting the job done
00:09:59 —even if it was very hot, conditions weren’t always the best—
00:10:03 and also the value of working
00:10:06 with people of different backgrounds
00:10:09 (different cultures, completely different from what I was accustomed to)
00:10:13 and working together in unity and peace.
00:10:16 Then I was transferred to the Service Department,
00:10:19 an office environment —completely different from the Bindery.
00:10:22 But I learned there the importance of getting all the facts
00:10:26 before commenting on a matter,
00:10:28 the importance of many advisers,
00:10:32 consulting with different brothers before sending direction out,
00:10:35 and also the practical value of Jehovah’s Word.
00:10:39 Whether it’s a personal issue, whether it’s a family issue,
00:10:43 whether it’s a congregation issue,
00:10:45 Jehovah’s Word is practical in all of those scenarios.
00:10:48 And then in 2015,
00:10:50 I was asked to work with the Teaching Committee Office.
00:10:54 And there I learned that
00:10:56 it’s not simply preparing “delightful words”
00:10:59 for the international brotherhood
00:11:03 but also the importance of accurate words
00:11:06 —preparing that for the brotherhood
00:11:09 and seeing Jehovah’s spirit make sure
00:11:12 that the completed project came about.
00:11:16 Thank you very much, Gage.
00:11:18 We enjoyed hearing that background from both of you brothers
00:11:21 and how you’ve benefited from it.
00:11:22 But we’re going to bring it right now back to the Scriptures and this thought:
00:11:26 Is there a Scriptural thought that has strengthened you
00:11:29 as you begin this new assignment?
00:11:32 And, Jeff, we’ll start with you again.
00:11:34 There is.
00:11:35 In recent weeks and months,
00:11:37 we’ve really come to hang on to a couple of verses in Isaiah 26.
00:11:41 And particularly with this assignment,
00:11:44 I know that I could not accomplish this assignment on my own,
00:11:48 and there have been moments of feeling a bit overwhelmed.
00:11:51 But here in Isaiah 26, it’s so reassuring from Jehovah.
00:11:56 Verse 12 says:
00:11:57 “O Jehovah, you will grant us peace,
00:12:00 “because everything we have done
00:12:03 you have accomplished for us.”
00:12:06 I feel like Jehovah is just reassuring me,
00:12:08 ‘You’re not going to have to do it on your own’
00:12:10 and that Jehovah would help me.
00:12:13 And I love that it’s in the past tense
00:12:15 —“everything we have done you have accomplished”—
00:12:17 because we have history with Jehovah.
00:12:19 I’ve seen him specifically helping me in past assignments
00:12:24 to accomplish things that I knew I couldn’t have done on my own,
00:12:27 but Jehovah helped.
00:12:28 And so then that reassures me.
00:12:30 And as the verse says, it gives me peace.
00:12:33 And in verse 3, it develops that even further.
00:12:36 It says:
00:12:37 “You will safeguard those who fully lean on you;
00:12:41 you will give them continuous peace, because it is in you that they trust.”
00:12:46 So there’s this connection between trusting in Jehovah,
00:12:49 or fully leaning on him, and having continuous peace.
00:12:52 So if I’ve had those moments
00:12:55 where I begin to feel a bit anxious or overwhelmed,
00:12:57 this scripture comes to mind.
00:12:59 ‘Don’t forget, fully lean on Jehovah.
00:13:02 Jehovah is going to do the job.’
00:13:04 And then that peace can resume.
00:13:07 Beautiful set of scriptures there to share with us.
00:13:09 We appreciate that.
00:13:10 Brother Fleegle, same question for you.
00:13:13 I also have two verses.
00:13:15 The first one is Mark 14:36,
00:13:18 Jesus’ words on the night before his death.
00:13:20 He said to his Father in prayer:
00:13:22 “Not what I want, but what you want.”
00:13:26 So my wife and I are a bit shy and reserved,
00:13:30 so this is not the assignment
00:13:33 that we naturally would prefer.
00:13:36 But our life is not our own,
00:13:38 and Jehovah guides us, our steps, according to his will.
00:13:42 And then the other verse is found
00:13:44 at Isaiah 41:10,
00:13:49 comforting words from Jehovah:
00:13:51 “Do not be afraid, for I am with you.
00:13:54 “Do not be anxious, for I am your God.
00:13:57 I will fortify you, yes, I will help you.”
00:14:01 So it’s comforting to know that Jehovah doesn’t expect more of us
00:14:05 than we’re able to accomplish with his help.
00:14:08 So that’s definitely comforting as we’re moving forward in this assignment.
00:14:12 What great Scriptural thoughts, Gage!
00:14:14 Thank you very much for sharing those and, both of you brothers,
00:14:17 for sharing all of your comments with us.
00:14:19 We love having you on the Governing Body,
00:14:22 and we wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing
00:14:25 on your new assignment.
00:14:29 It’s wonderful to see Jehovah’s people busier than ever in Kingdom work.
00:14:34 We know this Memorial season will be filled with joyful activity
00:14:38 as we search for honesthearted ones in the ministry.
00:14:42 May Jehovah richly bless each of you dear brothers and sisters.
