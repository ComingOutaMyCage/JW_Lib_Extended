00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:02.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.151 line:10% position:50% align:center
What an exciting time!

00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:07.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Memorial season is here,

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:11.157 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the invitation campaign is underway.

00:00:11.157 --> 00:00:14.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the new
hour requirements for pioneers,

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:17.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of us can now share in the pioneer work.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve received so many cards and letters
from brothers and sisters

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:27.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are thrilled
with the new hour requirements for pioneers.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister wrote:

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:32.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a mother, wife, homemaker,

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.390 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90% position:50% align:center

what the update did for me today.

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:44.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have tears even as I am writing.

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:46.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are all so tired right now

“but want nothing more
than to faithfully serve Jehovah

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and stay active in reaching people
in these last days.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The announcement
to reduce the [pioneer] hours

00:00:57.787 --> 00:01:00.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was such an answer to prayers.

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:02.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was so faith-strengthening

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:06.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a complete reassurance
of Jehovah’s love for all of us.

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:08.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.”

00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:11.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another sister wrote:

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I just wanted to take a minute to tell you

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“how happy I was to get the new information

00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center

“It takes a lot of my strength.

“But 15 hours—I can do that!

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a wonderful God we have!”

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:38.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
These messages
no doubt reflect the thoughts and feelings

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:41.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
of many of you dear brothers and sisters.

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:46.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it encouraging
that since January 1, 2023,

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:49.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
theocratic schools have resumed in person?

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Worldwide, more than 430 classes

00:01:53.343 --> 00:01:55.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:01:55.887 --> 00:01:58.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more than 170 classes

00:01:58.473 --> 00:02:01.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the School for Circuit Overseers
and Their Wives

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:03.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been approved for this next year.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, elders have begun attending
in-person classes

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:11.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the School for Congregation Elders.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for Jehovah’s rich blessing
on these arrangements.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have another exciting announcement:

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very pleased to inform you

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:25.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
that beginning June 1, 2023,

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:29.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
tours of many Bethel facilities
will resume worldwide,

00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:32.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
in accord with local circumstances.

00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:35.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Initially, for health and safety reasons,

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:38.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of persons
permitted to tour Bethel

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:41.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be considerably reduced.

00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:44.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
If no significant difficulties
are encountered,

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:46.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of persons
permitted to tour Bethel

00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:49.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
will gradually be increased.

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:53.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
The local branch office
will provide further details

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this matter later this month.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since our last update,

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:03.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
we received a very exciting announcement!

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:06.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
On January 18, 2023,

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Gage Fleegle and Jeffrey Winder

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
were appointed to serve
as members of the Governing Body.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:17.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to have them with us
here in the studio,

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’d like to spend a few minutes together

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can get to know them a bit.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:29.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, brothers, we understand
that you were both raised in the truth

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
by your Christian parents.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:36.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what helped you to come to love Jehovah
and want to serve him?

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeff, we’ll start with you.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:39.594 line:10% position:50% align:center
Having parents

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.262 line:10% position:50% align:center
who were well-grounded in the truth

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.264 line:10% position:50% align:center
really did make a big difference

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.851 line:10% position:50% align:center
to help us children choose the right path.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:49.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we always knew and loved the truth.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:53.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as I got older,
particularly my mid-teen years,

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:58.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
the truth really became more personal
and more real to me.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:03.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s almost like it kind of went
from black and white to color

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it became more personal in that way.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:09.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the district convention in 1985,
as it was then called,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a deep impact on me,

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly the baptism talk

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:17.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the concluding talk really spoke to me.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:20.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I could tell I was just beginning
to make the truth my own during that time.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by the following year,
beginning of the calendar year,

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
I dedicated my life to Jehovah
and got baptized.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very nice.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Winder, for sharing that.

00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:34.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gage, we’ll ask you the same question
—get your thoughts on it.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.777 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, as was true with Jeff,

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.030 line:10% position:50% align:center
home was fertile soil

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.908 line:10% position:50% align:center
for my brothers and my sister and me

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:45.035 line:10% position:50% align:center
to grow spiritually.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:49.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of my parents
were living examples of faith.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father took advantage of the opportunities
to teach us about creation

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:56.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what this revealed
about Jehovah’s qualities, his personality.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:00.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have precious memories of getting up early

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:02.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and watching the sunrise with him.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:06.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom—she started regular pioneering

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was 11 years old
and has continued to this day.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her constant example of putting Jehovah first

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:16.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
definitely made a deep impression in my mind,

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:19.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was able to join her
in the regular pioneer ministry

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
my senior year of high school
until I was able to go to Bethel.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what nice comments, brothers!
We want to know more.

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:29.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s another question:

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
What motivated you to pursue
full-time service and Bethel service?

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Jeff, please.

00:05:34.877 --> 00:05:39.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me, good association played a big role.

00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:43.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it turned out, at the circuit assembly
that I got baptized at,

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:47.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
several other young brothers
from our congregation got baptized as well.

00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:49.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at the end of that assembly,

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:52.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
it occurred to us
that we could auxiliary pioneer now.

00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:55.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we decided to do it
the very next month.

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we loved it so much;

00:05:57.608 --> 00:06:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
we pioneered the following month
and all through that summer.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by then, we were hooked.
We loved it.

00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:07.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
And three of us went directly
into regular pioneering from there.

00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:09.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for Bethel service,

00:06:09.453 --> 00:06:12.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
my two older brothers
served at Wallkill before me,

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:14.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was just a teenager.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we had an opportunity to visit
while they were there.

00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:20.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just seeing Bethel
and seeing all that took place there

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:24.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
really instilled in me the desire
to want to serve at Bethel

00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:25.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I became old enough.

00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:26.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Gage, what motivated you?

00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:33.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, full-time service
was the right thing to do.

00:06:33.102 --> 00:06:36.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
To me, dedication to Jehovah

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serving him
in the fullest capacity possible

00:06:39.317 --> 00:06:41.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
go hand in hand.

00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:45.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was always the goal
that my parents had set before us.

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:48.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
We always had special full-time servants
who would stay at the house

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:51.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
—circuit overseers and Bethel family members.

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:54.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would stay,
and seeing their joy

00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:57.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
is something that motivated me
along those lines as well.

00:06:57.376 --> 00:07:00.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
At age 12, I was able to attend

00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:03.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Bethel meeting
at the regional convention back at that time,

00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:07.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so it became crystallized in my mind
that was the direction I wanted to go.

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:08.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good.

00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:11.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you started at a very young age
having an interest in Bethel service.

00:07:11.307 --> 00:07:13.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s delightful to see.

00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third question for you,

00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:19.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have been
some of your assignments at Bethel,

00:07:19.524 --> 00:07:21.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how have you benefited from them?

00:07:21.526 --> 00:07:22.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeff.

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:24.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I began Bethel at Wallkill,

00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:27.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my first assignment
was in the Cleaning Department.

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, for me, starting Bethel service
in cleaning was an excellent way to start

00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:37.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Bethel can really teach you
some very valuable qualities,

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:41.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
like obedience and patience and humility.

00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:44.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
And starting off
in a support department, like cleaning,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like it really gave me
a good head start

00:07:46.468 --> 00:07:50.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
in developing these qualities
that would be useful the rest of my life.

00:07:51.473 --> 00:07:53.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, I was transferred
to the Farm Department,

00:07:53.933 --> 00:07:58.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I worked in what was
like produce processing at Wallkill.

00:07:58.355 --> 00:08:00.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again, it was just a lot of fun

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:03.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
—good brothers and sisters who worked there,
spiritual men and women—

00:08:03.193 --> 00:08:06.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a lot of hard work
but that I thoroughly enjoyed.

00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:10.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was about three years
that I worked in that department.

00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:13.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I was transferred to the office,

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:16.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that began a period of about 22 years

00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:19.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
of serving as a secretary
for various brothers

00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:23.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and various aspects of the work
there at Wallkill.

00:08:23.713 --> 00:08:26.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during that time,
I had the privilege to work

00:08:26.716 --> 00:08:30.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with brothers
who had served Jehovah for years

00:08:30.137 --> 00:08:33.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had deep experience
and wisdom and knowledge

00:08:33.306 --> 00:08:35.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how to administer the work at Bethel.

00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:38.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really molded me
and taught me things

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I drew on in future assignments

00:08:40.605 --> 00:08:44.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I continue to draw on today.

00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:46.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, during that time,
you and I had the privilege

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work together
for about ten years in the Bethel Office.

00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:50.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2016,

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had quite a surprise
when we were transferred to Patterson

00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:57.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was asked to work
with Audio/Video Services Department.

00:08:57.623 --> 00:09:02.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew nothing about making videos
or audio products,

00:09:02.211 --> 00:09:05.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the brothers and sisters there
were so patient with me

00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:06.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
and answered all my questions.

00:09:06.507 --> 00:09:08.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, in time, then I began to learn the work

00:09:08.842 --> 00:09:12.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really came to love it and enjoy it.

00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:14.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a very interesting work

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:19.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
and such a huge privilege to contribute
to the production of spiritual food.

00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:23.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I really came to love
the brothers and sisters in that department.

00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:25.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in 2020,
another big surprise was

00:09:25.901 --> 00:09:28.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was asked to transfer
(we were asked to transfer) to Warwick.

00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:33.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was asked to work
in the Personnel Committee Office

00:09:33.367 --> 00:09:37.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
—again with just a solid group
of very skilled and devoted brothers

00:09:37.538 --> 00:09:39.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that office, who I’ve thoroughly enjoyed.

00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:42.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you, Jeff,
for going through that background with us.

00:09:42.543 --> 00:09:43.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
We enjoyed hearing that.

00:09:43.961 --> 00:09:45.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Gage, now for you:

00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:49.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have been some of your assignments
and the benefits that have come from that?

00:09:49.216 --> 00:09:51.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I started working in the Bindery.

00:09:51.552 --> 00:09:54.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worked in the Bindery for eight years.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that taught me
the value of being punctual,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
working hard, getting the job done

00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even if it was very hot,
conditions weren’t always the best—

00:10:03.606 --> 00:10:06.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also the value of working

00:10:06.692 --> 00:10:09.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
with people of different backgrounds

00:10:09.695 --> 00:10:13.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
(different cultures, completely different
from what I was accustomed to)

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:16.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and working together in unity and peace.

00:10:16.661 --> 00:10:19.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I was transferred
to the Service Department,

00:10:19.246 --> 00:10:22.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
an office environment
—completely different from the Bindery.

00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:26.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I learned there the importance
of getting all the facts

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
before commenting on a matter,

00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:32.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
the importance of many advisers,

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:35.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
consulting with different brothers
before sending direction out,

00:10:35.638 --> 00:10:39.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also the practical value
of Jehovah’s Word.

00:10:39.058 --> 00:10:43.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether it’s a personal issue,
whether it’s a family issue,

00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:45.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s a congregation issue,

00:10:45.064 --> 00:10:48.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Word is practical
in all of those scenarios.

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:50.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in 2015,

00:10:50.903 --> 00:10:54.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was asked to work
with the Teaching Committee Office.

00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:56.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there I learned that

00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:59.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not simply preparing “delightful words”

00:10:59.912 --> 00:11:03.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the international brotherhood

00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:06.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also the importance of accurate words

00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:09.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
—preparing that for the brotherhood

00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:12.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing Jehovah’s spirit make sure

00:11:12.008 --> 00:11:16.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the completed project came about.

00:11:16.387 --> 00:11:18.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, Gage.

00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:21.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
We enjoyed hearing that background
from both of you brothers

00:11:21.142 --> 00:11:22.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how you’ve benefited from it.

00:11:22.977 --> 00:11:26.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re going to bring it right now
back to the Scriptures and this thought:

00:11:26.981 --> 00:11:29.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a Scriptural thought
that has strengthened you

00:11:29.359 --> 00:11:32.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you begin this new assignment?

00:11:32.153 --> 00:11:34.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Jeff, we’ll start with you again.

00:11:34.197 --> 00:11:35.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is.

00:11:35.532 --> 00:11:37.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent weeks and months,

00:11:37.158 --> 00:11:41.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve really come to hang on
to a couple of verses in Isaiah 26.

00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:44.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
And particularly with this assignment,

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:48.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that I could not accomplish
this assignment on my own,

00:11:48.962 --> 00:11:51.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there have been moments
of feeling a bit overwhelmed.

00:11:51.965 --> 00:11:56.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here in Isaiah 26,
it’s so reassuring from Jehovah.

00:11:56.386 --> 00:11:57.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 12 says:

00:11:57.762 --> 00:12:00.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, you will grant us peace,

00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:03.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because everything we have done

00:12:03.143 --> 00:12:06.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have accomplished for us.”

00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:08.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like Jehovah is just reassuring me,

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’re not going to have to
do it on your own’

00:12:10.525 --> 00:12:13.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Jehovah would help me.

00:12:13.153 --> 00:12:15.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I love that it’s in the past tense

00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:17.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“everything we have done
you have accomplished”—

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we have history with Jehovah.

00:12:19.743 --> 00:12:24.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen him specifically helping me
in past assignments

00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish things that I knew
I couldn’t have done on my own,

00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:28.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah helped.

00:12:28.794 --> 00:12:30.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so then that reassures me.

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:33.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the verse says, it gives me peace.

00:12:33.298 --> 00:12:36.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in verse 3,
it develops that even further.

00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:37.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:41.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will safeguard those
who fully lean on you;

00:12:41.014 --> 00:12:46.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will give them continuous peace,
because it is in you that they trust.”

00:12:46.645 --> 00:12:49.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s this connection
between trusting in Jehovah,

00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:52.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
or fully leaning on him,
and having continuous peace.

00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:55.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if I’ve had those moments

00:12:55.154 --> 00:12:57.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I begin to feel
a bit anxious or overwhelmed,

00:12:57.698 --> 00:12:59.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
this scripture comes to mind.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t forget, fully lean on Jehovah.

00:13:02.202 --> 00:13:04.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is going to do the job.’

00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:06.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then that peace can resume.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful set of scriptures
there to share with us.

00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:10.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate that.

00:13:10.836 --> 00:13:13.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Fleegle, same question for you.

00:13:13.672 --> 00:13:15.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also have two verses.

00:13:15.507 --> 00:13:18.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is Mark 14:36,

00:13:18.635 --> 00:13:20.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ words on the night before his death.

00:13:20.888 --> 00:13:22.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to his Father in prayer:

00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:25.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not what I want, but what you want.”

00:13:26.977 --> 00:13:30.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my wife and I are a bit shy and reserved,

00:13:30.648 --> 00:13:33.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
so this is not the assignment

00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:36.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we naturally would prefer.

00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:38.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our life is not our own,

00:13:38.614 --> 00:13:42.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah guides us, our steps,
according to his will.

00:13:42.117 --> 00:13:44.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the other verse is found

00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:49.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 41:10,

00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:51.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
comforting words from Jehovah:

00:13:51.502 --> 00:13:54.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:13:57.383 --> 00:14:01.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will fortify you, yes, I will help you.”

00:14:01.137 --> 00:14:05.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s comforting to know
that Jehovah doesn’t expect more of us

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:08.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
than we’re able to accomplish with his help.

00:14:08.352 --> 00:14:12.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s definitely comforting
as we’re moving forward in this assignment.

00:14:12.815 --> 00:14:14.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
What great Scriptural thoughts, Gage!

00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:17.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much for sharing those
and, both of you brothers,

00:14:17.278 --> 00:14:19.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
for sharing all of your comments with us.

00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:22.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love having you on the Governing Body,

00:14:22.867 --> 00:14:25.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing

00:14:25.161 --> 00:14:27.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your new assignment.

00:14:29.457 --> 00:14:34.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s wonderful to see Jehovah’s people
busier than ever in Kingdom work.

00:14:34.462 --> 00:14:38.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know this Memorial season
will be filled with joyful activity

00:14:38.716 --> 00:14:42.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we search
for honesthearted ones in the ministry.

00:14:42.595 --> 00:14:46.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah richly bless
each of you dear brothers and sisters.

00:14:47.558 --> 00:14:50.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:14:50.853 --> 00:14:54.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.
