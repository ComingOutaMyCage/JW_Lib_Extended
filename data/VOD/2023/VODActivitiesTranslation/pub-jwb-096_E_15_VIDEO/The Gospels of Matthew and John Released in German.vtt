December 18, 2021,
saw the fulfillment

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what many deaf people in Germany
had wished for.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two complete Bible books,
the Gospels of Matthew and John,

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
were released in German Sign Language.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.418 line:10% position:50% align:center
According to 1 Timothy 2:4,

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.253 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants all people

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.547 line:10% position:50% align:center
to “come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.”

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:27.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up to now,

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:29.466 line:10% position:50% align:center
there were just individual Bible verses

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.886 line:10% position:50% align:center
and a few videos in German Sign Language.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
But often the entire context
of a Bible passage was unclear.

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly why
the two newly released Bible books

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
in German Sign Language
are so valuable.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:45.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
A hearing person tends to think
that just by reading a verse,

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
the correct conclusion can be drawn.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:49.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for a deaf person, that is not the case.

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:52.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, John 4:36 mentions

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“gathering fruit for everlasting life.”

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:58.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
A deaf person now thinks:
‘A fruit can give me everlasting life?

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:00.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where can I get that fruit?’

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:04.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the sign-language translation,
it’s now much easier to understand

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:06.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s about bringing people to the truth

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can live forever and we as well.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always exciting for us
to hear about the challenges

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
people in our branch territory have to face,

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:17.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are still able to get
to know the truth.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.351 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I was just nine years old,

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:22.353 line:10% position:50% align:center
I already wanted to become a nun

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I thought
that nuns are closer to Jesus.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always fascinated by Jesus,

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:29.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible, and God,

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I enjoyed looking at my children’s Bible.

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
A friend of mine at school and her parents
were very religious,

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:38.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they studied the Bible a lot.

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:39.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
I liked that.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through her, I heard
about the Christian Association of the Deaf,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I also became a member
of that organization.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:47.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
They discussed a lot of things,

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:50.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t find any answers
to my questions.

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:52.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
After I left that organization,

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
it looked like I would never find
the true path to God and his Son, Jesus.

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:01.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the door-to-door ministry,
the brothers used books as a basis

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then had to sign
the individual paragraphs themselves.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
A short time later,
Jehovah’s Witnesses came to my door.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:12.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought they had made up
the name Jehovah themselves.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they showed me
that God’s name is in the Bible

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:18.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that there’s no such thing as hell,

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:21.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was very surprised and invited them in.

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:23.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked for five hours.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so relieved and wanted to know more.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:30.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why I started
a personal Bible course with the Witnesses.

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I received answers to all my questions
—exactly what I’d been looking for!

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:38.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, it wasn’t all that easy.

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
The text was read and then signed.

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very tiring to follow.

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:47.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
But since I knew that this was the truth,
it was worth all the effort.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was also difficult later when I wanted
to find out something for myself.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ever since I was a child,
I didn’t like reading.

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no other religious organization
in Germany

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has published entire books of the Bible
in German Sign Language.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:04.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s support,

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:08.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
our team has put together
a truly beautiful Bible translation.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
This translation is reliable and dignified

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:13.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
—exactly what we would expect of God’s Word!

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:17.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so thankful to Jehovah,

00:03:17.342 --> 00:03:20.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was overjoyed
as the two Gospels, Matthew and John,

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:23.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
were released in German Sign Language.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had searched long for answers,

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now Jehovah has given me
this wonderful gift.

00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:34.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can hardly wait
to use the Bible in the field ministry

00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:37.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to show other deaf ones God’s Word,

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:42.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
not as text,
but signed in their language.
