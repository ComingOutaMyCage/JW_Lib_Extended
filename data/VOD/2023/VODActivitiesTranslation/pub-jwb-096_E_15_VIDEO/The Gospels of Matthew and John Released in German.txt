00:00:01 December 18, 2021, saw the fulfillment
00:00:05 of what many deaf people in Germany had wished for.
00:00:11 Two complete Bible books, the Gospels of Matthew and John,
00:00:16 were released in German Sign Language.
00:00:20 According to 1 Timothy 2:4,
00:00:22 Jehovah wants all people
00:00:24 to “come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.”
00:00:26 Up to now,
00:00:27 there were just individual Bible verses
00:00:29 and a few videos in German Sign Language.
00:00:31 But often the entire context of a Bible passage was unclear.
00:00:35 And that’s exactly why the two newly released Bible books
00:00:38 in German Sign Language are so valuable.
00:00:41 A hearing person tends to think that just by reading a verse,
00:00:45 the correct conclusion can be drawn.
00:00:47 But for a deaf person, that is not the case.
00:00:49 For example, John 4:36 mentions
00:00:52 “gathering fruit for everlasting life.”
00:00:55 A deaf person now thinks: ‘A fruit can give me everlasting life?
00:00:58 Where can I get that fruit?’
00:01:00 Through the sign-language translation, it’s now much easier to understand
00:01:04 that it’s about bringing people to the truth
00:01:06 so that they can live forever and we as well.
00:01:09 It’s always exciting for us to hear about the challenges
00:01:12 people in our branch territory have to face,
00:01:15 and they are still able to get to know the truth.
00:01:18 When I was just nine years old,
00:01:20 I already wanted to become a nun
00:01:22 because I thought that nuns are closer to Jesus.
00:01:25 I was always fascinated by Jesus,
00:01:27 the Bible, and God,
00:01:29 and I enjoyed looking at my children’s Bible.
00:01:32 A friend of mine at school and her parents were very religious,
00:01:36 and they studied the Bible a lot.
00:01:38 I liked that.
00:01:39 Through her, I heard about the Christian Association of the Deaf,
00:01:42 and I also became a member of that organization.
00:01:45 They discussed a lot of things,
00:01:47 but I didn’t find any answers to my questions.
00:01:50 After I left that organization,
00:01:52 it looked like I would never find the true path to God and his Son, Jesus.
00:01:58 In the door-to-door ministry, the brothers used books as a basis
00:02:01 and then had to sign the individual paragraphs themselves.
00:02:05 A short time later, Jehovah’s Witnesses came to my door.
00:02:09 I thought they had made up the name Jehovah themselves.
00:02:13 When they showed me that God’s name is in the Bible
00:02:15 and that there’s no such thing as hell,
00:02:18 I was very surprised and invited them in.
00:02:21 We talked for five hours.
00:02:23 I was so relieved and wanted to know more.
00:02:26 That’s why I started a personal Bible course with the Witnesses.
00:02:30 And I received answers to all my questions —exactly what I’d been looking for!
00:02:35 However, it wasn’t all that easy.
00:02:38 The text was read and then signed.
00:02:40 It was very tiring to follow.
00:02:42 But since I knew that this was the truth, it was worth all the effort.
00:02:47 It was also difficult later when I wanted to find out something for myself.
00:02:51 Ever since I was a child, I didn’t like reading.
00:02:55 There is no other religious organization in Germany
00:02:58 that has published entire books of the Bible in German Sign Language.
00:03:03 With Jehovah’s support,
00:03:04 our team has put together a truly beautiful Bible translation.
00:03:08 This translation is reliable and dignified
00:03:11 —exactly what we would expect of God’s Word!
00:03:14 I’m so thankful to Jehovah,
00:03:17 and I was overjoyed as the two Gospels, Matthew and John,
00:03:20 were released in German Sign Language.
00:03:24 I had searched long for answers,
00:03:26 and now Jehovah has given me this wonderful gift.
00:03:30 I can hardly wait to use the Bible in the field ministry
00:03:34 and to show other deaf ones God’s Word,
00:03:37 not as text, but signed in their language.
