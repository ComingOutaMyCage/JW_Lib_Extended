Moses’ parents taught him
when he was a child.

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned to love Jehovah
and how to make Him smile.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when my parents teach me,
I’ll listen when they speak.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll listen just like Moses—
’cause I want to be meek.

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
He let Jehovah train him
while he was herding sheep.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned how to be patient
and how to be meek.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’ll obey Jehovah
and listen when he speaks.

00:00:55.743 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll listen just like Moses—
’cause I want to be meek.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:09.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was the chosen leader
of the Israelites.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he would also listen
when others gave advice.

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:21.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’ll let my friends help me
and listen when they speak.

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:28.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll listen just like Moses—
’cause I want to be meek.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:46.835 line:90% position:50% align:center

and listen when he speaks.

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:53.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll listen just like Moses—
’cause I want to be meek.
