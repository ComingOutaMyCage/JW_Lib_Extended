00:00:12 Moses’ parents taught him when he was a child.
00:00:18 He learned to love Jehovah and how to make Him smile.
00:00:24 So when my parents teach me, I’ll listen when they speak.
00:00:30 I’ll listen just like Moses— ’cause I want to be meek.
00:00:38 He let Jehovah train him while he was herding sheep.
00:00:44 He learned how to be patient and how to be meek.
00:00:49 So I’ll obey Jehovah and listen when he speaks.
00:00:55 I’ll listen just like Moses— ’cause I want to be meek.
00:01:03 He was the chosen leader of the Israelites.
00:01:09 But he would also listen when others gave advice.
00:01:15 So I’ll let my friends help me and listen when they speak.
00:01:21 I’ll listen just like Moses— ’cause I want to be meek.
00:01:40 So I’ll obey Jehovah and listen when he speaks.
00:01:46 I’ll listen just like Moses— ’cause I want to be meek.
