00:00:14 Jehovah our God, exalted in might,
00:00:24 Creator of life and Provider of light.
00:00:35 Creation speaks of your power so grand;
00:00:46 The heavens and earth forever stand.
00:00:59 Your heavenly throne, on justice it stands.
00:01:10 To us you make known all your righteous commands.
00:01:20 And as we turn to your Word, we can see
00:01:31 Your wisdom revealed so brilliantly.
00:01:50 The greatest of all is your perfect love.
00:02:00 Beyond all compare are your gifts from above.
00:02:11 Your attributes and your glorious name,
00:02:22 With joy and with zeal, we will proclaim.
