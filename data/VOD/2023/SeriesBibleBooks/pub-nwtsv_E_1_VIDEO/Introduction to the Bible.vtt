00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:04.441 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to the Bible.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is a collection
of ancient writings, or books,

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
that contain God’s message for all people.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
This message was put down in writing

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
by approximately 40 different men.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
using Hebrew letters and Greek letters.

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
The writers came
from many different backgrounds

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:35.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lived in various places
throughout the ancient Near East

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and southern Europe.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:39.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet everything in the Bible harmonizes

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:42.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
—there are no contradictions.

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
By various means,
God put his thoughts

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the minds of these writers.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why the Bible says
that “all Scripture is inspired of God.”

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.579 line:10% position:50% align:center
Bible writing began in 1513 B.C.E.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.333 line:10% position:50% align:center
It continued for the next 1,600 years.

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.085 line:10% position:50% align:center
The last books of the Bible to be written

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.546 line:10% position:50% align:center
were completed about 98 C.E.

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible’s 66 books

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
are grouped into two main sections:

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:15.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:17.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
often called the Old Testament,

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:19.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
commonly called the New Testament.

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:28.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Hebrew Scriptures
make up the first 39 books of the Bible.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pentateuch, or first five books,

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:34.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
describe the creation of all things

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the founding
of the ancient nation of Israel.

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
The historical books show how,

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:44.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the nation of Israel
enters the Promised Land,

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel is unfaithful to God

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:50.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is taken into exile
but eventually returns to its homeland.

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:54.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
The poetic books feature sacred songs

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and practical wisdom for daily living.

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:01.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophetic books foretell future events

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and contain instructions
and warnings for God’s people.

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:10.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last 27 books of the Bible
make up the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:14.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, there are the four Gospels

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a history of Jesus’
earthly life and ministry.

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:20.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Acts of Apostles

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
narrates the history
of the early Christian congregation.

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:28.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are 21 letters
that contain practical counsel

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:30.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encouragement for Christians.

00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last book, Revelation,

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
contains a series of prophetic visions.

00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:44.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible,
God identifies himself as the Creator,

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
outlines his purpose,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reveals his personal name, Jehovah

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:52.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
—shown here in ancient Hebrew lettering.

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:57.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike any other book,

00:02:57.156 --> 00:03:01.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible magnifies God’s name, Jehovah.

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
It mentions his name over 7,000 times,

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than any other name.

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:10.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s purpose
is for all intelligent creatures

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:13.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live forever under his rulership.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.675 line:10% position:50% align:center
But early in human history,

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:19.595 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s sovereignty, or right to rule,

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:21.096 line:10% position:50% align:center
was challenged

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:24.349 line:10% position:50% align:center
by a rebellious spirit creature called Satan,

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.351 line:10% position:50% align:center
who spoke by means of a snake.

00:03:27.686 --> 00:03:30.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
How Jehovah will clear his name

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restore his rulership
by means of his Kingdom

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:35.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the theme of the Bible.

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:38.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer Satan’s accusations,

00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:42.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah allows humans
to pursue their own course.

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Centuries of disastrous human rule follow.

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:50.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Jehovah arranges
to accomplish his purpose

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:53.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of a Savior
—the Messiah—

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:56.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will eventually become
King of God’s Kingdom.

00:03:57.382 --> 00:04:00.052 line:10% position:50% align:center
In time, Jehovah reveals

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:02.054 line:10% position:50% align:center
who this Messiah will be.

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.724 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus, a spirit son of God,

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:08.644 line:10% position:50% align:center
is miraculously born as a human.

00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:11.063 line:10% position:50% align:center
He teaches people about Jehovah

00:04:11.063 --> 00:04:14.817 line:10% position:50% align:center
and sacrifices his life to save mankind.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:16.819 line:10% position:50% align:center
God then resurrects Jesus

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.821 line:10% position:50% align:center
back to heavenly life.

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:22.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that Jesus rids the heavens

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all those
who do not support God’s sovereignty.

00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:28.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
As King of God’s Kingdom,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is joined by 144,000 corulers,

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who have been bought from the earth.”

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom
will restore the earth to ideal conditions.

00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:43.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s purpose will be fulfilled:

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:48.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
All faithful intelligent creatures
will unitedly worship him forever

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:50.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
as their one true God and Sovereign.

00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:55.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read and study the Bible,

00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:58.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
note its internal harmony
and practical wisdom

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:03.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as how each book
contributes to its overall theme:

00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:06.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
the vindication of Jehovah’s name,

00:05:06.118 --> 00:05:09.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will be accomplished
by means of his heavenly Kingdom

00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:13.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the hands
of his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ.
