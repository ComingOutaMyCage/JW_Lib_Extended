00:00:02 An introduction to the Bible.
00:00:06 The Bible is a collection of ancient writings, or books,
00:00:10 that contain God’s message for all people.
00:00:14 This message was put down in writing
00:00:16 by approximately 40 different men.
00:00:19 It was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek
00:00:23 using Hebrew letters and Greek letters.
00:00:27 The writers came from many different backgrounds
00:00:31 and lived in various places throughout the ancient Near East
00:00:35 and southern Europe.
00:00:36 Yet everything in the Bible harmonizes
00:00:39 —there are no contradictions.
00:00:43 By various means, God put his thoughts
00:00:46 into the minds of these writers.
00:00:48 That is why the Bible says that “all Scripture is inspired of God.”
00:00:54 Bible writing began in 1513 B.C.E.
00:00:58 It continued for the next 1,600 years.
00:01:03 The last books of the Bible to be written
00:01:05 were completed about 98 C.E.
00:01:09 The Bible’s 66 books
00:01:11 are grouped into two main sections:
00:01:13 the Hebrew Scriptures,
00:01:15 often called the Old Testament,
00:01:17 and the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:01:19 commonly called the New Testament.
00:01:24 The Hebrew Scriptures make up the first 39 books of the Bible.
00:01:29 The Pentateuch, or first five books,
00:01:31 describe the creation of all things
00:01:34 and the founding of the ancient nation of Israel.
00:01:38 The historical books show how,
00:01:40 after the nation of Israel enters the Promised Land,
00:01:44 Israel is unfaithful to God
00:01:46 and is taken into exile but eventually returns to its homeland.
00:01:52 The poetic books feature sacred songs
00:01:54 and practical wisdom for daily living.
00:01:58 The prophetic books foretell future events
00:02:01 and contain instructions and warnings for God’s people.
00:02:05 The last 27 books of the Bible make up the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:02:11 First, there are the four Gospels
00:02:14 —a history of Jesus’ earthly life and ministry.
00:02:18 Then Acts of Apostles
00:02:20 narrates the history of the early Christian congregation.
00:02:25 There are 21 letters that contain practical counsel
00:02:28 and encouragement for Christians.
00:02:31 The last book, Revelation,
00:02:34 contains a series of prophetic visions.
00:02:40 In the Bible, God identifies himself as the Creator,
00:02:44 outlines his purpose,
00:02:46 and reveals his personal name, Jehovah
00:02:50 —shown here in ancient Hebrew lettering.
00:02:52 Did you know?
00:02:54 Unlike any other book,
00:02:57 the Bible magnifies God’s name, Jehovah.
00:03:01 It mentions his name over 7,000 times,
00:03:04 more than any other name.
00:03:08 Jehovah’s purpose is for all intelligent creatures
00:03:10 to live forever under his rulership.
00:03:14 But early in human history,
00:03:16 Jehovah’s sovereignty, or right to rule,
00:03:19 was challenged
00:03:21 by a rebellious spirit creature called Satan,
00:03:24 who spoke by means of a snake.
00:03:27 How Jehovah will clear his name
00:03:30 and restore his rulership by means of his Kingdom
00:03:33 is the theme of the Bible.
00:03:36 To answer Satan’s accusations,
00:03:38 Jehovah allows humans to pursue their own course.
00:03:42 Centuries of disastrous human rule follow.
00:03:46 Meanwhile, Jehovah arranges to accomplish his purpose
00:03:50 by means of a Savior —the Messiah—
00:03:53 who will eventually become King of God’s Kingdom.
00:03:57 In time, Jehovah reveals
00:04:00 who this Messiah will be.
00:04:02 Jesus, a spirit son of God,
00:04:05 is miraculously born as a human.
00:04:08 He teaches people about Jehovah
00:04:11 and sacrifices his life to save mankind.
00:04:14 God then resurrects Jesus
00:04:16 back to heavenly life.
00:04:19 The Bible says that Jesus rids the heavens
00:04:22 of all those who do not support God’s sovereignty.
00:04:26 As King of God’s Kingdom,
00:04:28 Jesus is joined by 144,000 corulers,
00:04:32 “who have been bought from the earth.”
00:04:35 God’s Kingdom will restore the earth to ideal conditions.
00:04:39 Jehovah’s purpose will be fulfilled:
00:04:43 All faithful intelligent creatures will unitedly worship him forever
00:04:48 as their one true God and Sovereign.
00:04:52 As you read and study the Bible,
00:04:55 note its internal harmony and practical wisdom
00:04:58 as well as how each book contributes to its overall theme:
00:05:03 the vindication of Jehovah’s name,
00:05:06 which will be accomplished by means of his heavenly Kingdom
00:05:09 in the hands of his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ.
