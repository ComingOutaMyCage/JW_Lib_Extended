00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.652 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to 2 Chronicles.

00:00:06.862 --> 00:00:10.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
First and Second Chronicles
were originally one volume,

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:12.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was later divided into two.

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
The writer was Ezra,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
an Aaronic priest and copyist,

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.296 line:10% position:50% align:center
who completed the volume about 460 B.C.E.

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:25.926 line:10% position:50% align:center
The writing deals almost entirely

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.928 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the kingdom of Judah.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.514 line:10% position:50% align:center
Second Chronicles covers

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:32.725 line:10% position:50% align:center
a period of 500 years,

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:34.811 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the start of Solomon’s reign

00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:37.356 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1037 B.C.E.

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:39.358 line:10% position:50% align:center
to Persian King Cyrus’ decree

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:41.569 line:10% position:50% align:center
of 537 B.C.E.

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:43.446 line:10% position:50% align:center
to rebuild the house of Jehovah

00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:44.864 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Jerusalem.

00:00:48.118 --> 00:00:51.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 1 to 9 discuss
the reign of King Solomon.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 1,

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:57.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives Solomon extraordinary wisdom

00:00:57.462 --> 00:00:59.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he can judge the people well.

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 2 to 7 cover

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:05.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon’s preparations for the temple

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:07.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
—its utensils and furnishings

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:11.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as its construction and inauguration.

00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:14.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 9,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
the queen of Sheba visits Solomon

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is amazed at his wisdom.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Solomon’s 40-year reign,

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:24.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
his son Rehoboam becomes king.

00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:27.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the next chapter,

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:30.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
ten tribes revolt against Rehoboam

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:32.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
and form the northern kingdom of Israel.

00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:37.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 17 to 20 discuss King Jehoshaphat,

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:40.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
who does what is right in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:44.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even sends out princes and Levites
to teach God’s Law.

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:47.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 20,

00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:50.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat prays for help
when facing the combined forces

00:01:50.983 --> 00:01:53.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Ammon, Moab,

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:55.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the mountainous region of Seir.

00:01:56.698 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
In answer to the king’s prayer,

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
God causes the invaders
to slaughter each other.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 22,

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:09.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
wicked Queen Athaliah destroys
the “royal line of the house of Judah”

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:12.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
except for the child Jehoash.

00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:15.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is saved by Jehoshabeath

00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:18.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and her husband, High Priest Jehoiada.

00:02:19.183 --> 00:02:21.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapters 23 and 24,

00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:24.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoash is made king at age seven

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:26.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Athaliah is put to death.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the good influence
of High Priest Jehoiada,

00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:34.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoash does what is right in God’s eyes,

00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:36.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
even renovating the temple.

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after Jehoiada dies,

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoash abandons true worship.

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehoiada’s son rebukes the king,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoash has him put to death.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:51.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 26,

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uzziah becomes king.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first,
he does what is right in God’s eyes,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
but later he becomes haughty.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even tries to burn incense in the temple

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:05.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a responsibility reserved for the priests.

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:09.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah strikes Uzziah with leprosy.

00:03:10.701 --> 00:03:12.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 29 to 32 discuss

00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:15.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
the reign of King Hezekiah,

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
who zealously promotes true worship

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:19.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
all his life.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
During Hezekiah’s reign,

00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:24.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Assyrian King Sennacherib invades Judah

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:26.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and threatens Jerusalem.

00:03:27.096 --> 00:03:29.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s angel wipes out

00:03:29.432 --> 00:03:33.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“every mighty warrior, leader, and chief”
in the Assyrian camp.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapter 33

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
discusses the 55-year reign of King Manasseh,

00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:43.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
who does “on a grand scale
what [is] bad in Jehovah’s eyes.”

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although King Manasseh later repented,

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:56.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
his depravity sent Judah
into the moral and spiritual tailspin

00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:58.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led to its exile.

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:03.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 34 and 35 discuss the reign

00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:05.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
of King Josiah.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:07.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eight years old when he becomes king,

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:10.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
he remains firm for true worship.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:16.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even embarks
on a sweeping campaign against idolatry.

00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:22.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapter 36 discusses
the last four kings of Judah

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:23.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehoahaz,

00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:24.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoiakim,

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:25.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoiachin,

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:27.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Zedekiah.

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:29.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
All disobey Jehovah.

00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:33.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the earlier efforts
of the good kings,

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:37.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judah continues to decline into apostasy.

00:04:37.636 --> 00:04:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah allows the Babylonians

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:42.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
to invade the land and attack Jerusalem.

00:04:43.727 --> 00:04:45.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
They destroy the city

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take the people into exile.

00:04:49.108 --> 00:04:51.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra concludes 2 Chronicles

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
by leaping ahead 70 years

00:04:53.113 --> 00:04:55.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the reign of Persian King Cyrus.

00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a historic decree,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cyrus frees the Jews,

00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:03.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
telling them to rebuild the house of Jehovah
in Jerusalem.

00:05:05.586 --> 00:05:08.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read 2 Chronicles,

00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
learn from the examples of the kings

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:12.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
(good and bad),

00:05:12.677 --> 00:05:15.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
see how Jehovah blessed those who loved him,

00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:17.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note how he preserved

00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:19.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
the royal line of David,

00:05:19.393 --> 00:05:21.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
which later produced the Messiah,

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
the King of God’s Kingdom.
