WEBVTT

00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:03.274 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, we have a table announcement

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:04.943 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the Publishing Committee

00:00:04.943 --> 00:00:07.237 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we’d like to share with you also.

00:00:07.237 --> 00:00:09.030 line:10% position:50% align:center
It says: “We’re pleased to inform you

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of a milestone with the Ramapo project.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:14.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On December 28, 2022,

00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:18.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Town Board of Ramapo
made an important decision

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:21.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in favor of the new project at Ramapo.

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:25.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One aspect of the decision
will allow our buildings to be higher

00:00:25.173 --> 00:00:29.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“than the town’s
maximum-allowed building height of 45 feet,

00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or about 14 meters.

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:35.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Some of the buildings for our project
need to have a height of 75 feet,

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:37.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or about 23 meters.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:42.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Another aspect of the decision
allows us to begin clearing the necessary trees

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to prepare for site works and construction.

00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:48.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, why is that significant?

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:50.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Typically, authorities in Ramapo

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:54.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“only allow tree clearing
after construction approval is given.

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:57.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We do not expect
to receive construction approval

00:00:57.668 --> 00:00:59.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until later this year.

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:03.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The legally permitted season
to cut down trees ends in March.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That means without this approval,

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:09.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we would have to wait until November 2023

00:01:09.264 --> 00:01:11.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we could begin construction activities.”

00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:15.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the experience like
for our brothers who have been working hard

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
to obtain the permits for the project?

00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:21.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has been the reaction
of members of the Ramapo Town Board

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other professionals
we have worked with?

00:01:24.698 --> 00:01:26.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch the following video.

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:41.300 line:10% position:50% align:center
This is a huge project.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s 1.7 million square feet.

00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:45.888 line:10% position:50% align:center
It is easily the biggest project

00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the town of Ramapo has ever seen.

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:51.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s probably the biggest project
that we’ve seen in Rockland County.

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:54.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s enormously complex.

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:57.401 line:10% position:50% align:center
To get an EIS all the way through the process

00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:00.071 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 18 months would be incredibly aggressive

00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:02.949 line:10% position:50% align:center
and is very rare that a project is able to hit that.

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:05.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, I’ve seen some projects
that go for ten years,

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is not ideal, clearly.

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:09.206 line:10% position:50% align:center
So the outcome of the meeting

00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:11.125 line:10% position:50% align:center
was that there was a very positive discussion.

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:12.710 line:10% position:50% align:center
There was no one who spoke up

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.337 line:10% position:50% align:center
in opposition to our project.

00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:16.339 line:10% position:50% align:center
The town supervisor just recommended

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.466 line:10% position:50% align:center
that they postpone the decision

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:19.884 line:10% position:50% align:center
for another two weeks.

00:02:19.884 --> 00:02:21.303 line:10% position:50% align:center
I think it’s like anything else;

00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:22.721 line:10% position:50% align:center
it can get frustrating.

00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:25.641 line:10% position:50% align:center
But I also think it’s the best we can do, right?

00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:26.517 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re beating the arrows

00:02:26.517 --> 00:02:29.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
as hard as we can on the ground,
and it’s in Jehovah’s hands.

00:02:34.484 --> 00:02:37.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had some disappointing things
up to this point,

00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:40.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I feel like we’ve been stronger for it.

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:41.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve tried to get a little closer.

00:02:41.742 --> 00:02:43.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the expectation—

00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:46.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture in Proverbs 13 talks about how

00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:49.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘expectation of your heart
can almost make you sick.’

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:53.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have felt some pressure,
and tonight was just a complete relief.

00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:56.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got together, and we prayed

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all the other brothers
that have been working so hard on this project.

00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:04.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we sat in that room, and we just relaxed,
and we let Jehovah handle the rest.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
So tonight the Town Board of Ramapo

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
voted on four different actions.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those actions basically changed the law

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enable our project to move ahead.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
They changed something called

00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:23.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Comprehensive Plan
of the Town of Ramapo.

00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:28.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also enabled
a special permit application

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:30.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go forward.

00:03:30.713 --> 00:03:35.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they also scheduled
a public hearing later in December,

00:03:35.093 --> 00:03:39.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
which basically enables some other things
about our project to move forward,

00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:43.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as potentially the removal of trees.

00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:46.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think, you know,
this was a major milestone tonight,

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think everybody
should be really excited

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:51.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this really allows the project
to move forward

00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:53.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way that was envisioned
from the beginning.

00:03:53.948 --> 00:03:55.408 line:10% position:50% align:center
We certainly went in

00:03:55.408 --> 00:03:56.909 line:10% position:50% align:center
with questions and concerns

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.495 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we wanted addressed,

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:01.956 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the satisfying part is,

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:04.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
from my point of view at least,
those questions and concerns

00:04:04.668 --> 00:04:08.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
were all met (and properly)
and more than adequately addressed.

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:10.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
My feeling on the project

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:14.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
went from skeptical and objective

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:16.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and I’m still always trying to be objective)

00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:20.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
to seeing the positive nature
of what was proposed

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we could approve this
in its final form

00:04:25.524 --> 00:04:27.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a way that would be a positive thing

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:30.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a credit for the town and for Watchtower.

00:04:30.822 --> 00:04:32.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really a pleasure working with Watchtower

00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:35.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
—always friendly
and always very knowledgeable

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:38.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what you’re going after,
what your programming is,

00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:39.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
the type of project that you want to do

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:44.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, really, a lot of dedication
to the site itself and the environment.

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:48.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
I drive past the Patterson site all the time,

00:04:48.592 --> 00:04:51.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s gorgeous,
and you really maintain your properties.

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:53.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a pleasure working with you,

00:04:53.055 --> 00:04:56.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re really valued
by the communities that you’re in.

00:04:56.184 --> 00:04:57.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
All those folks who have been working on it

00:04:57.727 --> 00:04:59.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be very proud
of the work that they’ve done.

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve done a great job.

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:03.400 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everyone has been very honest and forthcoming

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.194 line:10% position:50% align:center
with their intentions

00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:07.571 line:10% position:50% align:center
of what they plan to bring here.

00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:10.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are now going to be our neighbors,

00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:13.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
and welcome to the neighborhood.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very excited that you chose our town
for this very important site for you,

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:22.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so far it’s been
a great experience working with you,

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we look to continue that relationship.

00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:27.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel relieved.

00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:31.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel relieved that after what’s been
almost three years

00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:34.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
of work with the town

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:39.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to go through this process to make sure
that every box was ticked

00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:42.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every issue addressed—

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s finally done.

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s produced what our organization needs,

00:05:47.908 --> 00:05:51.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s done it in a way
that the community is satisfied.

00:05:51.954 --> 00:05:56.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we saw that tonight by the fact
that there was not one single person

00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:59.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking out in opposition to the project.

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:03.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
No comments were made
that were detrimental

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:05.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what we’ve proposed and planned,

00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:08.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
so it was a very easy project

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the town board members
to embrace and to approve

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:15.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they weren’t dealing
with any political opposition.

00:06:32.082 --> 00:06:34.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Psalm 4:3 states:

00:06:34.084 --> 00:06:38.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Know that Jehovah
will treat his loyal one in a special way.’

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Time and again,
we are seeing evidence

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of Jehovah treating us ‘in a special way’

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by moving this project
over one hurdle after another.

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:48.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All praise goes to him.

00:06:48.726 --> 00:06:52.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We still have a long way to go
and many obstacles to overcome.

00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:56.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But we are confident
that Jehovah will continue to open the way.

00:06:56.151 --> 00:07:00.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll keep the brotherhood updated
as this exciting project develops.”
