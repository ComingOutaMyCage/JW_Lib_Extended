00:00:01 Well, we have a table announcement
00:00:03 from the Publishing Committee
00:00:04 that we’d like to share with you also.
00:00:07 It says: “We’re pleased to inform you
00:00:09 “of a milestone with the Ramapo project.
00:00:12 “On December 28, 2022,
00:00:14 “the Town Board of Ramapo made an important decision
00:00:18 “in favor of the new project at Ramapo.
00:00:21 “One aspect of the decision will allow our buildings to be higher
00:00:25 “than the town’s maximum-allowed building height of 45 feet,
00:00:29 “or about 14 meters.
00:00:31 “Some of the buildings for our project need to have a height of 75 feet,
00:00:35 “or about 23 meters.
00:00:37 “Another aspect of the decision allows us to begin clearing the necessary trees
00:00:42 “to prepare for site works and construction.
00:00:45 “Now, why is that significant?
00:00:48 “Typically, authorities in Ramapo
00:00:50 “only allow tree clearing after construction approval is given.
00:00:54 “We do not expect to receive construction approval
00:00:57 “until later this year.
00:00:59 “The legally permitted season to cut down trees ends in March.
00:01:03 “That means without this approval,
00:01:05 “we would have to wait until November 2023
00:01:09 before we could begin construction activities.”
00:01:12 What was the experience like for our brothers who have been working hard
00:01:15 to obtain the permits for the project?
00:01:18 What has been the reaction of members of the Ramapo Town Board
00:01:21 and other professionals we have worked with?
00:01:24 Let’s watch the following video.
00:01:39 This is a huge project.
00:01:41 It’s 1.7 million square feet.
00:01:43 It is easily the biggest project
00:01:45 that the town of Ramapo has ever seen.
00:01:48 It’s probably the biggest project that we’ve seen in Rockland County.
00:01:51 It’s enormously complex.
00:01:54 To get an EIS all the way through the process
00:01:57 in 18 months would be incredibly aggressive
00:02:00 and is very rare that a project is able to hit that.
00:02:02 I mean, I’ve seen some projects that go for ten years,
00:02:05 which is not ideal, clearly.
00:02:07 So the outcome of the meeting
00:02:09 was that there was a very positive discussion.
00:02:11 There was no one who spoke up
00:02:12 in opposition to our project.
00:02:14 The town supervisor just recommended
00:02:16 that they postpone the decision
00:02:18 for another two weeks.
00:02:19 I think it’s like anything else;
00:02:21 it can get frustrating.
00:02:22 But I also think it’s the best we can do, right?
00:02:25 We’re beating the arrows
00:02:26 as hard as we can on the ground, and it’s in Jehovah’s hands.
00:02:34 We’ve had some disappointing things up to this point,
00:02:37 and I feel like we’ve been stronger for it.
00:02:40 We’ve tried to get a little closer.
00:02:41 And the expectation—
00:02:43 The scripture in Proverbs 13 talks about how
00:02:46 ‘expectation of your heart can almost make you sick.’
00:02:49 We have felt some pressure, and tonight was just a complete relief.
00:02:53 We got together, and we prayed
00:02:56 with all the other brothers that have been working so hard on this project.
00:03:00 Then we sat in that room, and we just relaxed, and we let Jehovah handle the rest.
00:03:04 So tonight the Town Board of Ramapo
00:03:07 voted on four different actions.
00:03:11 Those actions basically changed the law
00:03:14 to enable our project to move ahead.
00:03:17 They changed something called
00:03:19 the Comprehensive Plan of the Town of Ramapo.
00:03:24 They also enabled a special permit application
00:03:28 to go forward.
00:03:30 And then they also scheduled a public hearing later in December,
00:03:35 which basically enables some other things about our project to move forward,
00:03:39 such as potentially the removal of trees.
00:03:43 I think, you know, this was a major milestone tonight,
00:03:46 and I think everybody should be really excited
00:03:48 that this really allows the project to move forward
00:03:51 in the way that was envisioned from the beginning.
00:03:53 We certainly went in
00:03:55 with questions and concerns
00:03:56 that we wanted addressed,
00:03:59 and the satisfying part is,
00:04:01 from my point of view at least, those questions and concerns
00:04:04 were all met (and properly) and more than adequately addressed.
00:04:08 My feeling on the project
00:04:10 went from skeptical and objective
00:04:14 (and I’m still always trying to be objective)
00:04:16 to seeing the positive nature of what was proposed
00:04:20 and how we could approve this in its final form
00:04:25 in a way that would be a positive thing
00:04:27 and a credit for the town and for Watchtower.
00:04:30 It’s really a pleasure working with Watchtower
00:04:32 —always friendly and always very knowledgeable
00:04:35 about what you’re going after, what your programming is,
00:04:38 the type of project that you want to do
00:04:39 and, really, a lot of dedication to the site itself and the environment.
00:04:46 I drive past the Patterson site all the time,
00:04:48 and it’s gorgeous, and you really maintain your properties.
00:04:51 It’s a pleasure working with you,
00:04:53 and you’re really valued by the communities that you’re in.
00:04:56 All those folks who have been working on it
00:04:57 should be very proud of the work that they’ve done.
00:04:59 They’ve done a great job.
00:05:00 Everyone has been very honest and forthcoming
00:05:03 with their intentions
00:05:05 of what they plan to bring here.
00:05:07 You are now going to be our neighbors,
00:05:10 and welcome to the neighborhood.
00:05:13 We’re very excited that you chose our town for this very important site for you,
00:05:18 and so far it’s been a great experience working with you,
00:05:22 and we look to continue that relationship.
00:05:25 I feel relieved.
00:05:27 I feel relieved that after what’s been almost three years
00:05:31 of work with the town
00:05:34 —to go through this process to make sure that every box was ticked
00:05:39 and every issue addressed—
00:05:42 it’s finally done.
00:05:44 And it’s produced what our organization needs,
00:05:47 and it’s done it in a way that the community is satisfied.
00:05:51 And we saw that tonight by the fact that there was not one single person
00:05:56 speaking out in opposition to the project.
00:05:59 No comments were made that were detrimental
00:06:03 to what we’ve proposed and planned,
00:06:05 so it was a very easy project
00:06:08 for the town board members to embrace and to approve
00:06:11 because they weren’t dealing with any political opposition.
00:06:32 “Psalm 4:3 states:
00:06:34 “‘Know that Jehovah will treat his loyal one in a special way.’
00:06:38 “Time and again, we are seeing evidence
00:06:40 “of Jehovah treating us ‘in a special way’
00:06:42 “by moving this project over one hurdle after another.
00:06:46 “All praise goes to him.
00:06:48 “We still have a long way to go and many obstacles to overcome.
00:06:52 “But we are confident that Jehovah will continue to open the way.
00:06:56 We’ll keep the brotherhood updated as this exciting project develops.”
