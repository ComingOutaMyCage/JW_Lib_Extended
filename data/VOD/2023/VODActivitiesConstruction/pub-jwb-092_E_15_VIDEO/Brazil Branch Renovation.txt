00:00:05 Welcome to the Brazil branch!
00:00:07 Today we will show you the work
00:00:09 that’s being carried out
00:00:11 in the renovation of this beautiful branch.
00:00:15 Our buildings house more than 1,150 Bethelites
00:00:18 and also provide work space
00:00:21 for an additional 600 commuters.
00:00:24 The last branch expansion finished in 1997,
00:00:27 and since then, there has not been a renovation of its buildings.
00:00:31 In addition, the way in which much of the work is done here
00:00:35 has changed a lot.
00:00:37 During this period,
00:00:39 the number of publishers in Brazil
00:00:41 has almost doubled,
00:00:43 reaching to more than 900,000.
00:00:45 Although our buildings are very well cared for,
00:00:49 some mechanical, electrical, and computer systems are outdated,
00:00:53 which limits their usefulness.
00:00:56 For these and other reasons,
00:00:59 the renovation is necessary for Bethel to continue caring
00:01:04 for the present and future needs of the organization.
00:01:12 The renovation has already started.
00:01:15 Temporary accommodations have been created
00:01:17 for more than 220 volunteers.
00:01:20 These accommodations will be used by the construction team.
00:01:33 This is a renovated apartment.
00:01:36 Along with new finishes, the mechanical and electrical systems have been replaced.
00:01:41 The new windows have better thermal and acoustic insulation,
00:01:45 letting in more natural light and serving to economize resources.
00:01:50 Each of the over 650 apartments at the branch will be renovated.
00:01:55 While on the subject of economizing and simplifying,
00:01:58 now each Bethelite will wash their own clothes.
00:02:01 Twenty-nine new laundry rooms are being constructed
00:02:04 throughout the residential blocks.
00:02:07 In addition, practically all of the offices
00:02:10 will be completely renovated and modernized.
00:02:13 We currently have office space for approximately 500 workers.
00:02:17 The renovation will create room for almost 900.
00:02:22 The new layout will also provide the option to reconfigure the office space
00:02:27 to more than 1,050 workstations.
00:02:33 Also, the project includes plans to renovate and modernize
00:02:37 most of the public areas throughout the branch,
00:02:40 creating a nicer environment to work and live.
00:02:54 In order to accomplish this, we plan to have
00:02:57 between 350 and 400 workers per day at the renovation.
00:03:02 I am 23 years old.
00:03:03 I’ve always had the dream of serving in construction.
00:03:07 Then I had the privilege of being called to serve in the construction
00:03:10 going on here at Bethel.
00:03:11 It’s amazing.
00:03:12 I work on the electrical crew.
00:03:14 I took an electrical course when I was 15,
00:03:17 but the truth is, I really learned this profession here in Bethel.
00:03:22 This is my wife, Nathalia.
00:03:24 And this is my husband, José.
00:03:26 And this is our first assignment together.
00:03:28 I’m serving in the Engineering Department in the design sector.
00:03:32 I’m in masonry, something I’ve never done before.
00:03:35 At the end of the day when I finish work,
00:03:38 I feel like I’ve really accomplished something.
00:03:43 We hope that at the end of this project,
00:03:48 these buildings will become a place that’s even more efficient
00:03:51 and better prepared to care for the future needs.
00:04:28 Would you like to have a part in this project?
00:04:33 If so, know that your prayers
00:04:35 and your contributions to the worldwide work
00:04:38 are a great help.
00:04:40 Also, if your circumstances permit,
00:04:43 then why not make yourself available to come
00:04:46 and serve as a volunteer on this or another construction project?
