00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to the Brazil branch!

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:09.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today we will show you the work

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s being carried out

00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the renovation of this beautiful branch.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our buildings house
more than 1,150 Bethelites

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also provide work space

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an additional 600 commuters.

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last branch expansion finished in 1997,

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:31.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
and since then, there has not been
a renovation of its buildings.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, the way in which
much of the work is done here

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:37.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
has changed a lot.

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:39.101 line:10% position:50% align:center
During this period,

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.186 line:10% position:50% align:center
the number of publishers in Brazil

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:43.230 line:10% position:50% align:center
has almost doubled,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.983 line:10% position:50% align:center
reaching to more than 900,000.

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:49.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although our buildings
are very well cared for,

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:53.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
some mechanical, electrical,
and computer systems are outdated,

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
which limits their usefulness.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
For these and other reasons,

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
the renovation is necessary
for Bethel to continue caring

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the present and future needs
of the organization.

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:15.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
The renovation has already started.

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:17.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Temporary accommodations have been created

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
for more than 220 volunteers.

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:24.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
These accommodations will be used
by the construction team.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a renovated apartment.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with new finishes, the mechanical
and electrical systems have been replaced.

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:45.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new windows have
better thermal and acoustic insulation,

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:49.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
letting in more natural light
and serving to economize resources.

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each of the over 650 apartments at the branch
will be renovated.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:58.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
While on the subject of economizing
and simplifying,

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:01.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
now each Bethelite
will wash their own clothes.

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:04.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty-nine new laundry rooms
are being constructed

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the residential blocks.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, practically all of the offices

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:13.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be completely renovated and modernized.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:17.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
We currently have office space
for approximately 500 workers.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
The renovation will create room
for almost 900.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new layout will also provide the option
to reconfigure the office space

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:30.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
to more than 1,050 workstations.

00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:37.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, the project includes plans
to renovate and modernize

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:40.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of the public areas
throughout the branch,

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:44.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
creating a nicer environment
to work and live.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to accomplish this, we plan to have

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
between 350 and 400 workers per day
at the renovation.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am 23 years old.

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:07.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve always had the dream
of serving in construction.

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:10.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I had the privilege of being called
to serve in the construction

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:11.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
going on here at Bethel.

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing.

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
I work on the electrical crew.

00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:17.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
I took an electrical course when I was 15,

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:22.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the truth is, I really learned
this profession here in Bethel.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:24.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my wife, Nathalia.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is my husband, José.

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:28.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is our first assignment together.

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:32.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m serving in the Engineering Department
in the design sector.

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:35.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m in masonry,
something I’ve never done before.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:38.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the day when I finish work,

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like I’ve really
accomplished something.

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:48.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope that at the end of this project,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
these buildings will become a place
that’s even more efficient

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:54.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and better prepared
to care for the future needs.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to have a part
in this project?

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:35.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, know that your prayers

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:38.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your contributions to the worldwide work

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
are a great help.

00:04:40.717 --> 00:04:43.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, if your circumstances permit,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
then why not make yourself available to come

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve as a volunteer
on this or another construction project?
