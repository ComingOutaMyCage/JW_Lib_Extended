Hi, I am Michalis,
and this is <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.”</i>

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.248 line:10% position:50% align:center
One challenge that often makes me nervous

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.584 line:10% position:50% align:center
is when I’ve prepared an introduction

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:23.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ve planned the conversation

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:27.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the householder doesn’t follow the plan

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:29.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have to adapt.

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever had that experience?

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:36.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
This could mean
that what we prepared just won’t work.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we are going to discuss four tips

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:43.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have helped me and hopefully

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help you be more adaptable.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
The four tips are

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) know your territory,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) make use of the Teaching Toolbox,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) anticipate

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
common objections or questions,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (4) be flexible

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adjust to the householder’s needs,

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:15.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
because remember,
this is meant to be a conversation,

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
not a sermon or a sales pitch.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s look at a situation

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:26.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
where applying
these four suggestions can help.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:34.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what introduction are you using?

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:37.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought I would talk
about economic problems.

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm.
Good idea!

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:39.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really suits the territory.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:41.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll read Isaiah 65:21-23
and then offer the <i>Kingdom</i>  tract.

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:47.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perfect.

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:48.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll get the scripture ready.

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:07.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people in our area
struggle to make ends meet.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think there will ever be a time

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we won’t have to stress about money?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, now isn’t a good time.

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just received some bad news.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll come back another time then.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:29.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister applied
our first two tips really well.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:37.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our sisters are usually excellent
when it comes to the ministry

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
so no real surprises there.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice?

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, she knew her territory well

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:50.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had a presentation
designed specifically for it.

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, her scripture and talking point

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:58.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
were taken from the tract
<i>What Is the Kingdom of God?,</i>

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:02.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
which, as you know,
is part of our Teaching Toolbox.

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:07.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when the householder
had something else on her mind,

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:10.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
our sister opted to return later.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
That could be a good decision
in this kind of situation,

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:17.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
but let’s see what would happen

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
if she were to ask just one more question

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adapt according
to the householder’s response.

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, now isn’t a good time.

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:32.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just received some bad news.

00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:34.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:36.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:38.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
I, uh, I- I just heard
that my sister has cancer.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:47.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, that must be so difficult

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:48.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your sister

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:50.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for you!

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:54.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, when someone we love is suffering,
we can often feel helpless.

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:56.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s exactly how I feel.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have a moment,

00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
could I show you something
that I find comforting

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:04.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a time in the near future
when our loved ones will never suffer again?

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:06.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I’d like that.

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:08.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what the Bible says

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:12.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Revelation 21:3, 4:

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that I heard a loud voice
from the throne say . . .”

00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:21.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how she was able
to offer this woman real comfort

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:28.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
just by being adaptable?

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:32.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
All it took was one simple question,

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:40.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was sincere and friendly,
and the householder responded.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point,
our sister applied our third tip.

00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:48.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
She obviously was familiar
with some common anxieties

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
of ones in that territory

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she smoothly transitioned

00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:57.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the topic of suffering,
which allowed her to listen

00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the householder’s real concern

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then implement our fourth tip.

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:07.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
She adjusted to meet those needs.

00:05:07.953 --> 00:05:11.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Plus, she didn’t struggle
to find information to use.

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:15.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
She stayed right there
in her Teaching Toolbox.

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:20.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Granted, not every situation
will be as straightforward as this,

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:23.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it takes time and experience

00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:26.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get comfortable moving
from one topic to another.

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:29.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we apply our four tips:

00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:32.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
know your territory,

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:36.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
make use of the Teaching Toolbox,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
try to anticipate
common objections or questions,

00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:43.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then adjust to the householder’s needs,

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:45.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
by applying these,

00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:50.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll find very quickly
that we are having meaningful conversations

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:53.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are able to share targeted truths

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:56.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those most in need.

00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:01.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
As always, these are just a few techniques

00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:03.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have worked for me,

00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:06.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I hope they work for you.

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:10.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, part of the beauty of our ministry

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:14.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we continue to sharpen one another.
