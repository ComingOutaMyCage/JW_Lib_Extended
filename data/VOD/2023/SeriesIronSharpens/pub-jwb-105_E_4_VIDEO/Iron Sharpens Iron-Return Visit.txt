00:00:01 Hi, I’m Marcelo, and this is “Iron Sharpens Iron.”
00:00:14 So we’ve made the initial call,
00:00:16 and it went really well.
00:00:18 We were able to share a scripture,
00:00:20 we had a nice conversation,
00:00:22 and we even left the person with a question.
00:00:25 But then we have to make what
00:00:27 for some brothers and sisters is somewhat difficult:
00:00:31 the dreaded return visit.
00:00:33 But why do some of us feel that way?
00:00:37 Well, we might worry, thinking:
00:00:40 ‘I tried to return quickly, but they weren’t there,
00:00:44 ‘so will they even remember me?
00:00:46 ‘Will they still be interested?
00:00:49 Will they ask me a question I’m not prepared for?’
00:00:53 All of these might be legitimate concerns,
00:00:56 but we need to remember
00:00:58 that our goal at this moment is just to continue a conversation.
00:01:03 It’s better to focus on what we do know.
00:01:07 This person has already shown interest.
00:01:10 Remembering that can help minimize uneasiness.
00:01:16 But let’s also look at three practical steps
00:01:19 that give us the best chance for a successful return visit.
00:01:23 The first step is to be warm and friendly.
00:01:27 So focus on just getting yourself relaxed.
00:01:30 That way you can be warm and friendly when you greet them.
00:01:34 It’s natural for some of us to feel a measure of anxiety
00:01:38 conversing with someone we don’t know well.
00:01:41 But if we’ve prepared well ahead of time,
00:01:45 we can now take a deep breath,
00:01:47 focus on the value of the message, and smile.
00:01:50 This can help us to relax,
00:01:53 and often our smile is contagious.
00:01:55 I’m Laura.
00:01:56 The last time I was here, we talked about who controls the world.
00:02:01 Yes, I remember.
00:02:02 You even showed me it is the Devil, right?
00:02:04 Yeah, that’s right.
00:02:06 If you have a few minutes,
00:02:07 I want to answer the question that I left with you last time:
00:02:10 Why does God allow suffering?
00:02:13 Did you notice how she didn’t put the householder on the spot?
00:02:17 She reminded the woman of her name
00:02:19 and also of the topic they had discussed on the initial call.
00:02:23 Now she can continue her discussion right where she left off.
00:02:27 Why does God allow suffering?
00:02:29 I’m kind of busy right now,
00:02:31 but do you mind if I ask you a question?
00:02:35 Now, this is the moment we sometimes fear most.
00:02:40 We plan to continue the discussion,
00:02:42 but the householder has an unexpected question.
00:02:46 So here’s one approach that works well
00:02:50 if we would like to have more time to prepare a response.
00:02:54 I’d like to know if the Bible says anything about gay marriage.
00:02:59 You know, that’s a really good question.
00:03:02 Well, in a way it does talk about that.
00:03:06 But would it be OK with you if I answered this other question first?
00:03:10 Then I can do some research and find the best possible scriptures
00:03:13 to be able to answer your question the next time that I come.
00:03:15 Does that sound OK?
00:03:17 Sure, that’s fine.
00:03:18 Did you see how our sister just gave an honest response?
00:03:22 We can simply ask if it would be OK to continue our current discussion
00:03:26 so we can do some research and return with a better answer.
00:03:30 Most householders will appreciate that.
00:03:34 But if the question isn’t too difficult
00:03:37 or if we feel comfortable giving our response,
00:03:40 that’s fine.
00:03:41 We can always adapt.
00:03:43 The idea is to try to continue our discussion
00:03:47 but, if necessary, we can always adjust it.
00:03:51 And here’s our last tip:
00:03:54 Leave them wanting more.
00:03:57 Make sure to keep our visit brief and leave them wanting more.
00:04:02 What approach can we use?
00:04:04 Set up a question for the next visit.
00:04:08 Huh, that’s interesting.
00:04:09 So this thought leads us to another question.
00:04:12 If God allows suffering to happen, when will he put an end to it?
00:04:16 That’s a good question.
00:04:18 But since I mentioned I would be brief,
00:04:20 could I maybe come back Saturday?
00:04:23 Then I can answer this question and also the other one you asked.
00:04:26 Yeah, that would be great.
00:04:28 There it is!
00:04:29 Three easy steps that can help us be more comfortable
00:04:33 and also help us make successful return visits:
00:04:37 Be warm and friendly,
00:04:39 continue our discussion,
00:04:40 and leave them wanting more.
00:04:43 I know these tips have helped me,
00:04:45 and I sure hope they help you
00:04:47 as we work together to sharpen one another.
