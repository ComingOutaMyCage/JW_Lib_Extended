Hi, I’m Marcelo,
and this is <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.”</i>

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:16.453 line:10% position:50% align:center
So we’ve made the initial call,

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.372 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it went really well.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to share a scripture,

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had a nice conversation,

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we even left the person with a question.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we have to make what

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some brothers and sisters
is somewhat difficult:

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:33.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dreaded return visit.

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why do some of us feel that way?

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:40.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we might worry, thinking:

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I tried to return quickly,
but they weren’t there,

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘so will they even remember me?

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will they still be interested?

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will they ask me a question
I’m not prepared for?’

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:56.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these might be legitimate concerns,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we need to remember

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:03.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our goal at this moment
is just to continue a conversation.

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:07.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s better to focus on what we do know.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
This person has already shown interest.

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remembering that
can help minimize uneasiness.

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s also look at three practical steps

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:23.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
that give us the best chance
for a successful return visit.

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first step is to be warm and friendly.

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
So focus on just getting yourself relaxed.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:33.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way you can be warm and friendly
when you greet them.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s natural for some of us
to feel a measure of anxiety

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
conversing with someone we don’t know well.

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we’ve prepared well ahead of time,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can now take a deep breath,

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:50.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
focus on the value of the message, and smile.

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can help us to relax,

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and often our smile is contagious.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:56.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m Laura.

00:01:56.804 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last time I was here,
we talked about who controls the world.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:02.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I remember.

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:04.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
You even showed me it is the Devil, right?

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s right.

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:07.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have a few minutes,

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:10.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to answer the question
that I left with you last time:

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does God allow suffering?

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:17.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice how she
didn’t put the householder on the spot?

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:19.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
She reminded the woman of her name

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:23.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also of the topic they had discussed
on the initial call.

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:27.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now she can continue her discussion
right where she left off.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does God allow suffering?

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:31.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m kind of busy right now,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
but do you mind if I ask you a question?

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:40.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is the moment
we sometimes fear most.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:42.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
We plan to continue the discussion,

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:46.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the householder has
an unexpected question.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s one approach that works well

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:53.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we would like to have more time
to prepare a response.

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:58.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to know if the Bible says anything
about gay marriage.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, that’s a really good question.

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a way it does talk about that.

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:10.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
But would it be OK with you
if I answered this other question first?

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I can do some research
and find the best possible scriptures

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to answer your question
the next time that I come.

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:17.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that sound OK?

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:18.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure, that’s fine.

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:22.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how our sister
just gave an honest response?

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:26.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can simply ask if it would be OK
to continue our current discussion

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:30.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we can do some research
and return with a better answer.

00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:33.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most householders will appreciate that.

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:37.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if the question isn’t too difficult

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if we feel comfortable
giving our response,

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:41.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s fine.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can always adapt.

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:47.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
The idea is to try to continue our discussion

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:50.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, if necessary, we can always adjust it.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s our last tip:

00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leave them wanting more.

00:03:57.424 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make sure to keep our visit brief
and leave them wanting more.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
What approach can we use?

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:07.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Set up a question for the next visit.

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:09.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Huh, that’s interesting.

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this thought leads us to another question.

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:16.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
If God allows suffering to happen,
when will he put an end to it?

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:18.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good question.

00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
But since I mentioned I would be brief,

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
could I maybe come back Saturday?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I can answer this question
and also the other one you asked.

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:28.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that would be great.

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:29.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it is!

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three easy steps
that can help us be more comfortable

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:37.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also help us make
successful return visits:

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:39.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be warm and friendly,

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue our discussion,

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leave them wanting more.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:45.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know these tips have helped me,

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:47.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I sure hope they help you

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:50.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we work together to sharpen one another.
