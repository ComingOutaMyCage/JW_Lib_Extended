00:00:07 Why was it difficult to uphold God’s moral standards at school?
00:00:13 I remember that in high school it was complicated
00:00:16 because my classmates made fun of me.
00:00:18 They often said I acted holier-than-thou and other similar insults
00:00:22 because I didn’t go to nightclubs, I didn’t curse, I didn’t smoke.
00:00:26 It was unbearable because they often tried to push me to the limit.
00:00:29 I had a one-hour bus ride to get to high school,
00:00:32 and I wanted the bus to make a U-turn and avoid going to high school.
00:00:36 I had all the time to think
00:00:38 of what could happen to me and what they could say to me,
00:00:40 and I admit that I sometimes felt alone.
00:00:44 The environment at school often exposed me to immorality.
00:00:47 For example, girls would wear short skirts.
00:00:50 I received instant messages
00:00:52 from people I had never met before.
00:00:54 They would send me photos,
00:00:56 a phone number, or invitations that I could have just simply accepted.
00:01:01 So I could have easily committed sexual immorality.
00:01:05 Sometimes I felt like I was missing out on something important
00:01:09 when I heard my classmates talking about what they were doing
00:01:12 on their evenings and weekends
00:01:13 and about drinking alcohol and new drugs they were trying
00:01:17 or girls they had slept with.
00:01:20 I started to become curious.
00:01:26 What did you do to strengthen your faith?
00:01:32 During family worship with my parents,
00:01:35 we studied the example of Daniel.
00:01:37 Far from his family
00:01:38 among people that didn’t serve Jehovah,
00:01:41 he succeeded in remaining faithful,
00:01:44 and I wanted to do the same.
00:01:46 To strengthen my faith,
00:01:48 I started reading the Bible.
00:01:49 I had to take the metro to get to school,
00:01:51 so every morning I took the opportunity to read a few verses.
00:01:54 I thought about the verses I had read.
00:01:57 By praying to Jehovah,
00:01:59 having a kind of constant conversation with him,
00:02:02 Jehovah would put me in a little bubble.
00:02:04 I started feeling comfortable inside,
00:02:06 and I was no longer under the bad influence of others.
00:02:09 And the fact that I prayed more also made me feel closer to Jehovah.
00:02:14 It was a bit like Psalm 63:7,
00:02:17 which describes how Jehovah shelters us under his immense wings.
00:02:21 Well, that’s exactly how I felt.
00:02:23 Prayer allowed me to face any temptation.
00:02:33 Why do you believe that Jehovah’s standards are beneficial?
00:02:38 I closely observed the young ones in the world,
00:02:41 and I realized that they are suffering from the standards they follow.
00:02:46 I closely stick to the moral standards that Jehovah has given me.
00:02:50 I’m aware that they are there for my benefit,
00:02:52 because with the experiences I’ve had in school,
00:02:54 I’ve observed the painful consequences that my classmates have suffered.
00:02:59 Some got into trouble with the law
00:03:01 or got sick.
00:03:03 They’ve had health problems caused by their lifestyle.
00:03:07 A girl in school did something immoral with a boy,
00:03:10 and it started circulating around the school.
00:03:13 Because of that,
00:03:15 the girl didn’t come to school anymore,
00:03:17 and she started having suicidal thoughts.
00:03:20 I understood that Jehovah protects us with his principles, his standards.
00:03:26 And if I had compromised even once with his standards,
00:03:29 I would have regretted it sooner or later.
00:03:32 And for me, there is nothing worse than regret.
00:03:35 I’m 100 percent sure that Jehovah gave me
00:03:38 these moral principles for my own good
00:03:41 so that I could be morally clean.
00:03:44 He also helps me to be positive.
00:03:46 For example, he helped me to see my classmates
00:03:48 as potential disciples,
00:03:50 and we were able to have conversations about the Bible together.
00:03:52 I am really convinced that Jehovah’s standards are good for me.
00:03:57 Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses is the best life possible.
