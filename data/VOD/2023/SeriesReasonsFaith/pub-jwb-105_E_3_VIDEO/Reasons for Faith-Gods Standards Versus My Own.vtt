00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was it difficult to uphold
God’s moral standards at school?

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember that in high school
it was complicated

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my classmates made fun of me.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
They often said I acted holier-than-thou
and other similar insults

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I didn’t go to nightclubs,
I didn’t curse, I didn’t smoke.

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was unbearable because they
often tried to push me to the limit.

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:32.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a one-hour bus ride
to get to high school,

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wanted the bus to make a U-turn
and avoid going to high school.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had all the time to think

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what could happen to me
and what they could say to me,

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I admit that I sometimes felt alone.

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
The environment at school
often exposed me to immorality.

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, girls would wear short skirts.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
I received instant messages

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:54.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
from people I had never met before.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would send me photos,

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
a phone number, or invitations
that I could have just simply accepted.

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I could have easily committed
sexual immorality.

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:09.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I felt like
I was missing out on something important

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I heard my classmates
talking about what they were doing

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:13.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their evenings and weekends

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and about drinking alcohol
and new drugs they were trying

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:19.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
or girls they had slept with.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:23.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to become curious.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:34.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
During family worship with my parents,

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
we studied the example of Daniel.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Far from his family

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:41.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
among people that didn’t serve Jehovah,

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
he succeeded in remaining faithful,

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wanted to do the same.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:48.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
To strengthen my faith,

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started reading the Bible.

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to take the metro to get to school,

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
so every morning I took the opportunity
to read a few verses. 

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:56.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought about the verses I had read.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:01:59.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
By praying to Jehovah,

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
having a kind of
constant conversation with him,

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:04.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would put me in a little bubble.

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started feeling comfortable inside,

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:09.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was no longer
under the bad influence of others.

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the fact that I prayed more
also made me feel closer to Jehovah.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a bit like Psalm 63:7,

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:21.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
which describes how Jehovah shelters us
under his immense wings.

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:23.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s exactly how I felt.

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayer allowed me to face any temptation.

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:36.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you believe
that Jehovah’s standards are beneficial?

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:41.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
I closely observed
the young ones in the world,

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:45.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I realized that they are suffering
from the standards they follow.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
I closely stick to the moral standards
that Jehovah has given me.

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:52.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m aware that they are there for my benefit,

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
because with the experiences
I’ve had in school,

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:58.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve observed the painful consequences
that my classmates have suffered.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:01.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some got into trouble with the law

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:03.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
or got sick.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve had health problems
caused by their lifestyle.

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:10.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
A girl in school
did something immoral with a boy,

00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it started circulating around the school.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of that,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
the girl didn’t come to school anymore,

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:19.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she started having suicidal thoughts.

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:25.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understood that Jehovah protects us
with his principles, his standards.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if I had compromised
even once with his standards,

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:32.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would have regretted it sooner or later.

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for me,
there is nothing worse than regret.

00:03:35.527 --> 00:03:38.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m 100 percent sure that Jehovah gave me

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
these moral principles for my own good

00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:43.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I could be morally clean.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also helps me to be positive.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, he helped me
to see my classmates

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:50.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
as potential disciples,

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were able to have conversations
about the Bible together.

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am really convinced
that Jehovah’s standards are good for me.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
is the best life possible.
