Have you been infected?

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, not with an actual virus,

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:13.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with something
that has infected people throughout history,

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
something that no one is completely immune to

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
—prejudice.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Whoa! Whoa!’ you may think,

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Prejudice—me?

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘That can’t be right.

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:26.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like all kinds of people!’

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:30.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is that all of us are capable of

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:33.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even guilty of prejudice to some degree.

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:36.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it can be hard to recognize in ourselves.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is prejudice?

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
To overcome prejudice,
you have to understand what it is.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prejudice often means
having a biased opinion,

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:51.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
either good or bad,
of someone you don’t even know.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be prejudiced against people
and even treat them badly

00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:59.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
simply because of their age,

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they’re from,

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they look like,

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:08.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much money they have,

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:14.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
or because of other things
that make people different from us.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:19.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
But judging others
based on appearances or superficial traits

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
before getting to know them
would be unfair and unreasonable.

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be like hating a food
before you’ve even tried it.

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:30.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prejudice can lead us
to give special treatment to some people

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and exclude others.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can make us act like we’re smarter

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
or better than people who are different.

00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:40.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that can be dangerous.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:43.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says at Proverbs 16:18

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “pride is before a crash,

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a haughty spirit before stumbling.”

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having a superior attitude
can keep us from having real friends.

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can take the joy out of life.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you recognize prejudice in your heart,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
what can you do?

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:02.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try these steps:

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Learn more about those around you.

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have they experienced in their life?

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:09.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are their talents?

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:16.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you appreciate others’ strengths,

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:19.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can be a powerful antidote to prejudice.

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, take a look at your friends.

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:25.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do they all look, think,

00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and act a lot like you?

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, follow the Bible’s advice

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Corinthians 6:13 and “widen out.”

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make friends with people
who are different from you.

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if you discover

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:43.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some of them practice bad things?

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:46.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that case, stay away!

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their bad conduct can make you act badly.

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:54.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this world, prejudice is everywhere.

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we don’t have to let it
control our thinking.

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:03.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can overcome prejudice

00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:05.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we avoid
reaching negative conclusions about people

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:07.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we get to know them,

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:10.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
make an effort to learn about others,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
and try to make friends with people
who are different from us.

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more we know
about the people around us,

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:20.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more we can appreciate
the things that make us different.
