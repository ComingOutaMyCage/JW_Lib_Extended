00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:09.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is marriage a source of happiness

00:00:10.283 --> 00:00:12.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
or heartbreak?

00:00:13.287 --> 00:00:17.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many married couples
just endure unhappily,

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:22.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
other couples separate,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and large numbers end in divorce.

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:30.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet,

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:34.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
some have found
great happiness and contentment in marriage.

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:00:36.483 --> 00:00:38.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
What makes the difference?

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:43.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have learned God’s view of marriage

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in the Bible.

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:50.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, God originated marriage,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he wants married couples to be happy.

00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:56.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does God view marriage?

00:00:57.342 --> 00:01:01.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says
that God “‘made them male and female’ . . .

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:05.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
What God has yoked together,
let no man put apart.”

00:01:07.313 --> 00:01:10.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
God views marriage as a permanent bond

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
between a man and a woman.

00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:14.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants them to be faithful to each other.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
By following the Bible’s advice

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
to legalize their marriage,

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
a couple show that they recognize

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
the importance of their union

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they enjoy greater security.

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:32.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they view their marriage as permanent,

00:01:32.553 --> 00:01:34.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re more likely to work together

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:36.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
to solve their problems.

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:39.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the Bible realistically acknowledges

00:01:39.812 --> 00:01:43.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
that couples will face challenges,

00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:45.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
it also provides advice from God

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps to work through disagreements.

00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:51.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the Bible says:

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Each one of you must love his wife

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as he does himself;

00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:58.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the other hand,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the wife should have deep respect

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
for her husband.”

00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:03.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the Bible,

00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:06.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
God teaches couples to display qualities

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
that build a happy marriage,

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:13.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
like being kind, patient, and forgiving.

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:17.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible also emphasizes the value

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:19.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
of being a good listener.

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:23.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regardless of how long
two people have been married,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
they can find happiness

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:28.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they share God’s view of marriage.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you need help in your marriage

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:34.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to money problems,

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
health issues,

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:39.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
relatives,

00:02:39.554 --> 00:02:41.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
or raising children?
