00:00:02 “This book of the Law
00:00:04 “should not depart from your mouth,
00:00:07 “and you must read it
00:00:09 “in an undertone day and night,
00:00:11 “in order to observe carefully
00:00:13 “all that is written in it;
00:00:15 “for then your way will be successful
00:00:18 and then you will act wisely.”
00:00:23 The Bible is enjoyed in many different formats,
00:00:28 one of which is the audio edition of the New World Translation.
00:00:34 “The good news according to Matthew.”
00:00:36 But how is it produced?
00:00:38 Let’s take a closer look.
00:00:42 When we first heard that the Governing Body wanted to record
00:00:45 the revised edition of the New World Translation,
00:00:47 I think all of us knew that it was going to be a big job.
00:00:51 The narrator is one voice,
00:00:53 and all the other characters
00:00:58 are different voices.
00:01:00 It’s not a dramatic Bible reading,
00:01:03 but it’s a reading with a high level of realism.
00:01:06 There’s no music, no sound effects, just voices.
00:01:10 We were surprised to find out how many characters there were in the Bible.
00:01:13 The Bible is a really big book.
00:01:15 I don’t think any of us realized how big of a job it would be.
00:01:19 This is not a little project.
00:01:20 This is huge!
00:01:25 The research really is one of the items
00:01:27 that is very fundamental, basic.
00:01:30 It is very important to get the facts together.
00:01:33 The Bible is true life;
00:01:35 it’s what really happened to real people.
00:01:38 We had to break down who the voices were.
00:01:42 And then we had to give each character a unique name to identify him.
00:01:46 If he’s not named in the Bible, . . .
00:01:48 We have to just give them descriptions that are in the context,
00:01:51 like “Third Jew” or “First in the crowd.”
00:01:54 We were given a room
00:01:57 —a fair-sized room.
00:01:58 And we used it to make a list
00:02:01 of all of the characters in all four Gospels.
00:02:05 We began with the book of Matthew,
00:02:07 and we had to determine the parallel accounts
00:02:11 between the different Gospel writers.
00:02:13 You’ll have to use the same voice for a character.
00:02:16 If he appears in one book, he needs to be the same voice in the other books.
00:02:20 Like in Matthew chapter 21,
00:02:23 we have this report where Matthew simply says,
00:02:26 well, the disciples say that ‘the fig tree has withered.’
00:02:29 But who are the disciples?
00:02:31 Did they all say it at the same time?
00:02:33 So if you check in Mark, for example, Mark is very specific.
00:02:37 He says that Peter said: “The fig tree . . . has withered.”
00:02:41 The Art Department took those maps and charts in the appendix
00:02:45 and blew them up into poster size for us as we were deciding
00:02:49 who said what and where they were and how to name the characters.
00:02:51 It was very helpful to have that.
00:02:53 All that gets put into a database, what kind of attributes they had
00:02:57 —age, where they were from,
00:02:59 what kind of traits they were expressing in their quotations.
00:03:04 When the Bible talks about Jehovah speaking,
00:03:08 well, was it really Jehovah himself who spoke?
00:03:12 Well, something we know is that at least
00:03:14 on three occasions it was Jehovah who spoke.
00:03:17 This was when Jesus was on earth.
00:03:18 We compiled most of the research,
00:03:20 and then it was forwarded on to Writing Research.
00:03:23 We have a large library here at Bethel
00:03:26 that is focusing especially on Biblical subjects.
00:03:30 And we’re using this quite a bit
00:03:32 because we need to make sure that what we say is solid.
00:03:36 We are a people for Jehovah, and we are really—
00:03:40 Everything we say, it’s based on the Bible.
00:03:42 We don’t want to read too much into Bible accounts.
00:03:44 And we don’t want to read it in a way that steers incorrectly.
00:03:51 To start with, Who’s at Bethel?
00:03:53 We have an audition bank
00:03:54 here in Audio/Video.
00:03:56 We poured through hundreds of auditions.
00:03:58 We had a brother from Africa that we auditioned over the Internet.
00:04:01 He’s sitting there reading into a mic;
00:04:04 I’m watching him.
00:04:05 By the time we tallied all of the characters for the entire Bible,
00:04:09 we realized we had about a thousand characters.
00:04:13 So a thousand voices that we’ll need to find.
00:04:18 There was a reading seminar at which we were taught
00:04:22 every aspect of reading.
00:04:24 And that was very effective because it reminded us of a lot of things:
00:04:29 dos and don’ts for effective reading.
00:04:31 It really gave me the confidence and understanding that I think I can do this.
00:04:35 Some of the roles are very small.
00:04:37 Those short, very short passages
00:04:40 —those one-sentence lines
00:04:42 that we would call a person in for—
00:04:46 were some of the hardest to coach.
00:04:50 When I initially was asked to participate in the Bible reading,
00:04:54 I was so excited.
00:04:55 And then I saw that it was one line, and I thought:
00:04:57 ‘OK, well, it won’t be too bad. It will be easy.’
00:05:00 And then I listened to the Bible reading seminar,
00:05:03 and it really helped me to take it more seriously.
00:05:07 We would even ask the readers to study this over.
00:05:11 You only have one sentence, but study all about this character.
00:05:15 I read the chapter. I read the Insight  book.
00:05:18 And I realized that this is more
00:05:22 than just saying one line.
00:05:24 What we have found is that it’s a good idea
00:05:27 to provide the reader with a script that has been customized.
00:05:31 I have the word written out phonetically
00:05:33 so that you would know better how to pronounce it.
00:05:35 I would say, “Sulomon.”
00:05:36 Sulomon? Who’s he?
00:05:37 It’s that kind of thing.
00:05:39 So anyway, they helped you pronounce “Solomon.”
00:05:42 And they were very careful to make sure the pronunciation was accurate.
00:05:46 And that it would be consistent and accurate
00:05:49 all the way through the Bible reading from beginning to end.
00:05:55 So when the character comes in,
00:05:56 we try to help them to kind of think about the context.
00:05:59 Of course, they have already done that in their own research and practice
00:06:02 but a little bit more about, maybe, the motive of the character.
00:06:05 How would they have felt in this particular instance?
00:06:08 How would they say this line?
00:06:10 But we also want to make sure the brothers and sisters feel really comfortable,
00:06:13 and it often takes a long time to get them to relax.
00:06:18 In the control room,
00:06:20 there are basically three roles and the reader.
00:06:24 The follower is responsible to make sure that all of the content is there
00:06:28 —to make sure that no words are missing.
00:06:30 During the recording, the audio engineer is listening for anything
00:06:33 that will distract the listeners: stomach noises or shirt noise
00:06:38 or if the brother is wearing suspenders.
00:06:40 The coach is responsible for the quality of teaching.
00:06:43 I love watching the coach try to get the right emotion out of the reader.
00:06:47 So then, you might read a line,
00:06:49 and he’ll say, “Can you say that again with a smile?”
00:06:51 And it’s amazing because then it sounds more joyful.
00:06:54 And then once you capture the emotion, then it naturally comes out.
00:06:57 You’re not trying to copy what he’s told you to say.
00:07:00 What we usually have a person do is start with one emotion
00:07:04 —that you’re sad— and then add each emotion on top.
00:07:08 That ends up getting a very complex delivery of a line.
00:07:13 There are so many possible ways to say one line,
00:07:16 and I didn’t even realize how many.
00:07:17 You think you know how the character said it,
00:07:22 and then the coach will give you a suggestion.
00:07:28 So the editing process actually begins during the recording.
00:07:32 And then when we get done recording, perhaps a chapter,
00:07:35 we’ll take down the best takes of every verse
00:07:38 because the reader and the coach can then listen back and see,
00:07:40 “OK, do we like how it sounds?”
00:07:42 We use professional software to do the editing,
00:07:45 and that means we do all the spacing that’s needed;
00:07:47 we pull in all the characters for a specific chapter.
00:07:49 Because we record each voice individually,
00:07:52 it’s not a group of people around the microphone having the conversation.
00:07:55 So each character is done,
00:07:57 and then if there are multiple voices in a chapter,
00:08:00 then we pull them all together.
00:08:02 Once we started editing these chapters together,
00:08:05 a beautiful artwork of truth
00:08:09 as you’re seeing the context jump out,
00:08:12 and for us to then feel it
00:08:14 and move us as the reader of God’s Word,
00:08:18 hearer of God’s Word.
00:08:22 The comment I’ve heard over and over again is,
00:08:27 “It’s brought the Bible to life in my mind and heart.”
00:08:32 And it has encouraged us
00:08:35 to meditate deeper into God’s Word.
00:08:39 Having the different characters read the voices
00:08:43 is going to be such a comfort to all of us.
00:08:46 I think that this is really going to make Bible reading exciting.
00:08:50 So now the Bible is alive, and what a difference it makes!
00:08:55 I think they’re going to love it!
