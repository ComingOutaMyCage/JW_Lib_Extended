“This book of the Law

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:07.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“should not depart from your mouth,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you must read it

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:11.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in an undertone day and night,

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:13.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to observe carefully

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:15.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all that is written in it;

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for then your way will be successful

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:22.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then you will act wisely.”

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is enjoyed
in many different formats,

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:33.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of which is the audio edition
of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The good news according to Matthew.”

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how is it produced?

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:40.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a closer look.

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:45.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we first heard
that the Governing Body wanted to record

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
the revised edition
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:51.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think all of us knew
that it was going to be a big job.

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:53.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
The narrator is one voice,

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:58.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the other characters

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:00.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
are different voices.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a dramatic Bible reading,

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s a reading
with a high level of realism.

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:10.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no music,
no sound effects, just voices.

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:13.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were surprised to find out how
many characters there were in the Bible.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is a really big book.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:19.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think any of us realized
how big of a job it would be.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not a little project.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:22.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is huge!

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:27.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
The research really is one of the items

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is very fundamental, basic.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:33.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is very important
to get the facts together.

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is true life;

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s what really happened to real people.

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:42.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to break down who the voices were.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:46.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we had to give
each character a unique name to identify him.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he’s not named in the Bible, . . .

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to just give them descriptions
that are in the context,

00:01:51.628 --> 00:01:54.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
like “Third Jew” or “First in the crowd.”

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:57.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were given a room

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a fair-sized room.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we used it to make a list

00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:05.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all of the characters in all four Gospels.

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:07.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
We began with the book of Matthew,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we had to determine the parallel accounts

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the different Gospel writers.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll have to use the same voice
for a character.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:20.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he appears in one book, he needs to be
the same voice in the other books.

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like in Matthew chapter 21,

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have this report
where Matthew simply says,

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, the disciples say
that ‘the fig tree has withered.’

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:31.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who are the disciples?

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:33.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they all say it at the same time?

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:37.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you check in Mark,
for example, Mark is very specific.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says that Peter said:
“The fig tree . . . has withered.”

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:45.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Art Department
took those maps and charts in the appendix

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
and blew them up into poster size
for us as we were deciding

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:51.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
who said what and where they were
and how to name the characters.

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:53.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very helpful to have that.

00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:57.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
All that gets put into a database,
what kind of attributes they had

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
—age, where they were from,

00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:04.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of traits
they were expressing in their quotations.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:08.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Bible talks about Jehovah speaking,

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, was it really Jehovah
himself who spoke?

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, something we know is that at least

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:17.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
on three occasions it was Jehovah who spoke.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was when Jesus was on earth.

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:20.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
We compiled most of the research,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then it was forwarded
on to Writing Research.

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:26.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a large library here at Bethel

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is focusing
especially on Biblical subjects.

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:32.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re using this quite a bit

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we need to make sure
that what we say is solid.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:40.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are a people for Jehovah,
and we are really—

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:42.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything we say,
it’s based on the Bible.

00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:44.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t want to read too much
into Bible accounts.

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:48.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t want to read it
in a way that steers incorrectly.

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:53.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
To start with, Who’s at Bethel?

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have an audition bank

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
here in Audio/Video.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
We poured through hundreds of auditions.

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a brother from Africa
that we auditioned over the Internet.

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:04.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s sitting there reading into a mic;

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:05.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m watching him.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:09.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the time we tallied
all of the characters for the entire Bible,

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:13.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
we realized we had
about a thousand characters.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a thousand voices that we’ll need to find.

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a reading seminar
at which we were taught

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:24.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
every aspect of reading.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was very effective
because it reminded us of a lot of things:

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:31.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
dos and don’ts for effective reading.

00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really gave me the confidence
and understanding that I think I can do this.

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the roles are very small.

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:40.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those short, very short passages

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:42.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those one-sentence lines

00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:46.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would call a person in for—

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
were some of the hardest to coach.

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:54.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I initially was asked
to participate in the Bible reading,

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:55.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so excited.

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:57.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I saw that it was one line,
and I thought:

00:04:57.981 --> 00:05:00.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘OK, well, it won’t be too bad.
It will be easy.’

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I listened
to the Bible reading seminar,

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it really helped me
to take it more seriously.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:11.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would even ask the readers
to study this over.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:15.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
You only have one sentence,
but study all about this character.

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
I read the chapter.
I read the <i>Insight </i> book.

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:22.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I realized that this is more

00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:24.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just saying one line.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we have found is that it’s a good idea

00:05:27.377 --> 00:05:31.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide the reader
with a script that has been customized.

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have the word written out phonetically

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you would know better
how to pronounce it.

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:36.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say, “Sulomon.”

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sulomon?
Who’s he?

00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:39.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s that kind of thing.

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:42.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
So anyway, they helped you
pronounce “Solomon.”

00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:46.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were very careful
to make sure the pronunciation was accurate.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that it would be consistent and accurate

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:52.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the way through the Bible reading
from beginning to end.

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:56.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the character comes in,

00:05:56.973 --> 00:05:59.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
we try to help them
to kind of think about the context.

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:02.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, they have already done
that in their own research and practice

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a little bit more about,
maybe, the motive of the character.

00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:08.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would they have felt
in this particular instance?

00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:10.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would they say this line?

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also want to make sure the brothers
and sisters feel really comfortable,

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:18.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it often takes a long time
to get them to relax.

00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:20.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the control room,

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:24.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are basically
three roles and the reader.

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:28.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
The follower is responsible to make sure
that all of the content is there

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to make sure that no words are missing.

00:06:30.573 --> 00:06:33.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the recording,
the audio engineer is listening for anything

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:38.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will distract the listeners:
stomach noises or shirt noise

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:40.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if the brother is wearing suspenders.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:43.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
The coach is responsible
for the quality of teaching.

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:47.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love watching the coach try to get
the right emotion out of the reader.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then, you might read a line,

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll say,
“Can you say that again with a smile?”

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s amazing
because then it sounds more joyful.

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:57.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then once you capture the emotion,
then it naturally comes out.

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:00.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not trying to copy
what he’s told you to say.

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:04.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we usually have a person do
is start with one emotion

00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:08.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that you’re sad—
and then add each emotion on top.

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:13.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
That ends up getting
a very complex delivery of a line.

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many possible ways
to say one line,

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:17.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t even realize how many.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
You think you know how the character said it,

00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:25.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the coach
will give you a suggestion.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:32.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the editing process actually begins
during the recording.

00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:35.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then when we get done recording,
perhaps a chapter,

00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:38.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll take down the best takes of every verse

00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:40.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the reader and the coach
can then listen back and see,

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:42.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“OK, do we like how it sounds?”

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
We use professional software
to do the editing,

00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that means we do all
the spacing that’s needed;

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
we pull in all the characters
for a specific chapter.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we record each voice individually,

00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:55.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not a group of people around
the microphone having the conversation.

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:57.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
So each character is done,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then if there are
multiple voices in a chapter,

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:02.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we pull them all together.

00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:05.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once we started editing
these chapters together,

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful artwork of truth

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:12.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you’re seeing the context jump out,

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:14.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for us to then feel it

00:08:14.777 --> 00:08:18.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move us as the reader of God’s Word,

00:08:18.948 --> 00:08:20.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
hearer of God’s Word.

00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:26.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
The comment I’ve heard
over and over again is,

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s brought the Bible to life
in my mind and heart.”

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it has encouraged us

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:39.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meditate deeper into God’s Word.

00:08:39.802 --> 00:08:43.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having the different characters
read the voices

00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:46.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be such a comfort to all of us.

00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:50.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think that this is really going to make
Bible reading exciting.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now the Bible is alive,
and what a difference it makes!

00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:58.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think they’re going to love it!
