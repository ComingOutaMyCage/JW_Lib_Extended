00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:05.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was terrible.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:07.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could’ve answered that better.

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:11.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you did great, really.

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:14.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve always been hard on myself.

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:16.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
... strengthen our faith.

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:18.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then if we,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
um, um—

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, that’s all.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes it made me so anxious

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even the normal stuff I did

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt impossible.

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:54.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you think brings this on?

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know, maybe—

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe lately it’s
because I’m thinking about SKE.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I can reach that goal, it’ll be fine.

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:09.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about we read
a scripture that might help?

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:14.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:18.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t discourage me from SKE.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they suggested
that I try to manage the anxiety first.

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:26.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was on it!

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:29.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I focused on my goal

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took care of myself, I’d get there.

00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:54.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it was a little too much focus.

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:07.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers.

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:16.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
So?

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:18.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re right.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
SKE would be a lot for me right now.

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:27.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, but you’ll get there.

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried everything to fix this.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:32.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s wrong with me?

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:34.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:36.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some things just take time.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, I have Lilly’s study tomorrow morning.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could use your help.

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:47.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to get baptized,

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I don’t know.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
You all do so much.

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:05.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think I could ever really be . . .

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:15.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I understand.

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:17.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I show you something?

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Micah 6:8

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
—would you read that?

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:28.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has told you, O man, what is good.

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:31.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And what is
Jehovah requiring of you?

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:35.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Only to exercise justice,
to cherish loyalty,

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to walk in modesty with your God!”

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:42.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
That last part, “walk in modesty,”

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s about knowing our limitations.

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
So is Jehovah happy

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:52.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
with what you can do,

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
or does he want what you can’t do?

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
He only expects what I can do.

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:05.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then why should we expect more?

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:09.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
It turns out I gave Lilly
the same advice the brothers gave me.

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:11.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was my turn to apply it.

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:16.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to be honest with myself.

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:21.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
My limitation was my own high expectation.

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d been doing it so long
that there was no quick fix.

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:29.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t mean giving up on my goals, though.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just tried to focus more
on what I could do in the present,

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:43.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
like having more empathy
for people who feel like I do

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:49.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showing them
how much Jehovah values them.

00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:58.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could tell a Bible student how we, um,

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:01.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we overcame a challenge.

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:02.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
That might . . .

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is,
I can actually do a lot for Jehovah

00:05:09.163 --> 00:05:12.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
with reasonable expectations.
