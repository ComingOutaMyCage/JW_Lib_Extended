00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every year, plants,

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:18.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
bacteria, and algae earth wide

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:21.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
make around 150 billion metric tons
(165 billion tons) of food

00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:23.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
for themselves

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:26.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and almost every other living thing on earth.

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:29.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do they do it?

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Photosynthesis.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:38.486 line:10% position:50% align:center
In plants,

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:40.823 line:10% position:50% align:center
this astonishingly intricate process

00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:42.992 line:10% position:50% align:center
takes place in a highly organized structure

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:45.036 line:10% position:50% align:center
called a chloroplast,

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:48.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
where a green pigment, chlorophyll,

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:50.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other pigments collect

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and use the energy from visible light

00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:54.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
with amazing efficiency.

00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:00.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
In photosynthesis,
this energy is used

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:04.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something that happens
nowhere else in the natural world

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:08.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
—split water into hydrogen ions
and oxygen molecules.

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:13.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hydrogen ions
combine with carbon dioxide to make sugar,

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
which can be used by plants to make

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the other complex molecules

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they need to grow.

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of the oxygen
is expelled as an unused by-product,

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that we can’t live without.

00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:35.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
About half of the oxygen

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:37.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
we and other organisms breathe

00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:39.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes from phytoplankton,

00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:42.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
microscopic organisms
that drift in the ocean.

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:48.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the smallest one yet discovered,
a cyanobacterium,

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:50.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
is also the most abundant.

00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:54.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though invisible to the naked eye,
these bacteria alone

00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:57.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
produce around one fifth
of the oxygen on earth.

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nearly all living things need oxygen,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they depend
on other life-forms to make it.

00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:10.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
The amazingly complex process
of combining carbon dioxide

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:14.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the water
that constantly cycles on our planet

00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:16.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and energy from the sun

00:02:17.822 --> 00:02:19.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us every bite of food

00:02:19.825 --> 00:02:21.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every breath of air we need.

00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:24.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:02:24.998 --> 00:02:27.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did photosynthesis evolve?

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:30.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or was it designed?
