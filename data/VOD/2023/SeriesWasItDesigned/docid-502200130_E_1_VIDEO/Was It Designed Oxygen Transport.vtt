00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:12.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day,
we take around 25,000 breaths of air.

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:17.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
And each breath
contains a gas essential for life

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
—oxygen.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:22.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need a steady supply of oxygen

00:00:22.382 --> 00:00:27.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our body cells use it
to produce energy from the food we eat.

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:30.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does oxygen get from your lungs

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:33.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the trillions of individual cells
throughout your body?

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you take a breath,

00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:40.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
oxygen passes from your lungs

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:42.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
into your bloodstream,

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:43.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it’s transported

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the workhorses of oxygen transport

00:00:46.537 --> 00:00:48.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
—red blood cells.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:52.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their unique shape and composition

00:00:52.837 --> 00:00:54.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
make these cells perfectly suited

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:59.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deliver oxygen
precisely where and when it’s needed.

00:00:59.178 --> 00:01:01.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one is a tiny disk

00:01:01.347 --> 00:01:04.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its center curved inward on both sides.

00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:08.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
This shape lets the cells bend
and fold themselves

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can squeeze
through even the narrowest blood vessels.

00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:15.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Red blood cells are unusual in other ways.

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:17.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t have a nucleus

00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:21.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the specialized structures
that other cells need to survive.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this reason,

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:27.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
red blood cells don’t use up
any of the oxygen they transport.

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:29.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
And their unique makeup

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:33.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaves more room
for their most important component

00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:35.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hemoglobin.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each red blood cell contains

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:41.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 250 million hemoglobin molecules.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:44.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hemoglobin molecules work like tiny machines

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
absorbing as much oxygen as possible

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:49.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
when red blood cells pass through the lungs.

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:53.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each hemoglobin molecule has four locations

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:56.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
where an oxygen molecule can attach.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:00.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
As soon as an oxygen molecule binds
to one of those locations,

00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:03.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
something remarkable happens:

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:07.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tightly folded structure
of the hemoglobin changes,

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:11.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
making it possible
for as many as three more oxygen molecules

00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:14.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be absorbed.

00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:16.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does the hemoglobin

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:19.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
know when and where
to deliver the oxygen?

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:22.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a part of the body is exerted,

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:24.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
it uses more oxygen.

00:02:25.828 --> 00:02:28.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as blood travels through your body,

00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:31.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
it passes by tissues that need oxygen

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:33.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that release carbon dioxide

00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:35.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
as waste into the blood.

00:02:35.632 --> 00:02:37.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the presence of carbon dioxide,

00:02:37.927 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
hemoglobin’s bond to oxygen changes.

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:44.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
The oxygen molecules
that have been riding along

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:47.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
can then break free
to be absorbed by other body cells.

00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:51.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for the carbon dioxide
that needs to be removed,

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:53.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of it is chemically changed

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and carried by the blood’s plasma.

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:58.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some also attaches
to the hemoglobin molecules

00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:00.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
and returns to the lungs,

00:03:00.872 --> 00:03:05.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
where, along with the carbon dioxide
unloaded from plasma,

00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:07.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can be exhaled

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:09.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where the very next breath

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:11.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
brings in a fresh supply of oxygen

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
ready for transport.

00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Constantly zipping through
your body’s thousands of miles of blood vessels,

00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:23.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
red blood cells wear out
after only about four months.

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:26.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
But healthy bone marrow continuously produces

00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:31.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
up to two million new red blood cells
every second as replacement cells.

00:03:32.704 --> 00:03:35.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the liver breaks down the worn-out cells

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:39.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
and recycles the iron
found in the hemoglobin molecules.

00:03:41.798 --> 00:03:44.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an amazing system

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
of delivery, pickup, and disposal.

00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:50.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:53.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the oxygen transport system
in our bodies,

00:03:53.813 --> 00:03:56.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its trillions of red blood cells,
simply evolve?

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:00.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or was it designed?
