00:00:09 We are naturally drawn to it.
00:00:15 Whether it is epic
00:00:18 or subtle,
00:00:20 artistic beauty captivates us.
00:00:24 Sometimes it astonishes us in unexpected places.
00:00:29 For example, sea slugs
00:00:32 sport bold colors that may ward off potential predators.
00:00:37 But to us, these colors form artistic arrangements
00:00:41 of stunning beauty.
00:00:49 Chameleons are known for their ability to alter their coloring
00:00:53 —sometimes to blend in,
00:00:56 sometimes to warn,
00:00:57 but at other times to attract the eyes
00:01:00 of a potential mate.
00:01:07 Some unrelated animals
00:01:09 seem to have gone to the same artistic school,
00:01:12 as in the case of the peacock spider
00:01:15 and its namesake.
00:01:25 Unlike a static painting,
00:01:27 many animals use motion
00:01:29 to extend their arrangements of color,
00:01:32 texture, and form.
00:01:36 Few birds can match the flamboyance of male birds of paradise.
00:01:42 Mating pairs of western grebes take artistic performance a step further.
00:01:47 They put on intricately timed and precisely executed dances
00:01:56 —the ultimate water ballet.
00:02:06 Male bowerbirds show an almost artistic sensibility
00:02:10 by arranging material
00:02:12 from their environment in a manner we happen to find
00:02:16 aesthetically appealing.
00:02:33 Another animal that displays what resembles a creative impulse
00:02:38 assembles an exhibition
00:02:41 of immense scale when compared to its size.
00:02:47 The white-spotted pufferfish
00:02:48 sculpts an intricate pattern on the seafloor sand
00:02:53 that we find beautiful.
00:03:04 The male that labors on this underwater installation
00:03:07 hopes a female will take note
00:03:09 and approve.
00:03:14 What do you think?
00:03:17 Did the artistry we see in animals
00:03:19 simply evolve?
00:03:22 Or was it designed?
