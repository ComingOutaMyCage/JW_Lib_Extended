00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:11.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are naturally drawn to it.

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:18.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether it is epic

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
or subtle,

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:24.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
artistic beauty captivates us.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes it astonishes us
in unexpected places.

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:32.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, sea slugs

00:00:32.184 --> 00:00:36.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
sport bold colors
that may ward off potential predators.

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:41.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to us, these colors
form artistic arrangements

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:43.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
of stunning beauty.

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:52.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chameleons are known
for their ability to alter their coloring

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:55.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
—sometimes to blend in,

00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:57.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes to warn,

00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
but at other times
to attract the eyes

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:02.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a potential mate.

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:09.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some unrelated animals

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
seem to have gone
to the same artistic school,

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:15.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
as in the case of the peacock spider

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:17.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its namesake.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike a static painting,

00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:29.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
many animals use motion

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:32.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
to extend their arrangements of color,

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:34.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
texture, and form.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Few birds can match the flamboyance
of male birds of paradise.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mating pairs of western grebes
take artistic performance a step further.

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:52.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
They put on intricately timed
and precisely executed dances

00:01:56.412 --> 00:01:59.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the ultimate water ballet.

00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:10.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Male bowerbirds
show an almost artistic sensibility

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:12.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
by arranging material

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:16.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their environment
in a manner we happen to find

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
aesthetically appealing.

00:02:33.957 --> 00:02:38.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another animal that displays
what resembles a creative impulse

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:41.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
assembles an exhibition

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
of immense scale
when compared to its size.

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:48.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
The white-spotted pufferfish

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:51.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
sculpts an intricate pattern
on the seafloor sand

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we find beautiful.

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:07.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
The male that labors
on this underwater installation

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
hopes a female will take note

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
and approve.

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:16.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the artistry we see in animals

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
simply evolve?

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:24.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or was it designed?
