News overnight

00:00:01.856 --> 00:00:03.691 line:10% position:50% align:center
—Steelers’ linebacker Jason Worilds

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
is walking away from the NFL

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:07.945 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the prime of his NFL career.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:10.364 line:10% position:50% align:center
Worilds is or has been with the Steelers

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:13.200 line:10% position:50% align:center
for five seasons and started in all 16 games.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s just walking away
from tens of millions of dollars.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is he going to do
for the rest of his life?

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
No clue, but it better be worth it.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Jason Worilds,

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:25.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom is a beautiful woman.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was in her early 20’s

00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she was introduced to the Witnesses,

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she started a study,
and six months later

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was baptized.

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my mom put the truth before us growing up,

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t see the true value
of what it was that I had.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:45.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know how true the truth was.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s vital that you set spiritual goals.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t, the reality is
that someone is going to set a goal for you,

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:56.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think that’s what was true in my case.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started playing American football

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:01.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
my freshman year of high school.

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:03.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of my coaches sat me down and said,

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:08.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You can potentially go to college
on a full scholarship.”

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:12.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did everything to succeed at football,

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so the dedication—it escalates.

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
I studied the Bible for several years,

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:23.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by the time
that I started to make progress in my study,

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was being courted by the NFL.

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:31.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was whole-souled to football.

00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I pursued

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
my professional career.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:41.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was drafted, it was what I
had been working toward for so many years.

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
That first year, it was chaotic,
but then in my second year,

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got to a point in my life
where everything was unstable.

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:52.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that the things
that I was pursuing were fruitless.

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just felt hollow inside, right?

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:58.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like if you shook me, I would rattle.

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:03.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw those who had more money,
more success,

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:05.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they weren’t happy.

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:08.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was one of the motivating factors
for me to say: ‘You know what?

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:10.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘There has to be something more.

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘There has to be,
because I’m at the precipice

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘of what I’ve always wanted,

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:18.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and the only thing that I can see

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:21.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more angst,
more headache, more strife.’

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was nothing there
that was going to bring lasting happiness,

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:29.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think that is what motivated me
to want to see what’s in this Bible.

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:34.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I reached out, and I picked up a study
with a local brother there in Pittsburgh.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:40.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a time, I felt like:
‘Man, I can do both of these.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got my craft here, and I’m enjoying it,
and then I have Jehovah.’

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:49.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a defender in football,
there are certain things that you dream of.

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:53.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
During one game,
I had one of those opportunities,

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t put everything into it

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way that I always dreamed
of myself doing.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:01.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
I let up.

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:06.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
The person that I was on the inside
was changing.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
That night

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sat thinking:

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:12.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’re not in the environment
that’s conducive to you

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:14.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘continuing to grow as a spiritual person.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might need to make some changes.’

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that night is when I realized:
‘Hey, you know what?

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:25.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yeah, I don’t need this.

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are you here?
What are you doing?’

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reality is that I loved playing football.

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:35.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
I enjoyed it,
but it didn’t bring true happiness.

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:41.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
I retired at a time when I was going
to take the next step with my career.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the offers that were on the table were

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
tens of millions of dollars,

00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that wasn’t what I wanted to do.

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
So once I let them know that,
then the offers increased.

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:55.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that wasn’t what I wanted.

00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:57.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to make the truth my own

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:00.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
and get into the full-time ministry.

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was baptized September 13, 2015.

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:08.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
That day was so special

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:11.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah completely welcomed me
into his spiritual family.

00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:13.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve become a better friend.

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:15.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve become a better brother.

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:17.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve become a better son.

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:22.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are nothing but wins
when you serve Jehovah.

00:04:23.742 --> 00:04:26.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
The joy, the happiness,
that I receive now

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:28.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why I just rejoice
to be out in the ministry

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:33.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because you have an opportunity
to actually affect change in someone’s life

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make them a better person
and give them purpose

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have them have
this same warm relationship with Jehovah

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:43.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s unparalleled.

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:46.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the fact.

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more that we center
our lives around Jehovah,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
the happier we will be.

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:55.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where my happiness comes from.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Brother Worilds said,

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:04.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more we center our life on Jehovah,

00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:07.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
the happier we will be.

00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:11.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
To many, it seemed he gave up so much

00:05:11.874 --> 00:05:16.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
—fame, wealth, and professional recognition.

00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:18.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in reality,

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:22.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
he discovered what was truly valuable:

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
the good news of truth.

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:30.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder he was determined
to make it his life’s work.

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:33.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy that Jason has been serving

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:37.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a member
of the United States Bethel family

00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
since 2017.
