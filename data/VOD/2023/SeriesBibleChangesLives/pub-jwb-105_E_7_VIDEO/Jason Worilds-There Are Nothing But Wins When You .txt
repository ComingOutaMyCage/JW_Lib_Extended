00:00:00 News overnight
00:00:01 —Steelers’ linebacker Jason Worilds
00:00:03 is walking away from the NFL
00:00:05 in the prime of his NFL career.
00:00:07 Worilds is or has been with the Steelers
00:00:10 for five seasons and started in all 16 games.
00:00:13 He’s just walking away from tens of millions of dollars.
00:00:16 What is he going to do for the rest of his life?
00:00:18 No clue, but it better be worth it.
00:00:20 My name is Jason Worilds,
00:00:23 and I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:26 My mom is a beautiful woman.
00:00:29 It was in her early 20’s
00:00:31 that she was introduced to the Witnesses,
00:00:33 and she started a study, and six months later
00:00:35 she was baptized.
00:00:37 So my mom put the truth before us growing up,
00:00:40 but I didn’t see the true value of what it was that I had.
00:00:42 I didn’t know how true the truth was.
00:00:46 It’s vital that you set spiritual goals.
00:00:49 If you don’t, the reality is that someone is going to set a goal for you,
00:00:54 and I think that’s what was true in my case.
00:00:57 I started playing American football
00:00:59 my freshman year of high school.
00:01:01 One of my coaches sat me down and said,
00:01:03 “You can potentially go to college on a full scholarship.”
00:01:08 I did everything to succeed at football,
00:01:12 and so the dedication—it escalates.
00:01:18 I studied the Bible for several years,
00:01:20 but by the time that I started to make progress in my study,
00:01:23 I was being courted by the NFL.
00:01:27 I was whole-souled to football.
00:01:32 And so I pursued
00:01:35 my professional career.
00:01:37 When I was drafted, it was what I had been working toward for so many years.
00:01:42 That first year, it was chaotic, but then in my second year,
00:01:45 I got to a point in my life where everything was unstable.
00:01:47 I felt that the things that I was pursuing were fruitless.
00:01:52 I just felt hollow inside, right?
00:01:54 I felt like if you shook me, I would rattle.
00:01:59 I saw those who had more money, more success,
00:02:03 and they weren’t happy.
00:02:05 That was one of the motivating factors for me to say: ‘You know what?
00:02:08 ‘There has to be something more.
00:02:10 ‘There has to be, because I’m at the precipice
00:02:13 ‘of what I’ve always wanted,
00:02:15 ‘and the only thing that I can see
00:02:18 is more angst, more headache, more strife.’
00:02:21 There was nothing there that was going to bring lasting happiness,
00:02:24 and I think that is what motivated me to want to see what’s in this Bible.
00:02:30 And so I reached out, and I picked up a study with a local brother there in Pittsburgh.
00:02:35 For a time, I felt like: ‘Man, I can do both of these.
00:02:40 I’ve got my craft here, and I’m enjoying it, and then I have Jehovah.’
00:02:45 As a defender in football, there are certain things that you dream of.
00:02:50 During one game, I had one of those opportunities,
00:02:54 but I didn’t put everything into it
00:02:56 the way that I always dreamed of myself doing.
00:02:59 I let up.
00:03:02 The person that I was on the inside was changing.
00:03:06 That night
00:03:08 I sat thinking:
00:03:10 ‘You’re not in the environment that’s conducive to you
00:03:12 ‘continuing to grow as a spiritual person.
00:03:14 You might need to make some changes.’
00:03:16 And that night is when I realized: ‘Hey, you know what?
00:03:21 ‘Yeah, I don’t need this.
00:03:26 Why are you here? What are you doing?’
00:03:29 The reality is that I loved playing football.
00:03:31 I enjoyed it, but it didn’t bring true happiness.
00:03:37 I retired at a time when I was going to take the next step with my career.
00:03:41 And so the offers that were on the table were
00:03:45 tens of millions of dollars,
00:03:47 and that wasn’t what I wanted to do.
00:03:49 So once I let them know that, then the offers increased.
00:03:53 But that wasn’t what I wanted.
00:03:55 I wanted to make the truth my own
00:03:58 and get into the full-time ministry.
00:04:02 I was baptized September 13, 2015.
00:04:06 That day was so special
00:04:08 because Jehovah completely welcomed me into his spiritual family.
00:04:12 I’ve become a better friend.
00:04:13 I’ve become a better brother.
00:04:15 I’ve become a better son.
00:04:19 There are nothing but wins when you serve Jehovah.
00:04:23 The joy, the happiness, that I receive now
00:04:26 and why I just rejoice to be out in the ministry
00:04:28 is because you have an opportunity to actually affect change in someone’s life
00:04:33 and make them a better person and give them purpose
00:04:36 and have them have this same warm relationship with Jehovah
00:04:41 that you have.
00:04:43 It’s unparalleled.
00:04:45 That’s the fact.
00:04:46 The more that we center our lives around Jehovah,
00:04:49 the happier we will be.
00:04:53 That’s where my happiness comes from.
00:04:59 As Brother Worilds said,
00:05:01 the more we center our life on Jehovah,
00:05:04 the happier we will be.
00:05:07 To many, it seemed he gave up so much
00:05:11 —fame, wealth, and professional recognition.
00:05:16 But in reality,
00:05:18 he discovered what was truly valuable:
00:05:22 the good news of truth.
00:05:25 No wonder he was determined to make it his life’s work.
00:05:30 We are happy that Jason has been serving
00:05:33 as a member of the United States Bethel family
00:05:37 since 2017.
