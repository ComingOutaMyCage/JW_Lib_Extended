If Mom and Dad were alive,

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would be very proud of you.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what I’m thinking?

00:00:15.668 --> 00:00:17.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could have more.

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:20.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m talking about real security

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:22.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you and the family

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a government carpentry contract.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Radio 93.6:

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
As an update to our report from yesterday,

00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:34.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
militia groups are threatening

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:36.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take over the capital.

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:39.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Violence has been escalating in the area.

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:41.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you are aware,

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:43.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch has recommended that we meet

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:44.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
and discuss the possibility

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:46.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
of civil unrest in our area.

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:48.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will always be rumors

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:50.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
surrounding the elections.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:53.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
The safety of the congregation is the concern.

00:00:57.478 --> 00:00:59.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no need to worry.

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:03.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are just threats, rumors.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing to it.

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:09.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received direction from the branch.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those brothers are so far away though.

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:14.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
I keep wondering

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they are being overly cautious.

00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:20.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Amani:

00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:23.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your strength

00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:27.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be in keeping calm

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:29.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showing trust.”

00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:31.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wake up!

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wake up!

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you still trusting these people to guide your life?

00:01:38.328 --> 00:01:40.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Father Jehovah,

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:42.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
please help me.
