00:00:10 Hello, who is it?
00:00:12 Hey, hi. How are you?
00:00:14 OK, come on up.
00:00:15 My name is Enrique Torres, Jr.
00:00:18 I live on Staten Island, New York,
00:00:21 and I have the privilege to serve in the Mid-Island Congregation.
00:00:38 The first 40 years of my life were mired
00:00:43 in a lifestyle that was horrendous.
00:00:47 A judge stated that I had
00:00:49 a “propensity for criminality.”
00:00:54 No doubt, he was describing a vicious person.
00:01:04 As a youth, I was hanging around with the wrong kind of people
00:01:08 that led me into a life of crime
00:01:11 and debauchery.
00:01:14 This captain in our prison came up
00:01:17 with a psychological plan
00:01:19 to take the individuals that had the potential for leadership
00:01:24 and put them in isolation.
00:01:26 I wound up to be among them.
00:01:30 Can you imagine, they were getting beat up?
00:01:35 It was becoming too much for me —the screams and so forth.
00:01:39 I said, “If this continues, I’m not going to survive here.”
00:01:47 I did get in contact with my father
00:01:49 and he told me:
00:01:51 “Never forget Jehovah.
00:01:53 That is his name.”
00:01:57 And that’s all I got out of it.
00:02:00 I knew that there was nobody that could help me but God.
00:02:04 So that’s when I found myself in prayer to Jehovah.
00:02:09 I vowed that I would make it my business to learn more about him
00:02:12 than just his name.
00:02:14 At that time, that’s all I knew.
00:02:16 I got some literature; I got the Bible too.
00:02:20 Jehovah became more meaningful to me.
00:02:24 That’s when he became real to me.
00:02:28 That was the first 40 years of my life.
00:02:31 But the last 40 years of my life
00:02:34 with Jehovah’s training from his organization,
00:02:37 my personality—it was transformed.
00:02:42 The blessings that I have received
00:02:44 have been in the area of my field service
00:02:47 and also my teaching ability,
00:02:49 which has helped me to be able to draw closer to Jehovah.
00:02:55 I was privileged to become a ministerial servant for many years
00:03:00 and a field service overseer for many more years.
00:03:05 One of the main challenges that I’m facing is
00:03:10 that I have developed cancer
00:03:14 and have gone through four cancer operations
00:03:17 and also some chemotherapy.
00:03:20 Without relying upon Jehovah to help me
00:03:23 to overcome these challenges,
00:03:27 there’s no doubt in my mind that I never would have been able to make it.
00:03:33 I would recommend to avoid that trap that I fell into
00:03:37 —hanging around with street gangs
00:03:41 and then getting involved in burglaries and robberies.
00:03:46 It’s a progression.
00:03:48 It was not anything of value at all.
00:03:52 Instead, what it brought me was a lot of grief,
00:03:56 mental scars, and also a lot of trouble with my conscience.
00:04:03 Study God’s Word, the Bible, so that you may be able
00:04:06 to see what Jehovah has in store for the future.
00:04:10 And also, you’ll be able to see that he’s a kind, merciful, loving God
00:04:15 that doesn’t want anyone to be destroyed but wants them to have life.
00:04:21 Parents, never give up on your children.
00:04:24 Jehovah never gave up on me.
00:04:29 He rescued me from this spiritual darkness that I was in,
00:04:34 and he brought me into his light
00:04:37 and to his wonderful organization.
00:04:40 And I give him all the credit for that.
00:04:44 And when I speak to people, that’s what I tell them.
00:04:47 I tell them: “It wasn’t me.
00:04:49 “It was Jehovah that has done all of this,
00:04:52 and he could do that for you too if you give him an opportunity.”
