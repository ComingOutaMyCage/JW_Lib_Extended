Hello, who is it?

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:14.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, hi. How are you?

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, come on up.

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:18.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Enrique Torres, Jr.

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:21.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
I live on Staten Island, New York,

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have the privilege to serve
in the Mid-Island Congregation.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first 40 years of my life were mired

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a lifestyle that was horrendous.

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
A judge stated that I had

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
a “propensity for criminality.”

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt, he was describing a vicious person.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a youth, I was hanging around
with the wrong kind of people

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:11.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led me into a life of crime

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:13.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and debauchery.

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:17.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
This captain in our prison came up

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:19.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a psychological plan

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the individuals
that had the potential for leadership

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:26.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put them in isolation.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wound up to be among them.

00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine, they were getting beat up?

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was becoming too much for me
—the screams and so forth.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “If this continues,
I’m not going to survive here.”

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:49.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did get in contact with my father

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he told me:

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:53.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Never forget Jehovah.

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is his name.”

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s all I got out of it.

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:04.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that there was nobody
that could help me but God.

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:08.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s when I found myself
in prayer to Jehovah.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
I vowed that I would make it my business
to learn more about him

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:14.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just his name.

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:16.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, that’s all I knew.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:20.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got some literature; I got the Bible too.

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah became more meaningful to me.

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when he became real to me.

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:31.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the first 40 years of my life.

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:34.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the last 40 years of my life

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s training
from his organization,

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:42.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
my personality—it was transformed.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings that I have received

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been in the area of my field service

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:49.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also my teaching ability,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
which has helped me
to be able to draw closer to Jehovah.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:03:00.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was privileged to become
a ministerial servant for many years

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:03.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a field service overseer
for many more years.

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the main challenges that I’m facing is

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:14.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I have developed cancer

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:17.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have gone through four cancer operations

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also some chemotherapy.

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:23.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without relying upon Jehovah to help me

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
to overcome these challenges,

00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:31.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no doubt in my mind that I
never would have been able to make it.

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:37.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would recommend to avoid
that trap that I fell into

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:41.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hanging around with street gangs

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:46.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then getting involved
in burglaries and robberies.

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a progression.

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not anything of value at all.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:56.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, what it brought me
was a lot of grief,

00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:00.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
mental scars, and also
a lot of trouble with my conscience.

00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:06.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Study God’s Word, the Bible,
so that you may be able

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:10.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see what Jehovah has in store
for the future.

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:15.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also, you’ll be able to see
that he’s a kind, merciful, loving God

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:20.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
that doesn’t want anyone to be destroyed
but wants them to have life.

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:24.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, never give up on your children.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:27.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never gave up on me.

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rescued me from this spiritual darkness
that I was in,

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:37.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he brought me into his light

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:40.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to his wonderful organization.

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:44.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I give him all the credit for that.

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I speak to people,
that’s what I tell them.

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:49.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tell them: “It wasn’t me.

00:04:49.518 --> 00:04:52.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was Jehovah that has done all of this,

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:56.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he could do that for you too
if you give him an opportunity.”
