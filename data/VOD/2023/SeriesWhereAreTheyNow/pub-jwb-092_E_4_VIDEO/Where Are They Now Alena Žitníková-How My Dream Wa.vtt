00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:04.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 20 years ago,

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:07.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Awake!</i>  magazine published the life story

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:10.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Alena Žitníková.

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:13.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alena realized that pleasing Jehovah

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:16.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
would mean rejection by this world.

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:20.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the following episode
of <i>Where Are They Now?</i>

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
note what she describes
as perhaps an even bigger test.

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Alena Žitníková,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was born into a family
of a zealous Communist.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
We believed that a world was coming

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
where people
would have everything they needed.

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:42.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’d be happy,

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there would be peace worldwide,

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:47.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I deeply believed it.

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:53.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I found paradise among God’s people.

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:04.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I grew up, I realized that Communism

00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
had its deficits because I saw its hypocrisy.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
People didn’t practice what they preached.

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:17.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
In high school, I met a friend

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
who started talking about God and the Bible.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:26.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the fact that God’s name is Jehovah

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that something called God’s Kingdom

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Armageddon will come

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:36.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those were all new concepts for me.

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:40.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d never heard of these things before.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d never even held a Bible in my hand.

00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:50.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Bible study gradually helped me gain faith.

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:56.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1983, I was baptized in a bathtub.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:02:00.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time,
Jehovah’s Witnesses were under ban.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:05.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1989, the Velvet Revolution

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:07.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
took place in Czechoslovakia.

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
That also meant a change
for Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:17.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we could begin
to express our faith publicly.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
The house-to-house ministry started,

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:24.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was something
amazing and new for me.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got to know Petr in our local congregation,

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we got married in 1990.

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:36.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
We entered into full-time service

00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:38.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
two years after the wedding.

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:42.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
We first started serving as regular pioneers,

00:02:42.512 --> 00:02:46.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two years later
we were invited to Bethel.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:50.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were years full of joy

00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:53.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and full of hard work,

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
which greatly enriched me.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
We left Bethel eight years later,

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I found that people had changed.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was a challenge for us

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
because now people
had become more materialistic.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:19.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I learned the truth, it seemed to me
that Armageddon was at the door

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that it would come soon.

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:26.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the world helped us in a way
because it didn’t want us;

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
it didn’t want Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
But today’s world,

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its freedom,

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:36.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t tell us that it doesn’t want us.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it wants us.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wants our time, it wants our attention,

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:48.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and therefore there may be a great danger.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:53.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could feel that Armageddon is delaying.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:57.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we might feel the need
to fulfill our dreams already today.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:02.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah teaches me to be patient.

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:06.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is a happy God,

00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:08.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even when he waits,
he does not wait idly.

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:12.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is hardworking;

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s always doing something.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:21.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you fill the waiting with activity,
time goes faster.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
The field ministry is very important to me.

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:29.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes it costs a little effort,

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my service partners
are always a great encouragement to me.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have nice conversations in service.

00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:43.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even today, we find people
who think about the meaning of life.

00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:50.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Service does not only consist
of house-to-house service;

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
service is the whole Christian way of life,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
including caring for brothers and sisters.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think serving my brothers and sisters

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires us to set aside time for them.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way, I can promote
a good atmosphere in the congregation.

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:16.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be in a spiritual paradise,
I must contribute something.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, the spiritual paradise
will be bigger,

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
deeper, and more beautiful!

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do something for others,

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:34.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t think too much
about ourselves—our pain.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think life in Jehovah’s service

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:44.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
is sometimes challenging,

00:05:46.362 --> 00:05:49.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the result is happiness.

00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:53.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
And already today,

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:58.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that my dream of a happy life

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:00.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
has come true.

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:16.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re encouraged
to see Sister Alena Žitníková

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:18.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and her husband, Petr,

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
remain busy in Kingdom service.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:24.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful that this has helped them

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have realistic expectations

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:30.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue to remain joyful!

00:06:31.207 --> 00:06:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a world that wants our time and energy,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alena maintains her focus
by sharing her Christian hope,

00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:40.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
caring for her brothers and sisters,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
and doing her all to encourage others.
