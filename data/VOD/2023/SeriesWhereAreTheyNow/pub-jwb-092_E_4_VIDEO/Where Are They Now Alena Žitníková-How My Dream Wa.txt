00:00:02 More than 20 years ago,
00:00:04 Awake!  magazine published the life story
00:00:07 of Alena Žitníková.
00:00:10 Alena realized that pleasing Jehovah
00:00:13 would mean rejection by this world.
00:00:16 But in the following episode of Where Are They Now?
00:00:20 note what she describes as perhaps an even bigger test.
00:00:27 My name is Alena Žitníková,
00:00:30 and I was born into a family of a zealous Communist.
00:00:34 We believed that a world was coming
00:00:37 where people would have everything they needed.
00:00:40 They’d be happy,
00:00:42 and there would be peace worldwide,
00:00:44 and I deeply believed it.
00:00:49 But I found paradise among God’s people.
00:01:00 As I grew up, I realized that Communism
00:01:04 had its deficits because I saw its hypocrisy.
00:01:10 People didn’t practice what they preached.
00:01:15 In high school, I met a friend
00:01:17 who started talking about God and the Bible.
00:01:21 So the fact that God’s name is Jehovah
00:01:28 and that something called God’s Kingdom
00:01:30 and Armageddon will come
00:01:33 —those were all new concepts for me.
00:01:38 I’d never heard of these things before.
00:01:41 I’d never even held a Bible in my hand.
00:01:46 A Bible study gradually helped me gain faith.
00:01:53 In 1983, I was baptized in a bathtub.
00:01:56 At that time, Jehovah’s Witnesses were under ban.
00:02:01 In 1989, the Velvet Revolution
00:02:05 took place in Czechoslovakia.
00:02:08 That also meant a change for Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:02:13 because we could begin to express our faith publicly.
00:02:19 The house-to-house ministry started,
00:02:21 and it was something amazing and new for me.
00:02:26 I got to know Petr in our local congregation,
00:02:29 and we got married in 1990.
00:02:33 We entered into full-time service
00:02:36 two years after the wedding.
00:02:38 We first started serving as regular pioneers,
00:02:42 and two years later we were invited to Bethel.
00:02:47 Those were years full of joy
00:02:50 and full of hard work,
00:02:53 which greatly enriched me.
00:02:57 We left Bethel eight years later,
00:03:00 and I found that people had changed.
00:03:06 And it was a challenge for us
00:03:09 because now people had become more materialistic.
00:03:15 When I learned the truth, it seemed to me that Armageddon was at the door
00:03:19 —that it would come soon.
00:03:22 And the world helped us in a way because it didn’t want us;
00:03:26 it didn’t want Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:29 But today’s world,
00:03:31 with its freedom,
00:03:33 doesn’t tell us that it doesn’t want us.
00:03:36 In fact, it wants us.
00:03:39 It wants our time, it wants our attention,
00:03:44 and therefore there may be a great danger.
00:03:49 We could feel that Armageddon is delaying.
00:03:53 So we might feel the need to fulfill our dreams already today.
00:03:58 Jehovah teaches me to be patient.
00:04:03 Jehovah is a happy God,
00:04:06 and even when he waits, he does not wait idly.
00:04:08 Jehovah is hardworking;
00:04:12 he’s always doing something.
00:04:16 When you fill the waiting with activity, time goes faster.
00:04:22 The field ministry is very important to me.
00:04:26 Sometimes it costs a little effort,
00:04:29 but my service partners are always a great encouragement to me.
00:04:33 With Jehovah’s help,
00:04:36 we have nice conversations in service.
00:04:38 And even today, we find people who think about the meaning of life.
00:04:45 Service does not only consist of house-to-house service;
00:04:50 service is the whole Christian way of life,
00:04:53 including caring for brothers and sisters.
00:04:57 I think serving my brothers and sisters
00:05:01 requires us to set aside time for them.
00:05:06 In this way, I can promote a good atmosphere in the congregation.
00:05:12 To be in a spiritual paradise, I must contribute something.
00:05:18 As a result, the spiritual paradise will be bigger,
00:05:22 deeper, and more beautiful!
00:05:27 When we do something for others,
00:05:30 we don’t think too much about ourselves—our pain.
00:05:35 I think life in Jehovah’s service
00:05:40 is sometimes challenging,
00:05:46 but the result is happiness.
00:05:51 And already today,
00:05:53 I can say that my dream of a happy life
00:05:58 has come true.
00:06:13 We’re encouraged to see Sister Alena Žitníková
00:06:16 and her husband, Petr,
00:06:18 remain busy in Kingdom service.
00:06:21 How wonderful that this has helped them
00:06:24 to have realistic expectations
00:06:27 and continue to remain joyful!
00:06:31 In a world that wants our time and energy,
00:06:34 Alena maintains her focus by sharing her Christian hope,
00:06:38 caring for her brothers and sisters,
00:06:40 and doing her all to encourage others.
