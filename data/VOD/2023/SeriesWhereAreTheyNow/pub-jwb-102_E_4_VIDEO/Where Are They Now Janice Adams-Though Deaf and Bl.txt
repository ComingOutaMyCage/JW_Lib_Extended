00:00:03 I was born deaf, and I attended a school for the deaf.
00:00:08 Later, I attended college.
00:00:12 While I was there,
00:00:14 I noticed that my vision was deteriorating, and I couldn’t understand why.
00:00:19 I was informed that I was going blind.
00:00:21 I was stunned.
00:00:24 I was also given an article,
00:00:26 and in the article, I noticed one sentence that said:
00:00:31 “[Deaf-blind people] are the loneliest people in the world.”
00:00:37 I was devastated.
00:00:42 Being both deaf and blind is challenging.
00:00:47 I’ve had to learn how to live independently.
00:00:52 But the most important thing that I’ve learned
00:00:56 is learning about Jehovah—the true God.
00:01:07 Some people might imagine
00:01:09 that a deaf-blind person would be too limited to serve Jehovah fully.
00:01:14 That’s far from the truth.
00:01:16 Let me give you some examples of my service.
00:01:19 Some of the ways that I support the congregation
00:01:23 are by attending meetings
00:01:26 and being regular in service.
00:01:29 Sometimes I can be helpful
00:01:31 in training others how to be more effective teachers.
00:01:35 I often join others on their Bible studies.
00:01:39 I’ve been able to pioneer for many years,
00:01:42 and this is something that I really enjoy.
00:01:47 Over the years,
00:01:49 my husband and I have had the opportunity to preach in many countries.
00:01:54 In some of the countries, the deaf ministry was just getting started.
00:01:59 For example, we went to Honduras in Central America.
00:02:04 They only had two small groups.
00:02:07 We first went for a few months,
00:02:10 then returned and stayed for a year.
00:02:12 What a great experience to participate and see the growth in the field!
00:02:19 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:02:22 I was accustomed to being a self-sufficient person.
00:02:25 For example, I could go out on my own with my guide dog.
00:02:30 We could go to the Kingdom Hall to meet the brothers and sisters.
00:02:35 But then COVID-19 hit, and I was
00:02:39 stuck at home—isolated.
00:02:45 While it’s true that we still had meetings
00:02:48 and service arrangements on Zoom, it wasn’t easy.
00:02:54 The only person who could interpret for me
00:02:57 was my husband, no one else.
00:03:01 It was tough.
00:03:03 He was exhausted.
00:03:05 We both were.
00:03:07 It was something we had to endure.
00:03:11 In time, when it became safe enough,
00:03:15 a few of the brothers and sisters volunteered to come and help interpret.
00:03:21 That really built me up.
00:03:23 I could finally have direct contact with my friends.
00:03:29 I was thrilled.
00:03:31 I also receive a lot of support from the congregation.
00:03:35 There are many willing volunteers to tactile interpret for me at the meetings.
00:03:40 That gives me joy.
00:03:42 I always know
00:03:44 that if I have a problem, I can share my thoughts and feelings with others.
00:03:49 They will listen and support me.
00:03:54 No matter what the future brings,
00:03:57 I remember the scripture at Isaiah 41:10.
00:04:02 It says:
00:04:04 “Do not be afraid, for I am with you.”
00:04:08 I know that Jehovah encourages me.
00:04:12 He will help me.
00:04:14 I don’t have to worry.
00:04:20 While it’s true that I’m deaf and blind, I’m not
00:04:24 one of “the loneliest people in the world.”
00:04:28 I’m a happy person because I have many friends,
00:04:32 I have the joy of helping others to learn about God,
00:04:37 and I have the best Friend ever
00:04:40 —Jehovah.
