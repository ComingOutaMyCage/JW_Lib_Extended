00:00:03.023 --> 00:00:07.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was born deaf,
and I attended a school for the deaf.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, I attended college.

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:14.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
While I was there,

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that my vision was deteriorating,
and I couldn’t understand why.

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was informed that I was going blind.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was stunned.

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was also given an article,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the article,
I noticed one sentence that said: 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Deaf-blind people] are the loneliest people
in the world.”

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was devastated.

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being both deaf and blind is challenging.

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve had to learn how to live independently.

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:56.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the most important thing
that I’ve learned

00:00:56.076 --> 00:01:00.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
is learning about Jehovah—the true God.

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might imagine

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a deaf-blind person would be too limited
to serve Jehovah fully.

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s far from the truth.

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me give you some examples of my service.

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:23.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the ways
that I support the congregation

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:26.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
are by attending meetings

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being regular in service.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I can be helpful

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:35.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
in training others how
to be more effective teachers.

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:39.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
I often join others on their Bible studies.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been able to pioneer for many years,

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is something that I really enjoy.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:49.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the years, 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
my husband and I have had the opportunity
to preach in many countries.

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some of the countries,
the deaf ministry was just getting started.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we went to Honduras in Central America.

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:07.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
They only had two small groups.

00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:10.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
We first went for a few months,

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
then returned and stayed for a year.

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:17.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great experience to participate
and see the growth in the field!

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:25.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was accustomed
to being a self-sufficient person.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:30.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, I could go out on my own
with my guide dog.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could go to the Kingdom Hall
to meet the brothers and sisters.

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then COVID-19 hit, and I was 

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:43.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
stuck at home—isolated.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it’s true that we still had meetings

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:52.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
and service arrangements on Zoom,
it wasn’t easy.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only person who could interpret for me

00:02:57.156 --> 00:03:01.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
was my husband, no one else.

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was tough.

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was exhausted.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
We both were.

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was something we had to endure.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, when it became safe enough,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:20.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few of the brothers and sisters volunteered
to come and help interpret.

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:23.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really built me up.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:27.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could finally have direct contact
with my friends.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:30.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was thrilled.

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:35.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also receive a lot of support
from the congregation.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many willing volunteers
to tactile interpret for me at the meetings.

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
That gives me joy.

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always know

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:49.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if I have a problem, I can share
my thoughts and feelings with others.

00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:51.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will listen and support me.

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what the future brings,

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember the scripture at Isaiah 41:10.

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:04.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.”

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:12.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that Jehovah encourages me.

00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:14.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will help me.

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:16.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t have to worry.

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:24.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it’s true
that I’m deaf and blind, I’m not

00:04:24.868 --> 00:04:28.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of “the loneliest people in the world.”

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:31.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a happy person
because I have many friends,

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:37.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have the joy of helping others
to learn about God,

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:40.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have the best Friend ever

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah.
