00:00:09 I went to a vocational school
00:00:10 where I was able to fast-track
00:00:12 learning a trade.
00:00:13 Unexpectedly, I finished at the top of my class.
00:00:16 After that, my teachers and my classmates
00:00:18 started to expect a lot more from me.
00:00:21 They were saying: “You’re doing so well.
00:00:23 “You represent the school.
00:00:25 “You will have to work hard.
00:00:27 “You’ll do great things.
00:00:28 You’ll go far.”
00:00:29 They were constantly putting pressure on me
00:00:31 to go for higher education and to go to university.
00:00:35 There was this girl
00:00:36 in high school who was my age.
00:00:38 She was very friendly.
00:00:40 She always paid attention to me; she was a nice person.
00:00:43 I also thought she was cute.
00:00:46 My classmates were like: “Go, talk to her!”
00:00:49 or “Hey, Isaac, do you know that she likes you?”
00:00:54 And so I wasn’t sure what to do.
00:00:56 Of course, when I chose to go to that school,
00:00:59 higher education wasn’t the reason.
00:01:01 I wanted to fast-track getting a trade
00:01:03 and starting a job so that I could earn my income.
00:01:06 That’s what I thought.
00:01:08 It was a really difficult time for me.
00:01:11 I remember praying to Jehovah in tears for hours.
00:01:16 I didn’t ask for advice,
00:01:19 didn’t talk to friends or people I trusted about it,
00:01:21 not even my parents.
00:01:25 And little by little, I started to give in
00:01:27 to that pressure that I got because of this girl.
00:01:31 In the end, we started to flirt with each other.
00:01:34 We chatted and sent each other messages.
00:01:40 When I prayed to Jehovah,
00:01:42 I didn’t feel completely comfortable.
00:01:44 I thought, ‘If I’m not doing what Jehovah is asking of me,
00:01:48 ‘if I’m not behaving how Jehovah expects me to behave,
00:01:51 then how can I expect him to listen to my prayers or even consider them?’
00:01:55 My family never told me to go or not to go to university,
00:01:59 but they reminded me of Jehovah’s thinking.
00:02:02 My dad read Proverbs 27:11 to me.
00:02:05 What I was doing was a barrier
00:02:07 between me and Jehovah.
00:02:09 He helped me see
00:02:10 that the decisions I make as a teenager affect Jehovah.
00:02:14 At that time, there were many videos,
00:02:16 articles, and publications about this topic.
00:02:19 Reading experiences of those who went through similar things,
00:02:22 doing personal study on the subject,
00:02:25 and talking with spiritually mature brothers while in the ministry
00:02:29 was very helpful for me.
00:02:31 Something that my parents did
00:02:33 that helped me a lot was that they used the book
00:02:36 Young People Ask  in our family study.
00:02:38 And there’s a chapter that talks about peer pressure.
00:02:47 Afterward, I was able to cope.
00:02:50 What helped me the most was something I heard at a circuit assembly.
00:02:53 The speaker said in his talk: “Yes, our young people
00:02:56 “have a lot of challenges right now.
00:02:59 “And when it comes to higher education,
00:03:01 “maybe their classmates and teachers are pressuring them.
00:03:04 “But you young people (it felt like he spoke to me personally),
00:03:08 “your teacher or classmate might not even be
00:03:11 “part of your life in the future.
00:03:12 “But if you want Jehovah always to be in your life,
00:03:15 then you need to make your decisions accordingly.”
00:03:21 It was like a light went on in my head.
00:03:26 Now I was sure about what I needed to do.
00:03:29 I had to speak to her.
00:03:32 One day, I prayed to Jehovah and got up the courage.
00:03:37 I told her that it couldn’t continue with us.
00:03:41 Of course, explaining that to my classmates
00:03:43 and to my teachers was a little hard.
00:03:46 I mean, it was difficult for them to understand.
00:03:48 Sure, I explained it, but they said, “Why would you do that?”
00:03:54 For whoever is in the same situation that I was in,
00:03:58 the best thing to do
00:04:00 is to talk to someone you trust, tell them how you feel,
00:04:04 and ask for help.
00:04:12 Our Creator, Jehovah, is the one who thinks about me and loves me most.
00:04:18 He hasn’t deprived me of anything good.
00:04:21 He always helps us and never leaves us.
00:04:24 I’m so grateful to Jehovah.
