00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:10.823 line:10% position:50% align:center
I went to a vocational school

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:12.324 line:10% position:50% align:center
where I was able to fast-track

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:13.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
learning a trade.

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unexpectedly,
I finished at the top of my class.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, my teachers and my classmates

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to expect a lot more from me.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were saying: “You’re doing so well.

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You represent the school.

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will have to work hard.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:28.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ll do great things.

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:29.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll go far.”

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were constantly putting pressure on me

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:35.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go for higher education
and to go to university.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.682 line:10% position:50% align:center
There was this girl

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.309 line:10% position:50% align:center
in high school who was my age.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was very friendly.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always paid attention to me;
she was a nice person.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:46.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also thought she was cute.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
My classmates were like: “Go, talk to her!”

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Hey, Isaac,
do you know that she likes you?”

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I wasn’t sure what to do.

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, when I chose to go to that school,

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:01.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
higher education wasn’t the reason.

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:03.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to fast-track getting a trade

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:06.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and starting a job
so that I could earn my income.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:08.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what I thought.

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a really difficult time for me.

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember praying to Jehovah
in tears for hours.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t ask for advice,

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t talk to friends
or people I trusted about it,

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:23.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even my parents.

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
And little by little, I started to give in

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that pressure that I got
because of this girl.

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the end,
we started to flirt with each other.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
We chatted and sent each other messages.

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I prayed to Jehovah,

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:44.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t feel completely comfortable.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought, ‘If I’m not doing what Jehovah
is asking of me,

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:51.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘if I’m not behaving how Jehovah
expects me to behave,

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:55.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
then how can I expect him to listen
to my prayers or even consider them?’

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:59.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family never told me to go
or not to go to university,

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they reminded me of Jehovah’s thinking.

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:05.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad read Proverbs 27:11 to me.

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I was doing was a barrier

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
between me and Jehovah.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped me see

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:14.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the decisions I make as a teenager
affect Jehovah.

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, there were many videos,

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:19.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
articles, and publications about this topic.

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading experiences of those
who went through similar things,

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:25.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing personal study on the subject,

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking with spiritually mature brothers
while in the ministry

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
was very helpful for me.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that my parents did

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helped me a lot
was that they used the book

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Young People Ask </i> in our family study.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s a chapter
that talks about peer pressure.

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:49.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Afterward, I was able to cope.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped me the most
was something I heard at a circuit assembly.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:56.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
The speaker said in his talk:
“Yes, our young people

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have a lot of challenges right now.

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:01.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And when it comes to higher education,

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:04.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“maybe their classmates and teachers
are pressuring them.

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:08.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But you young people
(it felt like he spoke to me personally),

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:11.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your teacher or classmate might not even be

00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:12.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“part of your life in the future.

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But if you want Jehovah
always to be in your life,

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:18.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you need
to make your decisions accordingly.”

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:23.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a light went on in my head.

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:29.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I was sure about what I needed to do.

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:31.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to speak to her.

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, I prayed to Jehovah
and got up the courage.

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:40.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told her that it couldn’t continue with us.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, explaining that to my classmates

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:46.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to my teachers was a little hard.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean,
it was difficult for them to understand.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:52.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure, I explained it, but they said,
“Why would you do that?”

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
For whoever is in the same situation
that I was in,

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:00.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best thing to do

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to talk to someone you trust,
tell them how you feel,

00:04:04.014 --> 00:04:05.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask for help.

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:17.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Creator, Jehovah, is the one who thinks
about me and loves me most.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
He hasn’t deprived me of anything good.

00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:24.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always helps us and never leaves us.

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:27.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful to Jehovah.
