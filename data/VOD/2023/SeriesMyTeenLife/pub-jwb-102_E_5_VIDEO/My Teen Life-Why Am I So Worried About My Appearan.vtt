00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:10.450 line:10% position:50% align:center
Oh, most definitely I felt awkward.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.328 line:10% position:50% align:center
I didn’t wear my clothes a certain way,

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:17.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
or I didn’t have my hair kept a certain way.

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t wear the latest shoes.

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:21.088 line:10% position:50% align:center
It can be really easy to get caught up

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.214 line:10% position:50% align:center
on social media,

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:24.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to see what the new trends are

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trying to see how others look.

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:27.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Should I look like that?

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:30.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t I look like that?
What can I do to look like that?’

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I paid such a high price

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:35.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the body I was going after.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was going
after unrealistic beauty standards.

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:43.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
It lead me to being diagnosed
with an eating disorder.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:47.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
My focusing on my appearance too much
affected me spiritually.

00:00:47.703 --> 00:00:52.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I was in service,
even though I was at a meeting,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though I was present for family worship
—I wasn’t focused.

00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:58.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was thinking more
of what I’m going to wear tomorrow.

00:00:58.883 --> 00:01:01.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents were a great help.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
They took time
to actually listen to my feelings

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what I was going through.

00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:09.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not necessarily a formal setting.

00:01:09.813 --> 00:01:12.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was actually in informal settings

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:14.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
—where we could be in the car
and we were just talking

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:17.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we were sitting on the couch
and watching TV—

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:19.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my dad would just talk to me

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:22.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kind of see how I was doing,
how my day went.

00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:24.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father, he kind of sat me down,

00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:28.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he shared
two really important scriptures with me:

00:01:28.294 --> 00:01:31.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 3:3, 4, where it says:

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not let your adornment be external.”

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t want to focus too much
on how you look,

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your outer appearance,

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:44.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reason being found at Proverbs 31:30,

00:01:44.564 --> 00:01:47.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says: “Beauty may be fleeting.”

00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:53.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though we may put so much effort
into how we look,

00:01:53.283 --> 00:01:56.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our outer appearance,
eventually that’s going to go away.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that has really helped me is

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving myself time in the day

00:02:01.877 --> 00:02:05.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get off of social media
—getting off the Internet

00:02:05.423 --> 00:02:08.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and giving time (dedicating time) to Jehovah.

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:11.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
I unfollowed models and influencers

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:14.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made me feel more insecure about myself,

00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:18.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would study
Bible characters of the past,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Abigail,

00:02:20.024 --> 00:02:21.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah,

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:22.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ruth.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Letting myself be influenced by them

00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:28.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a game changer for me.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
What made them more beautiful
in the eyes of Jehovah

00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:35.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
were their qualities,
how they treated others, their personality,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they served Jehovah with loyalty.

00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:42.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I examined those scriptures,
I feel like something clicked in my head.

00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:45.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being attractive physically

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:50.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it just didn’t really make
much of a difference to me anymore.

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:53.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
By making sure I prayed
before my day started,

00:02:53.398 --> 00:02:56.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned to really let Jehovah in

00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:58.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make my prayers meaningful.

00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:00.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were a few elders—

00:03:00.323 --> 00:03:04.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some even became almost as close
as best friends to me.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders really helped me

00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:12.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it came to how I could take
more attention off of myself

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how I could focus on helping others.

00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:19.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that I’m making Jehovah happy

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
by helping others get to know him
and making disciples

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:25.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what makes me happy now.

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a pioneer,
I finally was able to attend

00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:31.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
my first pioneer school
in March of 2021,

00:03:31.527 --> 00:03:34.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was an amazing blessing from Jehovah.

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
I work on being more open with people,

00:03:37.576 --> 00:03:41.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
on being more present,
on being more available.

00:03:45.294 --> 00:03:47.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
And trust me, it’s paid off for me,

00:03:47.797 --> 00:03:51.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
because eventually I received

00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:54.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
many more privileges in the congregation.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to serve in different capacities
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
And above all, I was more happy.
