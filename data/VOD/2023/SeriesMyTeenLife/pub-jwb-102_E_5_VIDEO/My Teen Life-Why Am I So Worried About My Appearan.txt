00:00:08 Oh, most definitely I felt awkward.
00:00:10 I didn’t wear my clothes a certain way,
00:00:13 or I didn’t have my hair kept a certain way.
00:00:17 I didn’t wear the latest shoes.
00:00:19 It can be really easy to get caught up
00:00:21 on social media,
00:00:22 trying to see what the new trends are
00:00:24 and trying to see how others look.
00:00:26 ‘Should I look like that?
00:00:27 Why don’t I look like that? What can I do to look like that?’
00:00:30 And I paid such a high price
00:00:32 for the body I was going after.
00:00:37 I was going after unrealistic beauty standards.
00:00:40 It lead me to being diagnosed with an eating disorder.
00:00:43 My focusing on my appearance too much affected me spiritually.
00:00:47 Even though I was in service, even though I was at a meeting,
00:00:52 even though I was present for family worship —I wasn’t focused.
00:00:56 I was thinking more of what I’m going to wear tomorrow.
00:00:58 My parents were a great help.
00:01:01 They took time to actually listen to my feelings
00:01:04 on what I was going through.
00:01:07 It was not necessarily a formal setting.
00:01:09 It was actually in informal settings
00:01:12 —where we could be in the car and we were just talking
00:01:14 or we were sitting on the couch and watching TV—
00:01:17 and my dad would just talk to me
00:01:19 and kind of see how I was doing, how my day went.
00:01:22 My father, he kind of sat me down,
00:01:24 and he shared two really important scriptures with me:
00:01:28 First Peter 3:3, 4, where it says:
00:01:31 “Do not let your adornment be external.”
00:01:35 You don’t want to focus too much on how you look,
00:01:38 on your outer appearance,
00:01:40 and the reason being found at Proverbs 31:30,
00:01:44 where it says: “Beauty may be fleeting.”
00:01:48 So even though we may put so much effort into how we look,
00:01:53 on our outer appearance, eventually that’s going to go away.
00:01:56 Something that has really helped me is
00:01:59 giving myself time in the day
00:02:01 to get off of social media —getting off the Internet
00:02:05 and giving time (dedicating time) to Jehovah.
00:02:08 I unfollowed models and influencers
00:02:11 who made me feel more insecure about myself,
00:02:14 and I would study Bible characters of the past,
00:02:18 such as Abigail,
00:02:20 Sarah,
00:02:21 Ruth.
00:02:22 Letting myself be influenced by them
00:02:26 was a game changer for me.
00:02:28 What made them more beautiful in the eyes of Jehovah
00:02:31 were their qualities, how they treated others, their personality,
00:02:35 how they served Jehovah with loyalty.
00:02:38 As I examined those scriptures, I feel like something clicked in my head.
00:02:42 Being attractive physically
00:02:45 —it just didn’t really make much of a difference to me anymore.
00:02:50 By making sure I prayed before my day started,
00:02:53 I learned to really let Jehovah in
00:02:56 and make my prayers meaningful.
00:02:58 There were a few elders—
00:03:00 Some even became almost as close as best friends to me.
00:03:06 The elders really helped me
00:03:07 when it came to how I could take more attention off of myself
00:03:12 and how I could focus on helping others.
00:03:17 Knowing that I’m making Jehovah happy
00:03:19 by helping others get to know him and making disciples
00:03:22 is what makes me happy now.
00:03:25 And as a pioneer, I finally was able to attend
00:03:28 my first pioneer school in March of 2021,
00:03:31 which was an amazing blessing from Jehovah.
00:03:34 I work on being more open with people,
00:03:37 on being more present, on being more available.
00:03:45 And trust me, it’s paid off for me,
00:03:47 because eventually I received
00:03:51 many more privileges in the congregation.
00:03:54 I was able to serve in different capacities in Jehovah’s organization.
00:03:59 And above all, I was more happy.
