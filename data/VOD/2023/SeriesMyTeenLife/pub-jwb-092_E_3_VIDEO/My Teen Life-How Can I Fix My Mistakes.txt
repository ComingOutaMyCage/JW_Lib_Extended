00:00:08 I started to make a lot of friends at school,
00:00:11 and aside from school, I began learning how to Rollerblade.
00:00:15 So whenever I’d go out to practice, I’d meet lots of different people.
00:00:19 I made some mistakes
00:00:21 because of bad associations.
00:00:23 We started going out at night and maybe just drinking a little alcohol.
00:00:27 But eventually, we were drinking a lot.
00:00:30 By the time I realized what was happening,
00:00:33 I was already really involved.
00:00:34 I was 17 years old.
00:00:36 I started being close friends with them.
00:00:38 They were everything to me, and I really trusted them.
00:00:42 They were doing some wrong things
00:00:44 like doing drugs and using bad language.
00:00:47 But I thought: ‘I’m just with them.
00:00:49 As long as I don’t do what they’re doing, it’s not a problem.’
00:00:58 I began to make excuses, saying that it didn’t really matter
00:01:02 and that there wasn’t anything wrong with what I was doing.
00:01:05 My spiritual routine was just going to the meetings.
00:01:08 I started missing some meetings.
00:01:10 I never prayed. I didn’t even know how to do personal study.
00:01:13 I wasn’t reading the Bible every day.
00:01:16 In this group of friends,
00:01:18 there was a boy who liked me and asked me out.
00:01:22 And since all my friends were dating, I thought, ‘Why not?’
00:01:25 So I started dating him, and my parents had no idea.
00:01:28 I’d lie about where I was going, what I’d be doing, and who I’d be with.
00:01:32 I was pretty much two completely different people.
00:01:35 At home, I was one way, and with my friends, I was another.
00:01:39 I tried to pray to Jehovah, but I just couldn’t.
00:01:42 I felt ashamed because I knew inside
00:01:45 that Jehovah wasn’t happy with what I was doing.
00:01:48 My conscience really bothered me.
00:01:55 There was a moment when my boyfriend
00:01:57 and then some of those friends really let me down.
00:02:00 I began thinking about how I didn’t have anyone else in my life.
00:02:05 One time, we were all drinking,
00:02:07 and this girl invited us all to go to her house.
00:02:10 I started thinking
00:02:12 about what might happen if I said yes to that girl’s invitation.
00:02:17 I knew that there’d be drinking, drugs,
00:02:21 and maybe even something immoral might happen.
00:02:24 So after having not prayed for a really long time,
00:02:27 I closed my eyes and said: “Jehovah, please help me.
00:02:33 I’m just so alone. I don’t have anyone.”
00:02:38 I felt completely abandoned by everyone.
00:02:42 So right then and there, I said a prayer to Jehovah,
00:02:45 asking him that if he would help me to say no,
00:02:48 from that day forward, I would stop associating with those friends
00:02:52 and serve him whole-souled.
00:02:54 Many times, I asked Jehovah to forgive me.
00:02:56 I said: “Jehovah, you’re the only one I have.
00:03:00 Please help me.”
00:03:02 And that’s exactly what happened.
00:03:03 After saying that prayer, I felt determined to leave.
00:03:07 I started thinking about everything that I’d done
00:03:10 and how I was putting not only my own life at risk
00:03:13 but also my relationship with Jehovah.
00:03:16 I thought, ‘I’m going to talk to the elders.’
00:03:19 Since I’m a very shy person,
00:03:21 the thought of confessing my mistakes was really difficult.
00:03:24 I talked to them, and I told them everything that had happened.
00:03:28 It was like a weight had been lifted off me.
00:03:33 I saw that I really wasn’t alone after all.
00:03:35 I still remember a scripture that they read to me
00:03:37 at Psalm 86:5,
00:03:39 which showed me that Jehovah’s forgiveness
00:03:41 has no limits if I’m truly repentant.
00:03:44 So I knew that Jehovah would forgive me.
00:03:46 But the elders also told me that I’d have to tell my parents,
00:03:50 which was very difficult.
00:03:52 But I thought, ‘Well, I need to speak up.’
00:03:55 And I just opened up and told them about what had happened.
00:04:04 I decided that I was going talk with an elder,
00:04:06 and he read a scripture with me from Philippians 4:7,
00:04:09 which says that “the peace of God
00:04:11 “that surpasses all understanding
00:04:14 will guard [our] hearts.”
00:04:17 So I was able to pray again, knowing that if I really changed,
00:04:21 I could feel that peace that comes from Jehovah.
00:04:23 I started studying the Bible for real.
00:04:27 I stopped associating with those friends
00:04:30 and started being more involved in spiritual things.
00:04:33 I had the privilege of getting baptized and becoming a regular pioneer.
00:04:37 And today, I’m serving at Bethel.
00:04:39 I had the privilege of being invited to help with construction projects,
00:04:42 but my greatest privilege
00:04:45 is the strong friendship that I have with Jehovah
00:04:48 and also having true friends.
00:04:51 I’ve seen that Jehovah has always been by my side.
00:04:55 And even when I didn’t want to be with him,
00:04:57 Jehovah never abandoned me.
