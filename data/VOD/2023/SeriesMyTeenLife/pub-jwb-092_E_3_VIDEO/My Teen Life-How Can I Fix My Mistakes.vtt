00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.826 line:10% position:50% align:center
I started to make a lot of friends at school,

00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:15.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and aside from school,
I began learning how to Rollerblade.

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:18.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whenever I’d go out to practice,
I’d meet lots of different people.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:21.838 line:10% position:50% align:center
I made some mistakes

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:23.590 line:10% position:50% align:center
because of bad associations.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
We started going out at night
and maybe just drinking a little alcohol.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
But eventually, we were drinking a lot.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the time I realized what was happening,

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was already really involved.

00:00:34.894 --> 00:00:36.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was 17 years old.

00:00:36.897 --> 00:00:38.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started being close friends with them.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were everything to me,
and I really trusted them.

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:44.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were doing some wrong things

00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:47.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
like doing drugs and using bad language.

00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:49.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I thought: ‘I’m just with them.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as I don’t do what they’re doing,
it’s not a problem.’

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:02.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began to make excuses,
saying that it didn’t really matter

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:05.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that there wasn’t anything wrong
with what I was doing.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
My spiritual routine
was just going to the meetings.

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:10.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started missing some meetings.

00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:13.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never prayed.
I didn’t even know how to do personal study.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t reading the Bible every day.

00:01:16.318 --> 00:01:18.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this group of friends,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a boy who liked me
and asked me out.

00:01:22.158 --> 00:01:25.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since all my friends were dating,
I thought, ‘Why not?’

00:01:25.537 --> 00:01:28.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started dating him,
and my parents had no idea.

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:32.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d lie about where I was going,
what I’d be doing, and who I’d be with.

00:01:32.754 --> 00:01:35.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was pretty much
two completely different people.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:39.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
At home, I was one way,
and with my friends, I was another.

00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:42.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to pray to Jehovah,
but I just couldn’t.

00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:45.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt ashamed because I knew inside

00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:48.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah wasn’t happy
with what I was doing.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
My conscience really bothered me.

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:57.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a moment when my boyfriend

00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:00.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then some of those friends
really let me down.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:05.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began thinking about how I
didn’t have anyone else in my life.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
One time, we were all drinking,

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:10.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this girl invited us all
to go to her house.

00:02:10.882 --> 00:02:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started thinking

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:16.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what might happen
if I said yes to that girl’s invitation.

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:21.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that there’d be drinking, drugs,

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe even something immoral
might happen.

00:02:24.564 --> 00:02:27.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after having not prayed
for a really long time,

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:32.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
I closed my eyes and said:
“Jehovah, please help me.

00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:37.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just so alone.
I don’t have anyone.”

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt completely abandoned by everyone.

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:45.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
So right then and there,
I said a prayer to Jehovah,

00:02:45.797 --> 00:02:48.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking him
that if he would help me to say no,

00:02:48.843 --> 00:02:52.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
from that day forward,
I would stop associating with those friends

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:54.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve him whole-souled.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times,
I asked Jehovah to forgive me.

00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:59.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said:
“Jehovah, you’re the only one I have.

00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:02.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please help me.”

00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:03.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly what happened.

00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:07.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
After saying that prayer,
I felt determined to leave.

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started thinking
about everything that I’d done

00:03:10.618 --> 00:03:13.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how I was putting
not only my own life at risk

00:03:13.747 --> 00:03:16.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also my relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:19.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought, ‘I’m going to talk to the elders.’

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:21.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I’m a very shy person,

00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:24.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
the thought of confessing my mistakes
was really difficult.

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:28.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I talked to them,
and I told them everything that had happened.

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:31.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a weight had been lifted off me.

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:35.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw that I really wasn’t alone after all.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still remember a scripture
that they read to me

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:39.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 86:5,

00:03:39.902 --> 00:03:41.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
which showed me that Jehovah’s forgiveness

00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:44.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
has no limits if I’m truly repentant.

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I knew that Jehovah would forgive me.

00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:50.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the elders also told me
that I’d have to tell my parents,

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:52.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was very difficult.

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:55.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I thought, ‘Well, I need to speak up.’

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:59.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just opened up
and told them about what had happened.

00:04:04.014 --> 00:04:06.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided
that I was going talk with an elder,

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:09.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he read a scripture with me
from Philippians 4:7,

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:11.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says that “the peace of God

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that surpasses all understanding

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:16.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
will guard [our] hearts.”

00:04:17.154 --> 00:04:21.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was able to pray again,
knowing that if I really changed,

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:23.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could feel that peace
that comes from Jehovah.

00:04:23.912 --> 00:04:27.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started studying the Bible for real.

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stopped associating with those friends

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started being more involved
in spiritual things.

00:04:33.924 --> 00:04:37.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the privilege of getting baptized
and becoming a regular pioneer.

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:39.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today, I’m serving at Bethel.

00:04:39.138 --> 00:04:42.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the privilege of being invited
to help with construction projects,

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:45.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my greatest privilege

00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:48.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the strong friendship
that I have with Jehovah

00:04:48.274 --> 00:04:51.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also having true friends.

00:04:51.402 --> 00:04:55.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen that Jehovah
has always been by my side.

00:04:55.115 --> 00:04:57.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even when I didn’t want to be with him,

00:04:57.618 --> 00:04:59.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never abandoned me.
