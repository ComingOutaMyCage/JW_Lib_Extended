Shortly after getting baptized,

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:21.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
I set the goal of becoming a regular pioneer.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I went to preach in an unassigned
territory where Miskito is spoken.

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that,
I started serving as a special pioneer.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:34.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some time later,

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went to the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time ago,
I began to suffer from kidney failure.

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it felt like I wasn’t
doing anything anymore,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I couldn’t go back in time.

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up in a Christian family.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad worked in the construction
of the Bethel branch

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then served as a Bethelite for some time.

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom was a regular pioneer
when she was younger.

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
She also volunteered at Bethel,

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:09.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s how she met my dad.

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some years ago,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started suffering
from severe anxiety attacks,

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that really affected me
in the congregation.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to compare myself to others,

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:23.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I did the same with my parents.

00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:27.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt I could never
live up to their example.

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up in a family
where I wasn’t made to feel—

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:37.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never really felt adequate.

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:42.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt so worthless;
I felt very alone.

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
When my health problems began,

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started comparing myself.

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began thinking about what
I was able to do before

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and about how my activity had gone down.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
This <i>Watchtower</i>  study helped me to see

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
how some previous assignments

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
could help me to do things better
in my current assignment.

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped me to think
about what I can do now.

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think this <i>Watchtower </i> article
came just at the right time.

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:24.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned that comparing
myself to others is very damaging,

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was bringing me down spiritually.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now that I’ve set the goal
to stop doing that,

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen good results.

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve had the chance to make good friends

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:38.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
with older brothers and sisters
in the congregation.

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:44.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when some of them
needed help and turned to me,

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:49.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was happy to help them,
and that encouraged me a lot.

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I started going to the meetings,

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:55.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was somewhat afraid

00:02:55.362 --> 00:02:59.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was going to be inadequate
in the congregation.

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:06.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paragraph 20 of this <i>Watchtower </i> study

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps me understand that I should

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
use the gifts that the congregation

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially Jehovah
have helped me to discover

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:19.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage the congregation.

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:27.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
having raised two children
alone as a young, single mother

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:30.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
(being able to do that),

00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:35.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could help others in the congregation
who were going through the same experience.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:38.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve set concrete goals for myself,

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:40.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
like helping to clean the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:45.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although it’s lighter work,
it’s helped me tremendously.

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:51.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives me a lot of joy
to know that it’s for Jehovah.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:56.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I try to help out the congregation
wherever I can.

00:03:58.258 --> 00:04:01.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking to an audience
might not be easy for me,

00:04:03.722 --> 00:04:07.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah has helped me
to carry out my assignments.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that has helped me to realize
my place in Jehovah’s congregation.

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:18.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has helped a lot
in developing my self-esteem

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not to dwell on the past,

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:24.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the old feelings of inadequacy,

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
or dwell on the perfection
that I used to demand from myself.

00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:33.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
I discovered I have something good
to give to the congregation.

00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:37.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers need the good deeds
that we’re able to do.

00:04:40.342 --> 00:04:45.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives me a lot of joy to see
that I can help others overcome their trials,

00:04:48.183 --> 00:04:53.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this really helps me understand
that I do have a role in the congregation.
