00:00:16 Shortly after getting baptized,
00:00:18 I set the goal of becoming a regular pioneer.
00:00:22 Then I went to preach in an unassigned territory where Miskito is spoken.
00:00:28 After that, I started serving as a special pioneer.
00:00:33 And some time later,
00:00:34 I went to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:00:38 Some time ago, I began to suffer from kidney failure.
00:00:42 So it felt like I wasn’t doing anything anymore,
00:00:46 and I couldn’t go back in time.
00:00:50 I grew up in a Christian family.
00:00:52 My dad worked in the construction of the Bethel branch
00:00:55 and then served as a Bethelite for some time.
00:00:59 My mom was a regular pioneer when she was younger.
00:01:03 She also volunteered at Bethel,
00:01:07 and that’s how she met my dad.
00:01:09 Some years ago,
00:01:11 I started suffering from severe anxiety attacks,
00:01:14 and that really affected me in the congregation.
00:01:18 I started to compare myself to others,
00:01:21 and I did the same with my parents.
00:01:24 I felt I could never live up to their example.
00:01:29 I grew up in a family where I wasn’t made to feel—
00:01:34 I never really felt adequate.
00:01:38 I felt so worthless; I felt very alone.
00:01:44 When my health problems began,
00:01:47 I started comparing myself.
00:01:51 I began thinking about what I was able to do before
00:01:55 and about how my activity had gone down.
00:01:59 This Watchtower  study helped me to see
00:02:01 how some previous assignments
00:02:04 could help me to do things better in my current assignment.
00:02:10 That helped me to think about what I can do now.
00:02:14 I think this Watchtower  article came just at the right time.
00:02:20 I’ve learned that comparing myself to others is very damaging,
00:02:24 and it was bringing me down spiritually.
00:02:28 So now that I’ve set the goal to stop doing that,
00:02:31 I’ve seen good results.
00:02:34 I’ve had the chance to make good friends
00:02:36 with older brothers and sisters in the congregation.
00:02:41 And when some of them needed help and turned to me,
00:02:45 I was happy to help them, and that encouraged me a lot.
00:02:50 When I started going to the meetings,
00:02:53 I was somewhat afraid
00:02:55 I was going to be inadequate in the congregation.
00:03:03 Paragraph 20 of this Watchtower  study
00:03:07 helps me understand that I should
00:03:10 use the gifts that the congregation
00:03:12 and especially Jehovah have helped me to discover
00:03:16 to encourage the congregation.
00:03:20 For example,
00:03:23 having raised two children alone as a young, single mother
00:03:28 (being able to do that),
00:03:30 I could help others in the congregation who were going through the same experience.
00:03:36 I’ve set concrete goals for myself,
00:03:38 like helping to clean the Kingdom Hall.
00:03:43 Although it’s lighter work, it’s helped me tremendously.
00:03:48 It gives me a lot of joy to know that it’s for Jehovah.
00:03:53 Now I try to help out the congregation wherever I can.
00:03:58 Speaking to an audience might not be easy for me,
00:04:03 but Jehovah has helped me to carry out my assignments.
00:04:08 And that has helped me to realize my place in Jehovah’s congregation.
00:04:14 This has helped a lot in developing my self-esteem
00:04:18 —not to dwell on the past,
00:04:21 on the old feelings of inadequacy,
00:04:24 or dwell on the perfection that I used to demand from myself.
00:04:28 I discovered I have something good to give to the congregation.
00:04:34 The brothers need the good deeds that we’re able to do.
00:04:40 It gives me a lot of joy to see that I can help others overcome their trials,
00:04:48 and this really helps me understand that I do have a role in the congregation.
