00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:12.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostle Paul wrote
to Christians in Ephesus

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:14.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
about unity in the congregation,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
he compared the Mosaic Law

00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a wall that divided Jews and Gentiles.

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul may have been alluding to the wall

00:00:29.177 --> 00:00:31.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
that surrounded the inner courtyards

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:34.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the first-century temple in Jerusalem.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
This low wall, called the Soreg,

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
marked the boundary

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Gentiles could not cross.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only Jews were permitted

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enter further into the temple area.

00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:59.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to first-century Jewish historian Josephus,

00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:02.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Soreg had signs in Greek and Latin

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:05.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
warning non-Jews not to go beyond it.

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:07.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apparently, those who did

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:09.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
could face the death penalty.

00:01:11.182 --> 00:01:13.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two such signs have been found

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:16.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one in 1871

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
and another in 1935.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
They both bear inscriptions

00:01:21.193 --> 00:01:24.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
warning foreigners not to enter.

00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:27.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion,

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:29.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul was mobbed in the temple

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:30.870 line:10% position:50% align:center
because the Jews wrongly accused him

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.705 line:10% position:50% align:center
of bringing Gentiles

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:35.709 line:10% position:50% align:center
into the area fenced off by the Soreg.

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:40.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
The symbolic wall of the Mosaic Law

00:01:40.422 --> 00:01:43.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
that divided Jews and Gentiles

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:46.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
was abolished on the basis of Christ’s death.
