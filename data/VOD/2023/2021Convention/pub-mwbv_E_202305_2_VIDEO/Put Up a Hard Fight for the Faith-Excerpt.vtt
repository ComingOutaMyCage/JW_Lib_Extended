00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first, let’s talk about apostasy,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:07.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll call it spiritual poison.

00:00:08.405 --> 00:00:10.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about poison.

00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:13.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the best way to avoid being poisoned?

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have to recognize poison
when we see it, and then avoid it.

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same principle applies to teachings

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:23.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could destroy our faith.

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:26.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s not always easy.

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:28.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not many of our brothers and sisters

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
would deliberately
get involved with apostates,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it could happen without our realizing it.

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:37.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
We receive letters at times
from brothers and sisters

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:41.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are troubled
by something they saw on a web page,

00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:43.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
an accusation, a rumor

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:46.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the Society,
or about the organization.

00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:49.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the problem is, they had no idea

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:52.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
that apostates were behind it.

00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:55.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s tricky
because the apostates don’t advertise,

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:58.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are now on an apostate web page.”

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
They often pose as sincere Witnesses

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:04.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
who just have questions or concerns.

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:06.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some who aren’t really apostates

00:01:06.972 --> 00:01:09.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
can cause just as much trouble
as the apostates do

00:01:09.892 --> 00:01:12.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
by their negative talk and criticism.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, we need to be on the alert.

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:18.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is serious.

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose that out of curiosity

00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:23.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
you get into a discussion forum
with individuals

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
who claim to be Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe they are, maybe they aren’t.
You don’t know.

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve never met them.

00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:31.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
And someone starts asking questions:

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What did you think
of last month’s broadcast?

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:37.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you really find it encouraging?”

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:40.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Do you think the brothers who write
<i>Watchtower</i>  articles

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:41.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are living in the real world?

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:45.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder if they realize
just how hard it is out here.”

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then a few others join in
with their own negative comments.

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:52.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you don’t know whether these individuals

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:54.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
are apostates or just brothers and sisters

00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are in serious spiritual trouble.

00:01:56.947 --> 00:01:58.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does it matter?

00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:01.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does it make you feel?

00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:04.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you leave the forum,
do you feel upbuilt,

00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:07.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
determined to expand your ministry,

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:10.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
more convinced than ever that Jehovah
has an organization 

00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:13.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you love and that you’re delighted
to be a part of?

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you feel honored
to be a part of that organization?

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or does the experience leave you sad,

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:23.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
uneasy, uncomfortable?

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, someone might say,
“I need to get involved in that forum

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:30.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can help those people.”

00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:32.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
They shouldn’t be together.

00:02:32.988 --> 00:02:37.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if they aren’t apostates,
they’re not good for one another.

00:02:37.243 --> 00:02:40.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Staying in that forum to “help someone”

00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:42.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like holding his hand
while he drinks poison

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:45.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then having some yourself
so that he doesn’t have to drink alone.

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:48.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to follow the advice

00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:52.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded at Romans 16:17.

00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:56.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now think about this imaginary forum
that we just described

00:02:56.557 --> 00:03:01.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the light of Romans 16:17.

00:03:01.104 --> 00:03:05.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, there are all kinds
of negative talk flying around in this forum;

00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:07.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
you don’t know who’s behind it.

00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:11.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s what it says at Romans 16:17:

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I urge you, brothers,

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:16.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to keep your eye on those

00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who create divisions

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and causes for stumbling

00:03:24.297 --> 00:03:27.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
“contrary to the teaching
that you have learned,

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:29.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoid them.”

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now think about that forum.

00:03:32.432 --> 00:03:35.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it create divisions?

00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:36.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:38.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it a cause for stumbling?

00:03:38.897 --> 00:03:40.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could be.

00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:42.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it contrary to what we have learned?

00:03:42.902 --> 00:03:46.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we even have to answer that question?

00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:48.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, whether it’s intended or not,

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:50.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
the effect will be to weaken our faith.

00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:51.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we do?

00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:54.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Paul tell us to do here
at the end of verse 17?

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Avoid them.”

00:03:58.628 --> 00:04:01.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’d like to say a kind word

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:05.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
to some who may be involved
in discussion forums.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:09.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may like to use this medium
to blow off steam, so to speak.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe there are little things
in the congregation that are happening 

00:04:12.394 --> 00:04:15.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you wonder about
or decisions the elders have made

00:04:15.523 --> 00:04:18.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you wonder about,
and so you write.

00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:20.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
You get involved in the forum,
and you blow off steam,

00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:23.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and after that, you feel better.

00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:25.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about others in the forum?

00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:27.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do they feel?

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:29.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you feel awful

00:04:29.747 --> 00:04:32.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
if negative comments you made
were responsible

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
for someone leaving the truth?

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:36.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you wouldn’t want that to happen.

00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:39.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please, please,

00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:42.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
be careful about what you say.

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:44.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another person might say:

00:04:44.598 --> 00:04:47.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, I can see where those warnings
about apostates apply to so-and-so.

00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:49.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He’s weak, but don’t worry about me.

00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:51.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m spiritually strong.
I can handle it.”

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:56.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s like a weight lifter
thinking that he can drink a vial of poison

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it won’t hurt him
because he’s so big and strong.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:04.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are not so strong,
so spiritual, so intelligent

00:05:04.663 --> 00:05:09.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can’t be affected
by the poison of apostate ideas.
