00:00:01 So first, let’s talk about apostasy,
00:00:03 and we’ll call it spiritual poison.
00:00:08 Now, think about poison.
00:00:10 What’s the best way to avoid being poisoned?
00:00:13 Well, we have to recognize poison when we see it, and then avoid it.
00:00:18 And the same principle applies to teachings
00:00:21 that could destroy our faith.
00:00:24 And that’s not always easy.
00:00:26 No, not many of our brothers and sisters
00:00:28 would deliberately get involved with apostates,
00:00:31 but it could happen without our realizing it.
00:00:34 We receive letters at times from brothers and sisters
00:00:37 who are troubled by something they saw on a web page,
00:00:41 an accusation, a rumor
00:00:43 about the Society, or about the organization.
00:00:46 And the problem is, they had no idea
00:00:49 that apostates were behind it.
00:00:52 It’s tricky because the apostates don’t advertise,
00:00:55 “You are now on an apostate web page.”
00:00:58 They often pose as sincere Witnesses
00:01:00 who just have questions or concerns.
00:01:04 And some who aren’t really apostates
00:01:06 can cause just as much trouble as the apostates do
00:01:09 by their negative talk and criticism.
00:01:12 Brothers, we need to be on the alert.
00:01:16 This is serious.
00:01:18 Suppose that out of curiosity
00:01:20 you get into a discussion forum with individuals
00:01:23 who claim to be Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:25 Now, maybe they are, maybe they aren’t. You don’t know.
00:01:27 You’ve never met them.
00:01:29 And someone starts asking questions:
00:01:31 “What did you think of last month’s broadcast?
00:01:34 Did you really find it encouraging?”
00:01:37 or “Do you think the brothers who write Watchtower  articles
00:01:40 “are living in the real world?
00:01:41 I wonder if they realize just how hard it is out here.”
00:01:45 And then a few others join in with their own negative comments.
00:01:49 Now, you don’t know whether these individuals
00:01:52 are apostates or just brothers and sisters
00:01:54 who are in serious spiritual trouble.
00:01:56 But does it matter?
00:01:58 How does it make you feel?
00:02:01 When you leave the forum, do you feel upbuilt,
00:02:04 determined to expand your ministry,
00:02:07 more convinced than ever that Jehovah has an organization
00:02:10 that you love and that you’re delighted to be a part of?
00:02:13 Do you feel honored to be a part of that organization?
00:02:16 Or does the experience leave you sad,
00:02:20 uneasy, uncomfortable?
00:02:24 Now, someone might say, “I need to get involved in that forum
00:02:28 so that I can help those people.”
00:02:30 They shouldn’t be together.
00:02:32 Even if they aren’t apostates, they’re not good for one another.
00:02:37 Staying in that forum to “help someone”
00:02:40 is like holding his hand while he drinks poison
00:02:42 and then having some yourself so that he doesn’t have to drink alone.
00:02:46 We need to follow the advice
00:02:48 recorded at Romans 16:17.
00:02:52 Now think about this imaginary forum that we just described
00:02:56 in the light of Romans 16:17.
00:03:01 Remember, there are all kinds of negative talk flying around in this forum;
00:03:05 you don’t know who’s behind it.
00:03:07 And here’s what it says at Romans 16:17:
00:03:12 “Now I urge you, brothers,
00:03:14 “to keep your eye on those
00:03:16 “who create divisions
00:03:20 “and causes for stumbling
00:03:24 “contrary to the teaching that you have learned,
00:03:27 and avoid them.”
00:03:29 Now think about that forum.
00:03:32 Does it create divisions?
00:03:35 Yes.
00:03:36 Is it a cause for stumbling?
00:03:38 Could be.
00:03:40 Is it contrary to what we have learned?
00:03:42 Do we even have to answer that question?
00:03:46 Now, whether it’s intended or not,
00:03:48 the effect will be to weaken our faith.
00:03:50 So, what do we do?
00:03:51 What does Paul tell us to do here at the end of verse 17?
00:03:54 He says: “Avoid them.”
00:03:58 Now, I’d like to say a kind word
00:04:01 to some who may be involved in discussion forums.
00:04:05 You may like to use this medium to blow off steam, so to speak.
00:04:09 Maybe there are little things in the congregation that are happening
00:04:12 that you wonder about or decisions the elders have made
00:04:15 that you wonder about, and so you write.
00:04:18 You get involved in the forum, and you blow off steam,
00:04:20 and after that, you feel better.
00:04:23 But what about others in the forum?
00:04:25 How do they feel?
00:04:27 Wouldn’t you feel awful
00:04:29 if negative comments you made were responsible
00:04:32 for someone leaving the truth?
00:04:34 I know you wouldn’t want that to happen.
00:04:36 So please, please,
00:04:39 be careful about what you say.
00:04:42 Now, another person might say:
00:04:44 “Well, I can see where those warnings about apostates apply to so-and-so.
00:04:47 “He’s weak, but don’t worry about me.
00:04:49 I’m spiritually strong. I can handle it.”
00:04:53 That’s like a weight lifter thinking that he can drink a vial of poison
00:04:56 and it won’t hurt him because he’s so big and strong.
00:05:00 We are not so strong, so spiritual, so intelligent
00:05:04 that we can’t be affected by the poison of apostate ideas.
