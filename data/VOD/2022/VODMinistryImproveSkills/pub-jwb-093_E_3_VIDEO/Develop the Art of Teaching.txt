00:00:30 Stop the ball!
00:00:34 So, what’s your biggest question about life?
00:00:36 Why are people so obsessed with kicking round objects?
00:00:42 Well, there’s that.
00:00:43 But seriously, anything?
00:00:51 Why do people hate?
00:00:53 If we’re all God’s children, what’s the deal?
00:00:56 Good question and one the Bible definitely answers, um.
00:01:01 But you’ve a train to catch.
00:01:03 So we’ll stop there.
00:01:05 But, um, is Tuesday still good?
00:01:10 Assuming space-time hasn’t collapsed into a singularity,
00:01:13 I’m open.
00:01:16 OK, cool.
00:01:20 So, um, on Tuesday, we’ll carry on with,
00:01:24 um, that chapter, this section here . . .
00:01:27 Hey.
00:01:28 Hi.
00:01:43 So?
00:01:46 How’s the study going?
00:01:48 Brilliant!
00:01:49 We’re zipping right through the easy stuff.
00:01:55 So, what I love about this prophecy
00:01:57 is that it was written, like, 200 years before it actually happened,
00:02:00 and every single detail came true.
00:02:04 The men in charge just left the gates open.
00:02:09 I mean, I would have fired anyone that got drunk
00:02:12 and left the city gates open.
00:02:17 Anyway, back to the prophecy . . .
00:02:20 So “God is love,” but he’s going to kill billions.
00:02:23 How does that work?
00:02:24 Well, it’ll make sense later.
00:02:26 But for now,
00:02:27 let’s just focus on what I was talking about earlier.
00:02:30 What’s so nice about this chapter is that it’s talking about prayer.
00:02:32 Well, it’s talking about how Jehovah helps us with prayer,
00:02:36 and so it’s really lovely because we can pray to someone that’s created . . .
00:02:40 Basically, all of this is evidence of “the last days.”
00:02:46 So, what would you say are the signs of the last days?
00:02:53 Wars,
00:02:55 disasters,
00:02:58 rude people, mm, yeah.
00:03:03 Anything else?
00:03:05 No.
00:03:08 OK, that’s fine.
00:03:11 We can just, um— We’ll just review it in the next lesson.
00:03:14 It’s fine.
00:03:15 Do you want to just wrap it up now then?
00:03:17 Yeah.
00:03:22 Is everything OK?
00:03:25 Blissful.
00:03:28 I’m going to go.
00:03:30 All right. Bye, Gladys.
00:03:43 And she just said one word, I just—
00:03:45 I don’t know what to do.
00:03:49 Wow! Thankfully I’ve never had a student like that.
00:03:53 OK, she’s really getting a hang of this irony thing, isn’t she?
00:03:58 But seriously, I—
00:04:01 I really put myself into the study to try and make it live.
00:04:05 And I get “Yes,”
00:04:08 “No,”
00:04:09 “Maybe,”
00:04:10 or another insufferable, off-topic question.
00:04:16 Maybe let’s do a bit of research?
00:04:19 I knew you’d say that.
00:04:22 I’ll put the kettle on.
00:04:24 Thanks, Keesha.
00:04:26 Here we go
00:04:27 —October 2020 Watchtower— this box.
00:04:36 “Exercise self-control by not talking too much.”
00:04:45 I guess I do need help.
00:04:47 But look:
00:04:48 “Let the student see that you’re excited about Bible truths.”
00:04:51 Spot-on there!
00:04:54 “Make friends in the congregation.”
00:04:58 Oh, I could, or maybe we could, do this.
00:05:03 “Look for signs that reveal [her] desire to serve Jehovah.”
00:05:09 Who’s free on Friday?
00:05:11 Sorry, Jade. I’m busy.
00:05:13 Oh.
00:05:15 Yeah. I’d love to.
00:05:18 OK.
00:05:25 Uh, Jade, Jade, my tablet?
00:05:29 No? Gone. OK.
00:05:38 Hey.
00:05:41 Hey.
00:05:43 So a surprise today:
00:05:44 My usual lecture has been canceled in favor of a discussion, and . . .
00:05:51 Jade, I’m not really the drumroll type.
00:05:53 Oh, hey.
00:05:54 Hi.
00:05:55 I’m Neeta, one of Jade’s roommates.
00:05:58 And you’re?
00:05:59 Gladys.
00:06:02 So let’s start with the question you hit me with last time,
00:06:06 which is, Why do we stay neutral when we see injustice?
00:06:10 I take it you’ve had your fair share?
00:06:15 Uh-huh.
00:06:16 Me too,
00:06:17 although not as bad as my mum and dad from what they tell me.
00:06:21 But how will things ever change if we don’t do something about it?
00:06:25 Let’s see what the Bible has to say
00:06:28 at Jeremiah 10:23.
00:06:32 Could you read that?
00:06:35 “I well know, O Jehovah,
00:06:37 “that man’s way does not belong to him.
00:06:41 “It does not belong to man who is walking
00:06:42 even to direct his step.”
00:06:46 But if that’s true, then the future of the human race
00:06:49 is looking quite bleak.
00:06:51 Does that mean then
00:06:53 that there’s no hope for us and there’s no point in carrying on?
00:06:56 What’s the point?
00:06:58 Hmm. Good question.
00:07:00 Very good question.
