Stop the ball!

00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:36.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s your biggest question about life?

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:39.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are people so obsessed
with kicking round objects?

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:43.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s that.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
But seriously, anything?

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:53.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do people hate?

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re all God’s children, what’s the deal?

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good question
and one the Bible definitely answers, um.

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:03.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’ve a train to catch.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:05.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ll stop there.

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, um, is Tuesday still good?

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Assuming space-time hasn’t collapsed
into a singularity,

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:14.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m open.

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:18.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, cool.

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:23.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, um, on Tuesday, we’ll carry on with,

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:26.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
um, that chapter, this section here . . .

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:44.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
So?

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
How’s the study going?

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brilliant!

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:51.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re zipping right through the easy stuff.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what I love about this prophecy

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that it was written,
like, 200 years before it actually happened,

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every single detail came true.

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
The men in charge just left the gates open.

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, I would have fired anyone
that got drunk

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and left the city gates open.

00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:20.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyway, back to the prophecy . . .

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
So “God is love,”
but he’s going to kill billions.

00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does that work?

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’ll make sense later.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:27.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for now,

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:30.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s just focus on what
I was talking about earlier.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:32.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s so nice about this chapter
is that it’s talking about prayer.

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:36.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s talking about how Jehovah
helps us with prayer,

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so it’s really lovely because we can pray
to someone that’s created . . .

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, all of this is evidence
of “the last days.”

00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:50.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would you say
are the signs of the last days?

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:55.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wars,

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
disasters,

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
rude people, mm, yeah.

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:04.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anything else?

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:07.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, that’s fine.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:14.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can just, um—
We’ll just review it in the next lesson.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:15.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s fine.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to just wrap it up now then?

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:24.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is everything OK?

00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:27.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Blissful.

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:30.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to go.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right. Bye, Gladys.

00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she just said one word, I just—

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:47.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know what to do.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! Thankfully I’ve never had
a student like that.

00:03:53.253 --> 00:03:56.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, she’s really getting
a hang of this irony thing, isn’t she?

00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:01.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
But seriously, I—

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:05.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really put myself into the study
to try and make it live.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I get “Yes,”

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No,”

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maybe,”

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:13.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
or another insufferable, off-topic question.

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:18.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe let’s do a bit of research?

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew you’d say that.

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:23.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll put the kettle on.

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks, Keesha.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we go

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:31.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
—October 2020 <i>Watchtower—</i>
this box.

00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:40.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Exercise self-control
by not talking too much.”

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:47.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I do need help.

00:04:47.432 --> 00:04:48.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look:

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:51.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let the student see
that you’re excited about Bible truths.”

00:04:51.937 --> 00:04:53.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spot-on there!

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:57.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Make friends in the congregation.”

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:03.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, I could, or maybe we could, do this.

00:05:03.782 --> 00:05:08.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look for signs
that reveal [her] desire to serve Jehovah.”

00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:11.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who’s free on Friday?

00:05:11.832 --> 00:05:13.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, Jade. I’m busy.

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:14.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah. I’d love to.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, Jade, Jade, my tablet?

00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:31.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
No? Gone. OK.

00:05:38.483 --> 00:05:40.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:42.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:44.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a surprise today:

00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:48.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
My usual lecture has been canceled
in favor of a discussion, and . . .

00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:53.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, I’m not really the drumroll type.

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:54.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, hey.

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:55.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:58.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m Neeta, one of Jade’s roommates.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re?

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:00.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gladys.

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:06.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s start with the question
you hit me with last time,

00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:09.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is, Why do we stay neutral
when we see injustice?

00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:13.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
I take it you’ve had your fair share?

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:16.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:17.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too,

00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:21.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
although not as bad as my mum and dad
from what they tell me.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how will things ever change
if we don’t do something about it?

00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:28.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what the Bible has to say

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:32.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Jeremiah 10:23.

00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:35.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you read that?

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:37.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know, O Jehovah,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that man’s way does not belong to him.

00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It does not belong to man who is walking

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:45.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
even to direct his step.”

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:49.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if that’s true,
then the future of the human race

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:51.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
is looking quite bleak.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean then

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:56.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there’s no hope for us
and there’s no point in carrying on?

00:06:56.895 --> 00:06:58.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:00.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm. Good question.

00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:02.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good question.
