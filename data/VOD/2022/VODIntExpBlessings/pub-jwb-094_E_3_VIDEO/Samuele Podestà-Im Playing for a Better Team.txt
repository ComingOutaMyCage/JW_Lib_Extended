00:00:08 I played in the Series A, which is the top league in Italy.
00:00:13 I was on the National Youth Team,
00:00:17 and I went all the way up to the Men’s National Team.
00:00:22 Just the fact that you are good
00:00:24 at your job is gratifying,
00:00:26 and then there is also the financial aspect.
00:00:31 My mom and dad were Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:34 and so was my older brother.
00:00:38 At a certain point,
00:00:40 I felt conflicted,
00:00:45 especially when I decided to draw closer to the truth.
00:00:50 It was no longer a “family” thing.
00:00:53 In time, something started to develop in me
00:00:57 —a fire, a small fire.
00:00:59 Gradually, I came to the point of dedication to Jehovah,
00:01:04 although I still played.
00:01:06 But maybe —not maybe, definitely—
00:01:11 I wasn’t giving Jehovah my best, my energy.
00:01:16 I was fitting my spiritual life around my work life
00:01:22 and not the other way around.
00:01:26 I excused myself, saying:
00:01:28 “I’m just working.
00:01:30 “It’s a profession.
00:01:33 “Yes, it’s time-consuming,
00:01:37 but it’s of short duration because athletes retire earlier.”
00:01:44 The closer I drew to Jehovah,
00:01:47 the stronger my inner conflicts became.
00:01:56 The circuit overseer who served the area I was associated with helped me.
00:02:02 I had known him since I was a child.
00:02:07 When we met again, the first thing he asked me was,
00:02:11 “Are you happy with what you are doing?”
00:02:17 It seems like a simple question, right?
00:02:21 But this question went deeper.
00:02:29 I’m very grateful to him and his wife for all the time they devoted to me.
00:02:34 They were very busy,
00:02:36 but even on their day off or in the evenings
00:02:39 after long days of activity,
00:02:43 they spent time with me.
00:02:45 In time, I moved to different cities and changed to various teams.
00:02:49 So he entrusted me, so to speak,
00:02:51 to two other families.
00:02:54 They poured themselves out for me,
00:02:57 sacrificing their time,
00:03:01 without ever making me feel bad for what I did.
00:03:05 With regard to decisions about basketball,
00:03:08 they never told me what to do.
00:03:11 I had to reach that decision on my own,
00:03:14 whether I should continue playing or not.
00:03:18 It was their way of life that corrected me, so to speak.
00:03:24 Their example
00:03:26 —their lifestyle, the priorities they set,
00:03:30 and the joy they had in doing what they did—helped me.
00:03:37 It was more their example
00:03:41 than their words.
00:03:44 It helped me understand
00:03:47 what I really wanted from my life.
00:03:52 I started in 1995
00:03:55 and continued until April 2008
00:03:59 when I played my last match.
00:04:04 I, let’s say, made a cut and quit playing basketball.
00:04:09 I’m glad I made it.
00:04:12 Sometimes I say to myself:
00:04:15 ‘If only you’d done it earlier!
00:04:17 If only you’d had the courage earlier!’
00:04:22 I had the privilege of serving as a regular pioneer
00:04:25 for two and a half years.
00:04:28 I was asked if I would like to apply for Bethel service.
00:04:35 And to my surprise, I was invited to the Italy branch
00:04:38 and served there for five years.
00:04:42 A few months after leaving Bethel,
00:04:44 I had the privilege of attending the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:04:50 It was wonderful!
00:04:53 This sport —basketball—
00:04:55 it’s great, it’s thrilling, it’s exciting,
00:04:58 but it’s not the source of true happiness.
00:05:03 It’s true that the world can give you a measure of satisfaction,
00:05:07 but everything comes at a cost.
00:05:14 But it took me a long time to understand this.
00:05:18 Knowing that I am giving Jehovah my best
00:05:22 has made me happy.
00:05:25 Yes, there is a team,
00:05:27 a large one, and we all play for Jehovah.
00:05:30 And its goal is beautiful, it’s exciting,
00:05:33 and its success is sure.
