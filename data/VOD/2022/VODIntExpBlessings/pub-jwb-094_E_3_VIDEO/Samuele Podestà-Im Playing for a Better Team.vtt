00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:12.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
I played in the Series A,
which is the top league in Italy.

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was on the National Youth Team,

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I went all the way up
to the Men’s National Team.

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.003 line:10% position:50% align:center
Just the fact that you are good

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.255 line:10% position:50% align:center
at your job is gratifying,

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.174 line:10% position:50% align:center
and then there is also the financial aspect.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom and dad were Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:38.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so was my older brother.

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:40.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
At a certain point,

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt conflicted,

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:49.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when I decided
to draw closer to the truth.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:53.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was no longer a “family” thing.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, something started to develop in me

00:00:57.244 --> 00:00:59.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a fire, a small fire.

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:04.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gradually,
I came to the point of dedication to Jehovah,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
although I still played.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
But maybe
—not maybe, definitely—

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t giving Jehovah my best, my energy.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:21.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was fitting my spiritual life
around my work life

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the other way around.

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:28.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
I excused myself, saying:

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m just working.

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:32.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s a profession.

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:36.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, it’s time-consuming,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s of short duration
because athletes retire earlier.”

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
The closer I drew to Jehovah,

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
the stronger my inner conflicts became.

00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:01.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
The circuit overseer who served
the area I was associated with helped me.

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:05.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had known him since I was a child.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:11.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we met again,
the first thing he asked me was,

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:14.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you happy with what you are doing?”

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems like a simple question, right?

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this question went deeper.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:33.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m very grateful to him and his wife
for all the time they devoted to me.

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:36.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were very busy,

00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
but even on their day off or in the evenings

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:43.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
after long days of activity,

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:45.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
they spent time with me.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, I moved to different cities
and changed to various teams.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he entrusted me, so to speak,

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:54.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
to two other families.

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:57.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
They poured themselves out for me,

00:02:57.698 --> 00:02:59.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
sacrificing their time,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
without ever making me feel bad
for what I did.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
With regard to decisions about basketball,

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:11.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
they never told me what to do.

00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:14.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to reach that decision on my own,

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether I should continue playing or not.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:23.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was their way of life that corrected me,
so to speak.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their example

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their lifestyle, the priorities they set,

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:35.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the joy they had in doing
what they did—helped me.

00:03:37.863 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was more their example

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:43.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
than their words.

00:03:44.828 --> 00:03:47.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped me understand

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:51.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
what I really wanted from my life.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started in 1995

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continued until April 2008

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I played my last match.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
I, let’s say,
made a cut and quit playing basketball.

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad I made it.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:15.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I say to myself:

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:17.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If only you’d done it earlier!

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
If only you’d had the courage earlier!’

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:25.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the privilege
of serving as a regular pioneer

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
for two and a half years.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was asked
if I would like to apply for Bethel service.

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to my surprise,
I was invited to the Italy branch

00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:41.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
and served there for five years.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:44.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few months after leaving Bethel,

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:48.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the privilege of attending
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:52.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was wonderful!

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
This sport
—basketball—

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:58.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s great, it’s thrilling, it’s exciting,

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:02.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s not the source of true happiness.

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:07.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true that the world
can give you a measure of satisfaction,

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:10.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
but everything comes at a cost.

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:17.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it took me
a long time to understand this.

00:05:18.422 --> 00:05:22.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that I am giving Jehovah my best

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:24.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
has made me happy.

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:27.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, there is a team,

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:30.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
a large one, and we all play for Jehovah.

00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:33.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
And its goal is beautiful, it’s exciting,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its success is sure.
