00:00:38 You’re late!
00:00:40 Hmm?
00:00:42 I said, “You’re late.”
00:00:43 Sorry.
00:01:17 You work here now?
00:01:21 Yeah, just a— Just a few weeks.
00:01:24 You look great.
00:01:29 Um, what can I get you?
00:01:33 I tried texting, you know,
00:01:36 after you ended it.
00:01:41 Chai latte, that was your favorite.
00:01:45 Jade, you were my favorite.
00:01:57 Ollie, you know why I had to . . .
00:02:02 I know.
00:02:05 I know.
00:02:07 But I want to study your religion.
00:02:10 That’s why I texted.
00:02:14 Well, I got a new phone, and I didn’t— I didn’t see them.
00:02:20 OK, but how about I leave you my number,
00:02:25 and we can meet up.
00:02:27 Come on.
00:02:31 And that’s when you walked away.
00:02:33 Tell me you walked away.
00:02:37 He gave me his number.
00:02:39 What?
00:02:42 No.
00:02:43 Jade!
00:02:45 He said he wants to study.
00:02:47 Yeah, he wants to study you.
00:02:51 We can’t read hearts.
00:02:53 I think I can read yours.
00:03:01 He was sweet,
00:03:03 and if he wants to know the truth . . .
00:03:09 I—  I can’t even believe this.
00:03:15 What does it say?
00:03:18 It says low battery.
00:03:22 No, not that, this—2 Corinthians 6:14.
00:03:29 “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.”
00:03:34 There was no yoking. I haven’t yoked.
00:03:37 But this opens the door to the yoke.
00:03:40 I’m not stupid!
00:03:41 You act like I don’t know this.
00:03:43 No. You act like you don’t know this.
00:03:55 That’s a lot of backstory.
00:03:58 You asked what happened.
00:04:01 I thought you’d like, you know, sum it up in a word or something.
00:04:06 Anyway, now you know.
00:04:11 So are you going to call him then?
00:04:15 I don’t think so.
00:04:17 Why not?
00:04:19 Because I don’t think its religion that he’s interested in.
00:04:25 I could’ve told you that.
00:04:50 I made you a cup.
00:04:59 Thanks. You’re amazing.
00:05:02 Listen.
00:05:05 I’m sorry.
00:05:11 I know I came on strong.
00:05:13 No, you were right.
00:05:19 But I could have been more patient.
00:05:22 I reacted too quickly.
00:05:26 I know you know what the right thing to do is.
00:05:31 I should have given you more time to talk it out.
00:05:38 I called Brother Davies
00:05:41 and gave him the background
00:05:43 and said, “If he’s really interested, he’ll have a study.”
00:05:49 Then I deleted Ollie’s number.
00:05:54 I knew it.
00:05:56 I knew you’d do the right thing.
00:05:59 Well, sometimes.
00:06:04 But I should’ve been more patient,
00:06:07 and I should have heard you out.
00:06:11 It’s just
00:06:13 not what I wanted to hear in the moment.
00:06:17 So we’re good?
00:06:19 Always.
00:06:22 Now, no more apologizing until I finish this coffee;
00:06:25 it’s too painful.
00:06:31 It’s so nice.
