00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re late!

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:43.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “You’re late.”

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:19.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
You work here now?

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:23.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, just a—
Just a few weeks.

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:26.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
You look great.

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, what can I get you?

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried texting, you know,

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:38.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
after you ended it.

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chai latte, that was your favorite.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, you were my favorite.

00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:00.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ollie, you know why I had to . . .

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:03.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:09.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I want to study your religion.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why I texted.

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:18.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I got a new phone, and I didn’t—
I didn’t see them.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, but how about I leave you my number,

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can meet up.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:33.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s when you walked away.

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:35.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell me you walked away.

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave me his number.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:45.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade!

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said he wants to study.

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:50.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he wants to study you.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:53.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t read hearts.

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:56.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I can read yours.

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:03.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was sweet,

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if he wants to know the truth . . .

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:12.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
I— 
I can’t even believe this.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it say?

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says low battery.

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:27.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not that,
this—2 Corinthians 6:14.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not become unevenly yoked
with unbelievers.”

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no yoking.
I haven’t yoked.

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this opens the door to the yoke.

00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:41.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not stupid!

00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:43.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
You act like I don’t know this.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:46.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.
You act like you don’t know this.

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a lot of backstory.

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:00.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
You asked what happened.

00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:05.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought you’d like, you know,
sum it up in a word or something.

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:08.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyway, now you know.

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:14.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
So are you going to call him then?

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:17.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think so.

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:23.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because I don’t think its religion
that he’s interested in.

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:27.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could’ve told you that.

00:04:50.811 --> 00:04:52.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made you a cup.

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.
You’re amazing.

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:04.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:07.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know I came on strong.

00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:15.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you were right.

00:05:19.047 --> 00:05:20.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I could have been more patient.

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:24.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
I reacted too quickly.

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:29.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you know
what the right thing to do is.

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:34.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should have given you
more time to talk it out.

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:41.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
I called Brother Davies

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:43.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave him the background

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said, “If he’s really interested,
he’ll have a study.”

00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:52.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I deleted Ollie’s number.

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:56.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew it.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew you’d do the right thing.

00:05:59.463 --> 00:06:01.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, sometimes.

00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:06.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I should’ve been more patient,

00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:09.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I should have heard you out.

00:06:11.183 --> 00:06:13.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just

00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:15.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
not what I wanted to hear
in the moment.

00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:19.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re good?

00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:20.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always.

00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:25.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, no more apologizing
until I finish this coffee;

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:27.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s too painful.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:32.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so nice.
