Many people feel that it takes blind faith
to believe in God.

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:20.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
They say that they only believe
in what they can see.

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:33.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
And often what they see is human suffering.

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
God, they cannot see.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If God is real,’ they ask,

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘why do bad things happen to good people?’

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:57.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does believing in God
make a person gullible or naive?

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:04.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 11:1, the Bible says:

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:09.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faith is . . .
the evident demonstration of realities

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are not seen.”

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The evident demonstration of”
God’s existence

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
is all around us.

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of it we can see,

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some of it we can’t.

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:33.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, our sun emits ultraviolet rays.

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are we protected
from their harmful effects?

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our earth has a protective shield

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:43.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a layer of ozone gas that filters out 

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of the harmful radiation.

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:49.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the radiation increases,

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
so does the protective ozone.

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s reasonable to ask:

00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there an intelligence
behind the earth’s processes

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the things we observe in nature?

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:07.690 line:10% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 3:4,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.358 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Bible says:

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.986 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Every house is constructed by someone,

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:14.780 line:10% position:50% align:center
“but the one who constructed

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.281 line:10% position:50% align:center
all things is God.”

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where there is design,

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:23.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a designer.

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:26.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t that same logic
apply to our complex earth?

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if you can accept
the possibility of a Creator,

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:38.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might wonder,

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:40.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How do we explain suffering?’

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:46.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you see a house in ruins,

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:50.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you conclude that it had no builder?

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:53.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or could there be
a more plausible explanation?

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why deny God’s existence
because of suffering?

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:05.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, let your questions
lead to further investigation.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
