00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life was simple—I remember.

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:07.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am Jeson, and I am deaf.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up with this disability was hard.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was younger,
I saw people laughing

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and families showing affection.

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:20.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just walked around the neighborhood

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and observed what was going on around me.

00:00:24.128 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw them walking and talking

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wondered what that was all about.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything was a mystery to me.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one day was a little different.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw children my age having fun,

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they wanted me to play with them.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to myself: ‘Me?

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:50.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t believe
they actually want me to be with them.’

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For once I felt welcomed,
and that was how we became

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best of friends.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:03.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Time went by so fast.

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:05.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We grew up spending time

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discovering new things together.

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was having so much fun with their company

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even questionable acts
seemed right to me.

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned how to smoke.

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They taught me how to drink alcohol

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to my heart’s content.

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like it was
the best time of our lives.

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:26.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought everything we did

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:29.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was how things were actually supposed to be.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day in a deaf search in our area,

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:50.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Witnesses found me.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was hesitant at first,
but they were very kind and friendly.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They educated me;

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they even taught me how to sign my name.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I studied the Bible with them.

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:17.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned different truths from the Bible

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:20.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and finally came to know Jehovah,
“the only true God.”

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned the things Jehovah liked
and disapproved of.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:31.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Bible study moved me
to reexamine the life I lived.

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that what I did before

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wasn’t pleasing to Jehovah.

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:39.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My love for Jehovah grew deeper,

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to attend Christian meetings,

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:49.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I met new friends in the congregation.

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:56.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible changed my life.

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I gave my all to Jehovah and decided

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate myself to him.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brought me nothing but real happiness.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I’m in full-time service

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and eagerly declaring the good news.

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was appointed

00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:23.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as a ministerial servant
in our congregation,

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was called to volunteer at Bethel too.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t have felt
genuine happiness in accomplishing

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:47.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these spiritual assignments
if I wasn’t in Jehovah’s organization.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:53.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To all the deaf ones out there

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:56.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that haven’t had the chance
to know Jehovah yet,

00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope and encourage you

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:01.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study the Bible with the Witnesses too.

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:02.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at me.

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:06.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before, I wasn’t able to read and write.

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:09.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realize that even if we can’t hear,

00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:14.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can still have a relationship
with the only true God.

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:16.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope you find
the same love and joy as I did

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under Jehovah’s loving hands.

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:22.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has helped me,

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:25.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for that I will always thank and love him

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:27.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all my heart.
