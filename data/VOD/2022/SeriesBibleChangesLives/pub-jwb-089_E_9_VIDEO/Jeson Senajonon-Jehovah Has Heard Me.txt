00:00:01 Life was simple—I remember.
00:00:04 I am Jeson, and I am deaf.
00:00:08 Growing up with this disability was hard.
00:00:12 When I was younger, I saw people laughing
00:00:14 and families showing affection.
00:00:18 I just walked around the neighborhood
00:00:20 and observed what was going on around me.
00:00:24 I saw them walking and talking
00:00:26 and wondered what that was all about.
00:00:29 Everything was a mystery to me.
00:00:33 But one day was a little different.
00:00:36 I saw children my age having fun,
00:00:39 and they wanted me to play with them.
00:00:43 I said to myself: ‘Me?
00:00:47 I can’t believe they actually want me to be with them.’
00:00:52 For once I felt welcomed, and that was how we became
00:00:56 the best of friends.
00:01:01 Time went by so fast.
00:01:03 We grew up spending time
00:01:05 and discovering new things together.
00:01:08 I was having so much fun with their company
00:01:10 that even questionable acts seemed right to me.
00:01:12 I learned how to smoke.
00:01:14 They taught me how to drink alcohol
00:01:16 to my heart’s content.
00:01:21 It felt like it was the best time of our lives.
00:01:23 I thought everything we did
00:01:26 was how things were actually supposed to be.
00:01:44 One day in a deaf search in our area,
00:01:48 the Witnesses found me.
00:01:51 I was hesitant at first, but they were very kind and friendly.
00:01:59 They educated me;
00:02:01 they even taught me how to sign my name.
00:02:08 Eventually, I studied the Bible with them.
00:02:13 I learned different truths from the Bible
00:02:17 and finally came to know Jehovah, “the only true God.”
00:02:22 I learned the things Jehovah liked and disapproved of.
00:02:26 Our Bible study moved me to reexamine the life I lived.
00:02:31 I realized that what I did before
00:02:33 wasn’t pleasing to Jehovah.
00:02:36 My love for Jehovah grew deeper,
00:02:39 and I knew exactly what I wanted to do.
00:02:44 I started to attend Christian meetings,
00:02:46 and I met new friends in the congregation.
00:02:53 The Bible changed my life.
00:02:56 I gave my all to Jehovah and decided
00:02:59 to dedicate myself to him.
00:03:02 It brought me nothing but real happiness.
00:03:11 Now I’m in full-time service
00:03:14 and eagerly declaring the good news.
00:03:18 I was appointed
00:03:20 to serve as a ministerial servant in our congregation,
00:03:26 and I was called to volunteer at Bethel too.
00:03:38 I wouldn’t have felt genuine happiness in accomplishing
00:03:42 these spiritual assignments if I wasn’t in Jehovah’s organization.
00:03:51 To all the deaf ones out there
00:03:53 that haven’t had the chance to know Jehovah yet,
00:03:56 I hope and encourage you
00:03:58 to study the Bible with the Witnesses too.
00:04:01 Look at me.
00:04:02 Before, I wasn’t able to read and write.
00:04:06 I realize that even if we can’t hear,
00:04:09 we can still have a relationship with the only true God.
00:04:14 I hope you find the same love and joy as I did
00:04:16 under Jehovah’s loving hands.
00:04:19 Jehovah has helped me,
00:04:22 and for that I will always thank and love him
00:04:25 with all my heart.
