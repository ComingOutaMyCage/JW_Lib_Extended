00:00:13 The Governing Body and the Writing Committee
00:00:15 take the responsibility of translating God’s Word very seriously.
00:00:20 As we will see in this report,
00:00:22 the Bible translation done by Jehovah’s people
00:00:25 has played a key role in making Jehovah’s Word
00:00:27 widely available in simple, clear language
00:00:31 that touches the hearts of sincere people.
00:00:34 In 2021, we reached an exciting milestone.
00:00:38 The New World Translation  is now available
00:00:41 in whole or in part
00:00:42 in well over 200 languages.
00:00:45 Let’s look at a few key landmarks
00:00:47 along the way.
00:00:50 In 1950, my mother and her family
00:00:53 were at Yankee Stadium
00:00:55 when Brother Knorr
00:00:56 released the New World Translation.
00:00:58 It was something unforgettable for them.
00:01:01 Years later, when I heard the recording of Brother Knorr’s talk,
00:01:05 I understood why.
00:01:07 But now by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,
00:01:12 I have the extreme pleasure of releasing
00:01:16 to the international Theocracy’s Increase Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:21 the New World Translation
00:01:23 of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:01:27 No wonder he said: ‘It gives me extreme pleasure
00:01:32 to release the New World Translation.’
00:01:35 Brother Knorr was overjoyed to release a translation
00:01:40 that was not tainted with false religion
00:01:42 and that restored Jehovah’s holy name
00:01:46 to its rightful place.
00:01:48 And it was translated by anointed brothers of Christ.
00:01:53 Back then, most English-speaking people
00:01:55 used the King James  Bible.
00:01:58 It used old-fashioned words
00:02:00 like “thee” and “thou” that were hard to understand.
00:02:04 The New World Translation was so much clearer.
00:02:07 And it restored Jehovah’s name to its rightful place
00:02:10 7,000 times.
00:02:14 The same need existed in other languages too.
00:02:17 So work began to produce the New World Translation
00:02:19 in additional languages.
00:02:21 It was a slow, painstaking process.
00:02:25 Some early editions
00:02:27 of the New World Translation
00:02:28 were taking over 20 years to complete.
00:02:32 But since 1989,
00:02:34 the Governing Body always assigns a team of translators
00:02:38 who encourage each other to keep moving
00:02:41 through the 66 books
00:02:43 and over 31,000 verses.
00:02:48 When a translator learns
00:02:49 that he has been assigned
00:02:50 to work with a Bible translation team,
00:02:53 he is overwhelmed.
00:02:55 One said: “I couldn’t sleep for many nights.
00:02:59 I even had nightmares.”
00:03:00 It is a tremendous challenge
00:03:03 to fully understand
00:03:05 the meaning of every part of the text
00:03:08 before he starts translation.
00:03:11 Imagine trying to replicate a food recipe,
00:03:15 but you do not have the original ingredients.
00:03:18 You need to use substitutes
00:03:21 but still create the same taste and flavor.
00:03:25 Translating the Bible is something like that.
00:03:28 You cannot use the original ingredients
00:03:31 —the Hebrew and Greek words.
00:03:33 However, using the words in your language,
00:03:36 you want to re-create the same meaning
00:03:39 and emotional impact as the original verse.
00:03:42 The Governing Body recognizes what a responsible project this is,
00:03:47 so they arrange specialized training
00:03:49 to guide translators
00:03:51 and to assure them of Jehovah’s support.
00:03:54 More than 130,000 questions
00:03:59 from Bible translators have been answered in the past 30 years or so.
00:04:04 And these answers are not only provided
00:04:06 to the teams that ask the questions
00:04:09 but to all Bible translation teams.
00:04:13 This approach made the translators’ work much easier,
00:04:16 but the focus on Bible translation was about to intensify.
00:04:21 The Governing Body became aware
00:04:23 of some difficult problems
00:04:24 that some of our brothers were facing,
00:04:26 particularly with certain language groups.
00:04:29 You had just one Bible
00:04:31 for a family or group or even for a congregation,
00:04:34 and they had to share that one Bible.
00:04:36 In addition to that, some languages did have
00:04:40 new translations of the Bible that were available,
00:04:43 but they not only took Jehovah’s name out
00:04:46 but they replaced it with the name of a local deity.
00:04:50 So back in 2004, the Governing Body decided
00:04:54 to expand Bible translation work
00:04:56 so that more and more languages could have the New World Translation.
00:05:01 With the Governing Body’s clear direction,
00:05:04 Bible translation picked up speed.
00:05:06 Then came the landmark 2013 annual meeting.
00:05:11 And we’re pleased to announce at this annual meeting
00:05:14 that the work on this revision recently was completed.
00:05:18 You don’t have to wait at all! Here it is!
00:05:20 The revised edition of the New World Translation.
00:05:30 We think you’re going to find that this application
00:05:33 is going to be the ideal digital companion
00:05:36 to the Bible that you now have in your hand.
00:05:41 The simpler 2013 English text
00:05:44 sets a pattern for translators
00:05:47 because it places greater emphasis on meaning rather than on words.
00:05:51 Let’s look at 1 Peter 5:2.
00:05:54 I’m going to read it
00:05:55 from the previous edition
00:05:56 of the New World Translation,
00:05:57 and on the screen you’ll see the revised version:
00:06:00 “Shepherd the flock of God in your care,
00:06:03 not under compulsion, but willingly.”
00:06:07 Did you notice anything different?
00:06:09 “Serving as overseers” has been added.
00:06:12 We never had those words in the New World Translation  before
00:06:15 because the word translated “serving as overseers”
00:06:19 didn’t appear in the Greek text that was used as the basis for it.
00:06:23 However, since then, an older copy of 1 Peter was uncovered,
00:06:27 and it does contain the word.
00:06:30 It appears that the word was removed
00:06:32 from some later manuscripts of the fourth century.
00:06:36 Why would anyone remove the word?
00:06:38 Scholars have suggested a possibility.
00:06:41 In verse 1, Peter addresses the elders,
00:06:44 and then in verse 2, he calls them overseers.
00:06:48 That proves that the same person can be both an elder and an overseer.
00:06:53 The Catholic church disagrees.
00:06:55 In the Catholic church, an elder is equated with a priest
00:06:59 and an overseer is much more important.
00:07:01 He’s equated with a bishop, and to them, a priest
00:07:05 —a lowly priest— can’t also be bishop.
00:07:08 So when the Catholic copyists came to verses 1 and 2,
00:07:11 they must have thought that the church couldn’t be wrong,
00:07:13 so the Bible must be wrong.
00:07:16 And they took it out.
00:07:18 To Jehovah’s people, if there’s a difference
00:07:21 between what we believe and what the Bible says,
00:07:24 we will change.
00:07:25 We leave the Bible alone.
00:07:27 When I think back to the very evening
00:07:29 when I realized
00:07:30 that I had been given the truth,
00:07:32 I recall thinking to myself,
00:07:35 ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses have the truth,
00:07:38 and so they must have the very best Bible translation.’
00:07:42 And so that was the first thing I asked for.
00:07:44 I wanted my own copy of the New World Translation.
00:07:48 And so now when I have the privilege to release a new language edition
00:07:52 of the New World Translation
00:07:54 and I see the joy on the faces of the friends,
00:07:57 I can connect directly to that because that’s exactly how I felt.
00:08:01 I just love releasing the New World Translation
00:08:04 in another language.
00:08:06 Sometimes it’s very exciting because the brothers don’t think they’re able
00:08:10 to even receive the printed copy
00:08:11 in time for the release.
00:08:13 In a couple of cases,
00:08:15 they received the shipment of Bibles
00:08:17 just the day before the release talk.
00:08:20 So you can imagine, the brothers were totally excited,
00:08:23 and then when they received it, that excitement was really enhanced.
00:08:28 The day I had the privilege to release the Ewe New World Translation  in Ghana,
00:08:33 we traveled to the Assembly Hall for the program.
00:08:36 As we neared the Assembly Hall,
00:08:38 here there were many people with little stands alongside the road
00:08:42 trying to sell things to the brothers.
00:08:44 Many were selling Bibles
00:08:46 because our brothers did not have the New World Translation.
00:08:50 It made me so happy
00:08:52 to think that this was the last day
00:08:55 our brothers would be forced to buy an inferior-quality Bible translation.
00:09:00 Now they would have the New World Translation.
00:09:06 Every copy of the New World Translation that is printed or downloaded
00:09:10 has the potential to change someone’s life.
00:09:14 Our preaching and teaching work is more important than ever.
00:09:18 Jehovah provides the tools we need.
00:09:21 As we use them, we make Bible truths
00:09:24 widely available in hundreds of languages.
00:09:27 We help people to understand the truth
00:09:29 and let it reach their hearts.
00:09:32 “Thus in a mighty way,
00:09:34 the word of Jehovah [keeps] growing and prevailing.”
