00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:15.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
and the Writing Committee

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
take the responsibility
of translating God’s Word very seriously.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we will see in this report,

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:25.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible translation
done by Jehovah’s people

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
has played a key role
in making Jehovah’s Word

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
widely available in simple, clear language

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that touches the hearts of sincere people.

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.559 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 2021, we reached an exciting milestone.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.103 line:10% position:50% align:center
The <i>New World Translation</i>  is now available

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:42.521 line:10% position:50% align:center
in whole or in part

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.649 line:10% position:50% align:center
in well over 200 languages.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.484 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at a few key landmarks

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:48.819 line:10% position:50% align:center
along the way.

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:53.365 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 1950, my mother and her family

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:55.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
were at Yankee Stadium

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:56.076 line:10% position:50% align:center
when Brother Knorr

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.287 line:10% position:50% align:center
released the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:01.373 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was something unforgettable for them.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years later, when I heard
the recording of Brother Knorr’s talk,

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understood why.

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:12.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:16.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have the extreme pleasure of releasing

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the international Theocracy’s Increase
Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:26.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</i>

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:32.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder he said:
‘It gives me extreme pleasure

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
to release the <i>New World Translation.’</i>

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:40.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr was overjoyed
to release a translation

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was not tainted with false religion

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.126 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that restored Jehovah’s holy name

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.379 line:10% position:50% align:center
to its rightful place.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was translated
by anointed brothers of Christ.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.970 line:10% position:50% align:center
Back then, most English-speaking people

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.347 line:10% position:50% align:center
used the <i>King James</i>  Bible.

00:01:58.347 --> 00:02:00.349 line:10% position:50% align:center
It used old-fashioned words

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
like “thee” and “thou”
that were hard to understand.

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>New World Translation</i>
was so much clearer.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:10.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it restored Jehovah’s name
to its rightful place

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:13.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
7,000 times.

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same need existed
in other languages too.

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:19.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
So work began
to produce the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:21.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
in additional languages.

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a slow, painstaking process.

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.334 line:10% position:50% align:center
Some early editions

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:28.669 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:32.339 line:10% position:50% align:center
were taking over 20 years to complete.

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
But since 1989,

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:38.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body
always assigns a team of translators

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
who encourage each other to keep moving

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the 66 books

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 31,000 verses.

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:49.314 line:10% position:50% align:center
When a translator learns

00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:50.816 line:10% position:50% align:center
that he has been assigned

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:53.736 line:10% position:50% align:center
to work with a Bible translation team,

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:55.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is overwhelmed.

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:59.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
One said: “I couldn’t sleep for many nights.

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
I even had nightmares.”

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:03.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is a tremendous challenge

00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:05.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fully understand

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
the meaning of every part of the text

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
before he starts translation.

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:15.799 line:10% position:50% align:center
Imagine trying to replicate a food recipe,

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you do not have the original ingredients.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need to use substitutes

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:25.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
but still create the same taste and flavor.

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:28.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Translating the Bible is something like that.

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
You cannot use the original ingredients

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:33.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Hebrew and Greek words.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:36.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, using the words in your language,

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:39.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
you want to re-create the same meaning

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:42.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
and emotional impact as the original verse.

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:47.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body recognizes
what a responsible project this is,

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they arrange specialized training

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:51.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
to guide translators

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:54.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to assure them of Jehovah’s support.

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 130,000 questions

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:04.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Bible translators have been answered
in the past 30 years or so.

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:06.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these answers are not only provided

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the teams that ask the questions

00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to all Bible translation teams.

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:16.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
This approach made
the translators’ work much easier,

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:21.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the focus on Bible translation
was about to intensify.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.033 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body became aware

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.785 line:10% position:50% align:center
of some difficult problems

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:26.829 line:10% position:50% align:center
that some of our brothers were facing,

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:29.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly with certain language groups.

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:31.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
You had just one Bible

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:34.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a family or group
or even for a congregation,

00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:36.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had to share that one Bible.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to that,
some languages did have

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:43.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
new translations of the Bible
that were available,

00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:46.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they not only took Jehovah’s name out

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:50.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they replaced it
with the name of a local deity.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
So back in 2004,
the Governing Body decided

00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:56.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expand Bible translation work

00:04:56.733 --> 00:05:00.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that more and more languages
could have the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:04.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the Governing Body’s clear direction,

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:06.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible translation picked up speed.

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:11.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then came
the landmark 2013 annual meeting.

00:05:11.874 --> 00:05:14.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re pleased to announce
at this annual meeting

00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:18.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the work
on this revision recently was completed.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t have to wait at all!
Here it is!

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:24.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
The revised edition
of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think you’re going to find
that this application

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:36.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be
the ideal digital companion

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Bible
that you now have in your hand.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
The simpler 2013 English text

00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:47.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
sets a pattern for translators

00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:51.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it places greater emphasis
on meaning rather than on words.

00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:54.249 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at 1 Peter 5:2.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:55.250 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’m going to read it

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.418 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the previous edition

00:05:56.418 --> 00:05:57.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on the screen
you’ll see the revised version:

00:06:00.505 --> 00:06:03.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Shepherd the flock of God in your care,

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:06.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
not under compulsion, but willingly.”

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:09.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice anything different?

00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:12.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Serving as overseers” has been added.

00:06:12.017 --> 00:06:15.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never had those words
in the <i>New World Translation</i>  before

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:19.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the word
translated “serving as overseers”

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:22.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t appear in the Greek text
that was used as the basis for it.

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:27.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, since then, an older copy
of 1 Peter was uncovered,

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it does contain the word.

00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:32.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
It appears that the word was removed

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:35.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
from some later manuscripts
of the fourth century.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would anyone remove the word?

00:06:38.502 --> 00:06:41.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Scholars have suggested a possibility.

00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:44.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 1, Peter addresses the elders,

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:48.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then in verse 2, he calls them overseers.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:53.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
That proves that the same person
can be both an elder and an overseer.

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:55.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Catholic church disagrees.

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:59.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Catholic church,
an elder is equated with a priest

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:01.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an overseer is much more important.

00:07:01.942 --> 00:07:05.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s equated with a bishop,
and to them, a priest

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a lowly priest—
can’t also be bishop.

00:07:08.115 --> 00:07:11.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the Catholic copyists
came to verses 1 and 2,

00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:13.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
they must have thought
that the church couldn’t be wrong,

00:07:13.954 --> 00:07:16.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the Bible must be wrong.

00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:18.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they took it out.

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:21.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
To Jehovah’s people,
if there’s a difference

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:24.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
between what we believe
and what the Bible says,

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:25.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will change.

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:27.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
We leave the Bible alone.

00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.928 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I think back to the very evening

00:07:29.928 --> 00:07:30.929 line:10% position:50% align:center
when I realized

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:32.973 line:10% position:50% align:center
that I had been given the truth,

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:35.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall thinking to myself,

00:07:35.517 --> 00:07:38.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah’s Witnesses have the truth,

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:42.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so they must have
the very best Bible translation.’

00:07:42.774 --> 00:07:44.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so that was the first thing I asked for.

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:48.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted my own copy
of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:52.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so now when I have the privilege
to release a new language edition

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:07:54.286 --> 00:07:57.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I see the joy
on the faces of the friends,

00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:01.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can connect directly to that
because that’s exactly how I felt.

00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:04.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just love releasing
the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:08:04.087 --> 00:08:06.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
in another language.

00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:10.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes it’s very exciting
because the brothers don’t think they’re able

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
to even receive the printed copy

00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:13.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
in time for the release.

00:08:13.472 --> 00:08:15.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a couple of cases,

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
they received the shipment of Bibles

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:19.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
just the day before the release talk.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you can imagine,
the brothers were totally excited,

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then when they received it,
that excitement was really enhanced.

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:33.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day I had the privilege to release
the Ewe <i>New World Translation</i>  in Ghana,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
we traveled to the Assembly Hall
for the program.

00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we neared the Assembly Hall,

00:08:38.413 --> 00:08:42.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
here there were many people
with little stands alongside the road

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:44.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to sell things to the brothers.

00:08:44.252 --> 00:08:46.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many were selling Bibles

00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:50.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our brothers
did not have the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made me so happy

00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:55.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think that this was the last day

00:08:55.097 --> 00:09:00.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers would be forced to buy
an inferior-quality Bible translation.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now they would have
the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:10.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every copy of the <i>New World Translation</i>
that is printed or downloaded

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:12.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the potential to change someone’s life.

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:17.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our preaching and teaching work
is more important than ever.

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:20.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provides the tools we need.

00:09:21.498 --> 00:09:24.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we use them, we make Bible truths

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:27.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
widely available in hundreds of languages.

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:29.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
We help people to understand the truth

00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:32.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let it reach their hearts.

00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:34.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thus in a mighty way,

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:37.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
the word of Jehovah
[keeps] growing and prevailing.”
