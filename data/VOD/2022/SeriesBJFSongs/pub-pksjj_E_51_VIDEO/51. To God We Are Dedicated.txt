00:00:10 To Christ, by our God, Jehovah, we have been drawn
00:00:19 To be his disciples from now on.
00:00:29 From Jehovah’s lofty throne, How the light of truth has shone.
00:00:38 In our hearts, our faith has grown; Our lives we vow to disown.
00:00:47 To God we are dedicated; This is our choice.
00:00:57 In him and in Jesus we now rejoice.
00:01:06 In prayer we have come before Jehovah to say
00:01:16 We’ll serve him forever and obey.
00:01:25 It’s a joy beyond compare, One that we are glad to share,
00:01:35 As Jehovah’s name we bear, And Kingdom truth we declare.
00:01:46 To God we are dedicated; This is our choice.
00:01:56 In him and in Jesus we now rejoice.
