To Christ, by our God, Jehovah,
we have been drawn

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be his disciples
from now on.

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
From Jehovah’s lofty throne,
How the light of truth has shone.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our hearts, our faith has grown;
Our lives we vow to disown.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:57.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
To God we are dedicated;
This is our choice.

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:05.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
In him and in Jesus
we now rejoice.

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
In prayer we have come
before Jehovah to say

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll serve him forever
and obey.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a joy beyond compare,
One that we are glad to share,

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:44.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s name we bear,
And Kingdom truth we declare.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:56.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
To God we are dedicated;
This is our choice.

00:01:56.136 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
In him and in Jesus
we now rejoice.
