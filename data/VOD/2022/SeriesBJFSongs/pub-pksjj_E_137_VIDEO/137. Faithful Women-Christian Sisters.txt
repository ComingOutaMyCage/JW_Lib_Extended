00:00:10 Sarah and Esther, Mary, Ruth, and others—
00:00:20 All these were capable women, loyal wives.
00:00:30 Godly devotion was foremost in their lives.
00:00:38 They were faithful women, ones we know by name.
00:00:48 There were others favored by Jehovah;
00:00:53 Nameless in the record, their faith was just the same.
00:01:07 Goodness and courage, loyal love and kindness—
00:01:16 Lovable qualities in all humankind,
00:01:25 Virtues these excellent women bring to mind.
00:01:34 They were fine examples we appreciate.
00:01:43 In the same way now our Christian sisters
00:01:48 Show a faithful spirit we all can imitate.
00:02:03 Mothers and daughters, sisters, wives, and widows,
00:02:12 Willingly laboring, glad to do your part.
00:02:21 Modest your bearing, submissive is your heart,
00:02:30 Having God’s approval, may you never fear.
00:02:38 Christian sisters, may Jehovah keep you
00:02:43 Firm in your conviction, your prize is drawing near.
