00:00:23 For much too long, I’ve held it in. It weighs me down and clouds my sight.
00:00:33 This grudge I’ve held since I was hurt, I’ve held it close.
00:00:42 That’s just not right. That’s never right.
00:00:45 But now it’s time to find a way, To find a way to let it go,
00:00:56 To just forgive and make amends, Be close again, be friends again.
00:01:20 Whatever hurt I might forgive, Whatever wrong that I let go,
00:01:31 I realize they don’t compare With God’s free gift—the love he shows.
00:01:41 What love he shows!
00:01:43 But now it’s time to find a way, To find a way to let it go,
00:01:54 To just forgive and make amends, Be close again, be friends again.
00:02:05 I’ll make the first move. I won’t delay, not one more day.
00:02:16 It’s time for both of us To be OK.
00:02:23 We’ll be OK.
00:02:50 Jehovah loves the two of us. He wants to see our friendship grow.
00:03:00 When I forgive, my heart is light. So I’ll forgive and let it go.
00:03:11 Just let it go.
00:03:13 But now it’s time to find a way, To find a way to let it go,
00:03:24 To just forgive and make amends, Be close again, be friends again,
00:03:34 Be close again, be friends again.
00:03:40 I’ll make the first move.
