For much too long, I’ve held it in.
It weighs me down and clouds my sight.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
This grudge I’ve held since I was hurt,
I’ve held it close.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:45.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s just not right.
That’s never right.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:56.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now it’s time to find a way,
To find a way to let it go,

00:00:56.952 --> 00:01:08.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
To just forgive and make amends,
Be close again, be friends again.

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:31.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever hurt I might forgive,
Whatever wrong that I let go,

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:41.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realize they don’t compare
With God’s free gift—the love he shows.

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:43.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
What love he shows!

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:54.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now it’s time to find a way,
To find a way to let it go,

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:05.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
To just forgive and make amends,
Be close again, be friends again.

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll make the first move.
I won’t delay, not one more day.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:23.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s time for both of us
To be OK.

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:27.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be OK.

00:02:50.315 --> 00:03:00.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves the two of us.
He wants to see our friendship grow.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:11.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I forgive, my heart is light.
So I’ll forgive and let it go.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just let it go.

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:24.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now it’s time to find a way,
To find a way to let it go,

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:34.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
To just forgive and make amends,
Be close again, be friends again,

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be close again, be friends again.

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:46.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll make the first move.
