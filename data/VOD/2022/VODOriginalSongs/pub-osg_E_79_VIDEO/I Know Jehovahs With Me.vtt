I woke up this morning and dressed for the day.
I prayed to Jehovah and went on my way.

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:35.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was told not to preach, but I cannot bend.
God is my Ruler rather than men.

As I get back home and think about this day,
That man on the bench had so much to say.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:27.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I pray that I’ll see him again there soon.
I know he’d feel better if he had the truth.

Like a fire that’s burning deep in my heart,
These words I will speak; I’ll do my part.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll spread his name the best that I can,
And I will keep going right down to the end.

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:16.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing my brothers are fighting this fight,
I’ll strengthen my faith, keep it alive.

Trusting Jehovah, his praises I’ll sing,
Knowing the new world he soon will bring.

As I lay my head down to sleep tonight,
I thank Jehovah and turn out the light.

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:45.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
What tomorrow may bring, I do not know,
But I know that I won’t face it alone.

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:54.338 line:90% position:50% align:center

so I will not fear.
