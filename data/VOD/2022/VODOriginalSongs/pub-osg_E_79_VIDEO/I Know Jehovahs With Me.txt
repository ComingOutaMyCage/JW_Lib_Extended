00:00:08 I woke up this morning and dressed for the day. I prayed to Jehovah and went on my way.
00:00:22 I was told not to preach, but I cannot bend. God is my Ruler rather than men.
00:00:35 And like the breeze blowing out in the field, I feel peace right here.
00:00:44 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:00:52 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:01:00 As I get back home and think about this day, That man on the bench had so much to say.
00:01:14 So I pray that I’ll see him again there soon. I know he’d feel better if he had the truth.
00:01:27 And like the breeze blowing out in the field, I feel peace right here.
00:01:36 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:01:44 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:01:52 Like a fire that’s burning deep in my heart, These words I will speak; I’ll do my part.
00:02:01 I’ll spread his name the best that I can, And I will keep going right down to the end.
00:02:08 Knowing my brothers are fighting this fight, I’ll strengthen my faith, keep it alive.
00:02:16 Trusting Jehovah, his praises I’ll sing, Knowing the new world he soon will bring.
00:03:18 As I lay my head down to sleep tonight, I thank Jehovah and turn out the light.
00:03:31 What tomorrow may bring, I do not know, But I know that I won’t face it alone.
00:03:45 And like the breeze blowing out in the field, I feel peace right here.
00:03:54 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:04:02 I know Jehovah’s with me, so I will not fear.
