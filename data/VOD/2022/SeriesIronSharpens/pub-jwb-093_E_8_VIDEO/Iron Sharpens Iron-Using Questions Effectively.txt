00:00:01 Hi. I’m Armando.
00:00:03 Welcome to “Iron Sharpens Iron.”
00:00:15 We’ve all been there.
00:00:17 We’re out in the ministry
00:00:19 trying to start conversations with people.
00:00:23 But for many of us, it’s not that easy.
00:00:28 Just the idea of talking to a stranger
00:00:30 can be intimidating.
00:00:33 Personally, I’m not someone who finds it easy
00:00:37 to just walk up to a stranger and start a conversation.
00:00:42 But with some effort and time,
00:00:45 I’ve learned a few methods that have helped me to overcome my fears.
00:00:49 Today, we’re going to concentrate on just one of them:
00:00:53 using questions to start
00:00:55 and maintain a conversation.
00:00:59 And perhaps by the time we’re done, you’ll realize like I have
00:01:02 that it’s not as difficult as it seems.
00:01:08 Hi, there.
00:01:08 Ah, well, we’re asking our neighbors a question,
00:01:12 and we’d like to know your opinion.
00:01:15 Have you ever asked yourself what we need to do to have a happy family?
00:01:20 No. I’m not married.
00:01:22 Oh, ah, OK.
00:01:25 Well, we have this brochure that talks about . . .
00:01:29 OK, three things:
00:01:32 First, the brother was nervous.
00:01:35 When we’re nervous, we make the person we’re speaking with nervous too.
00:01:40 Of course, it’s difficult not to be nervous,
00:01:43 but if we concentrate too much on how we feel,
00:01:47 we can forget that what we want to do
00:01:50 is simply to start a conversation.
00:01:52 There’s no pressure; just keep it casual.
00:01:57 Second, yes, the brother did ask a question,
00:02:02 but the question was irrelevant to the householder.
00:02:06 It’s usually better to ask something
00:02:08 that will encourage the person to participate in the conversation
00:02:12 but will also help us to discern what interests them.
00:02:17 Third, one of the biggest fears we have is,
00:02:21 What if my question doesn’t connect with them?
00:02:24 This can throw us off.
00:02:26 We feel like we have nowhere to go.
00:02:29 It would have been better to have a flexible approach
00:02:32 that would allow us to react according to what the person says.
00:02:37 Let’s try it again,
00:02:39 but this time let’s approach the situation a little differently.
00:02:43 In the first few pages of our Bible,
00:02:46 there are 20 questions that we can use in the ministry.
00:02:50 Why not start familiarizing ourselves with them?
00:02:54 We can choose one or two subjects that we like
00:02:57 so that we will be ready when an opportunity arises.
00:03:00 Let’s see how our brother does this in the next demonstration.
00:03:05 Hi, there.
00:03:06 We’re asking our neighbors a question, and we’d love to know your opinion.
00:03:10 What would you say is something that causes you a lot of stress?
00:03:14 Personally, I worry a lot about money and paying all my bills.
00:03:19 Yeah, I think that’s the case for many of us.
00:03:22 Did you know that the Bible explains something
00:03:25 that can help us specifically with that anxiety?
00:03:28 Really?
00:03:29 In the front of my Bible, there are 20 questions that many of us ask
00:03:34 and that the Bible answers.
00:03:36 Notice question 16,
00:03:39 “How can you cope with anxiety?”
00:03:43 Notice what this scripture says in Proverbs 21:5:
00:03:47 “The plans of the diligent . . .”
00:03:50 Much better, right?
00:03:52 Did you notice that when the person answered,
00:03:54 the brother simply opened his Bible to the questions
00:03:58 and found a scripture that allowed him to continue the conversation?
00:04:02 And he didn’t try to hide what he was doing.
00:04:05 He showed the person the tool he was using.
00:04:08 He felt confident that however the person responded,
00:04:11 he would be able to find a useful scripture
00:04:14 that would keep the conversation moving.
00:04:16 So that went pretty well,
00:04:19 but maybe you’re thinking,
00:04:22 ‘It almost never happens like that for me.’
00:04:26 Perhaps in our case,
00:04:30 it’s more like this.
00:04:34 Hi, there.
00:04:35 We’re asking our neighbors a question, and we’d love to know your opinion.
00:04:39 What would you say is something that causes you a lot of stress?
00:04:43 People coming to my door and asking me questions.
00:04:46 I understand.
00:04:48 I’m not a fan of that myself.
00:04:51 But have you ever wondered why we do this?
00:04:56 Now, at this point, the householder may shut down the conversation completely.
00:05:00 And that’s fine. We’re not trying to pressure anyone into talking.
00:05:04 But that second question that the publisher asked
00:05:07 and the fact that he was calm, that he was relaxed,
00:05:11 and that he was not taking himself too seriously
00:05:14 —all of that can open the door for the conversation to continue.
00:05:19 To sum up, remember:
00:05:22 First, be calm and relaxed.
00:05:27 We’re just trying to start a conversation.
00:05:30 Smile; be friendly.
00:05:33 Second, ask a question that brings a person into the conversation
00:05:38 and allows us to discover what interests them.
00:05:43 And third, don’t be nervous about where the conversation could lead.
00:05:49 With our 20 questions for the ministry,
00:05:52 we can be sure that we’ll find an appropriate text
00:05:55 that will keep the conversation directed toward spiritual matters.
00:06:01 This is one of the methods that has helped me,
00:06:03 and I hope that it can help you too
00:06:06 as you see for yourself how “iron sharpens iron.”
