00:00:01.897 --> 00:00:03.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi. I’m Armando.

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:06.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.” </i>

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.329 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’ve all been there.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.331 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re out in the ministry

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.834 line:10% position:50% align:center
trying to start conversations with people.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:27.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for many of us, it’s not that easy.

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just the idea of talking to a stranger

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be intimidating.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:37.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, I’m not someone who finds it easy

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:40.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just walk up to a stranger
and start a conversation.

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with some effort and time,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned a few methods
that have helped me to overcome my fears.

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:53.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we’re going to concentrate
on just one of them:

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
using questions to start

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:59.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain a conversation.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps by the time we’re done,
you’ll realize like I have

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s not as difficult as it seems.

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:08.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, there.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:12.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, well, we’re asking
our neighbors a question,

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’d like to know your opinion.

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:20.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever asked yourself
what we need to do to have a happy family?

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
No. I’m not married.

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:25.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, ah, OK.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have this brochure
that talks about . . .

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, three things:

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the brother was nervous.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:39.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re nervous, we make
the person we’re speaking with nervous too.

00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:43.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, it’s difficult not to be nervous,

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:47.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if we concentrate too much
on how we feel,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can forget that what we want to do

00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:52.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
is simply to start a conversation.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no pressure; just keep it casual.

00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, yes, the brother did ask a question,

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the question was irrelevant
to the householder.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s usually better to ask something

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:12.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will encourage the person
to participate in the conversation

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
but will also help us to discern
what interests them.

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:21.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, one of the biggest fears we have is,

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if my question
doesn’t connect with them?

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can throw us off.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel like we have nowhere to go.

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would have been better
to have a flexible approach

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:36.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would allow us to react
according to what the person says.

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:39.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s try it again,

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:43.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this time let’s approach the situation
a little differently.

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first few pages of our Bible,

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:50.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are 20 questions
that we can use in the ministry.

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:54.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not start familiarizing ourselves
with them?

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:57.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can choose
one or two subjects that we like

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:00.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we will be ready
when an opportunity arises.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how our brother does this
in the next demonstration.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, there.

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:10.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re asking our neighbors a question,
and we’d love to know your opinion.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:14.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you say is something
that causes you a lot of stress?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, I worry a lot about money
and paying all my bills.

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:22.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think that’s the case for many of us.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:25.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know
that the Bible explains something

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help us specifically
with that anxiety?

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:29.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:34.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the front of my Bible,
there are 20 questions that many of us ask

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the Bible answers.

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:39.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice question 16,

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How can you cope with anxiety?”

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:47.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what this scripture says
in Proverbs 21:5:

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The plans of the diligent . . .”

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:52.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Much better, right?

00:03:52.294 --> 00:03:54.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that when the person answered,

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:58.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother simply opened his Bible
to the questions

00:03:58.258 --> 00:04:02.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and found a scripture that allowed him
to continue the conversation?

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he didn’t try to hide what he was doing.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed the person the tool he was using.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felt confident
that however the person responded,

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:14.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would be able to find a useful scripture

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:16.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would keep the conversation moving.

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:19.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that went pretty well,

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:22.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maybe you’re thinking,

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It almost never happens like that for me.’

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:30.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps in our case,

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s more like this.

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:35.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, there.

00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:39.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re asking our neighbors a question,
and we’d love to know your opinion.

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:43.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you say is something
that causes you a lot of stress?

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:46.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
People coming to my door
and asking me questions.

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:48.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not a fan of that myself.

00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you ever wondered why we do this?

00:04:56.316 --> 00:05:00.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at this point, the householder
may shut down the conversation completely.

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s fine. We’re not trying to pressure
anyone into talking.

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:07.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that second question
that the publisher asked

00:05:07.953 --> 00:05:11.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fact that he was calm,
that he was relaxed,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he was not taking himself
too seriously

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of that can open the door
for the conversation to continue.

00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:22.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
To sum up, remember:

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:27.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, be calm and relaxed.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re just trying to start a conversation.

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:32.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Smile; be friendly.

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:38.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, ask a question
that brings a person into the conversation

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:42.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allows us to discover
what interests them.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, don’t be nervous
about where the conversation could lead.

00:05:49.286 --> 00:05:52.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our 20 questions for the ministry,

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be sure
that we’ll find an appropriate text

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:59.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will keep the conversation
directed toward spiritual matters.

00:06:01.256 --> 00:06:03.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is one of the methods
that has helped me,

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:06.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I hope that it can help you too

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:10.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you see for yourself
how “iron sharpens iron.”
