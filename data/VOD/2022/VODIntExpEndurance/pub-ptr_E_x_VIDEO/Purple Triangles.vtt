00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
The locals call this Boden’s Pool,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the Germanic pagan god

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was credited with creating earth,
sky, man, and woman.

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:34.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
The water is the source of the River Lippe,

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
which flows
from the spa town of Bad Lippspringe

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:40.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the Rhine
and the industrial areas of the Ruhr Valley.

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:43.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today,
it’s a peaceful and prosperous little town,

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:45.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as it was 60 years ago

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Franz and Hilda Kusserow
arrived here with their 11 children.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:55.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
What began as a peaceful idyll
became an epic battle between good and evil,

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the Kusserows
defied Hitler and the Nazi regime.

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:02.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Franz and Hilda Kusserow
were married in 1911,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
three years before the Great War
that traumatized Europe.

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Franz Kusserow fought for his country,
but his life and beliefs were transformed.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kusserows’ story
has been lovingly chronicled

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:22.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the eldest of the 11 children,
Annemarie, now age 78.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Annemarie’s parents were born

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a comfortably-off Protestant environment,

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the First World War

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the chance meeting
with a Jehovah’s Witness

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
dramatically changed their lives.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:42.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Franz, a post-office clerk,
and Hilda, a former schoolteacher,

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
became full-time missionaries

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the International Bible Students Association.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:52.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
They came to this house
on the outskirts of Bad Lippspringe

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set up congregations in North Westphalia.

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:58.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
No Kusserows live here today,

00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:02.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when members of the family do return,
there are vivid memories.

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:05.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Magdalena is the Kusserow’s fourth daughter.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are your early memories of this house?

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.942 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, it was so nice.

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:11.860 line:10% position:50% align:center
We played here in the garden,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.822 line:10% position:50% align:center
in this little place, and then there also.

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:16.156 line:10% position:50% align:center
We had some trees

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.742 line:10% position:50% align:center
with apples and some fruit.

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had some potatoes,

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
salad, and different things.

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
We played.
We danced together.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:36.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we took some flowers
and made a ring on the head.

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we went down with the geese to the river

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:48.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to the river to bring the geese.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have to—

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
They could . . .

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:52.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Swim?

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:53.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Swim also, yes.

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:55.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we swam also.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:56.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
You took the geese for a swim?

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:58.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:00.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on the way,
they took the grass, and they ate.

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we had much fun.

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:10.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a long time since I was here

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:13.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not since 1939, I think.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
The door seemed bigger then.

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hans-Werner, now 63,
was the Kusserows’ tenth child.

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:29.354 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was a very happy time,

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:31.982 line:10% position:50% align:center
especially as I had so many brothers and sisters.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:35.319 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everything was happy until I went to school.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was bad, of course.

00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:41.658 line:10% position:50% align:center
Every day when children went to school,

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:44.453 line:10% position:50% align:center
they thought in advance:

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:46.038 line:10% position:50% align:center
‘What will happen today?

00:03:46.038 --> 00:03:47.456 line:10% position:50% align:center
What will happen today?’

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:51.752 line:10% position:50% align:center
I remember many things.

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:54.046 line:10% position:50% align:center
I remember how strong we were,

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:56.173 line:10% position:50% align:center
how we didn’t salute the flag,

00:03:56.173 --> 00:03:58.175 line:10% position:50% align:center
how we wouldn’t say “Heil Hitler,”

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:02.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we acted a bit differently
from other pupils.

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:05.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some days were hard.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
The teacher was like a devil.

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:09.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
She took my hand, and she said:

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!”
and beat me.

00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:14.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you say you were frightened
when they would hit you?

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:16.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you never say “Heil Hitler”?

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:19.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, we never said it
because my father said:

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look, ‘Heil Hitler’ means

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that the salvation comes from Hitler.

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As we learned from the Bible,

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:33.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
the heil—the salvation—
comes by Jesus Christ.”

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kusserows’ house
was known as “The Golden Age.”

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:42.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
A huge sign advertising
the Jehovah’s Witness magazine

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
was emblazoned in gold letters
outside their home.

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inside, the parents gave the children
their love and their time,

00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:53.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they taught the Bible and music

00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:56.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
—lessons which would have
a lifetime’s impact.

00:05:46.074 --> 00:05:48.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kusserows, then and now,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
firmly believed
the creed of the Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:53.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that our world, now influenced by Satan,

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:56.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
will soon be transformed
into the Thousand Year Reign of Christ

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:58.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
promised in the Bible.

00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:07.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
The evil will die,

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
while the good and faithful
will be physically reborn into Paradise.

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:39.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was from morning to evening

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:43.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
visiting people who liked to know
what the Bible says

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:46.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the preaching work, or missionary work.

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:49.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
They liked to receive me.

00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:53.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Much of the literature distributed
by the Kusserows

00:06:53.684 --> 00:06:56.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
came from the Witnesses’ headquarters
in New York.

00:06:56.687 --> 00:07:01.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Germany, the Witnesses were
a very small sect of just 20,000 people,

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:05.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet Hitler saw the movement
as a rival ideology to the Nazis.

00:07:05.737 --> 00:07:09.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he set out to seize their literature
and wreck the organization.

00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:13.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
So where were the books and the literature?
Where were they hidden?

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here also.
Here also and there.

00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:16.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the stairs?

00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:18.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, from there and also . . .

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:20.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up here.

00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:23.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how many times
did the police come to the house?

00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:26.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, many, many times.

00:07:26.508 --> 00:07:28.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they hid them here?

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:30.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here? Yes.

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:31.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here.

00:07:33.807 --> 00:07:35.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
So under the eaves?

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:37.811 line:10% position:50% align:center
Yeah, in the roof.

00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:42.774 line:10% position:50% align:center
And then the books here—ten meters.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
They came how many times did you say?

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:08.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eighteen times—16, 17, 18.

00:08:08.884 --> 00:08:11.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they always searched in this area?

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:13.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did not find the books.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Nazis weren’t easily dissuaded.

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:21.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Golden Age” sign on the Kusserows’ house
was blacked out.

00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:24.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
But although the Witnesses
had been officially banned,

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:27.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
the family maintained
their religious activities in secret.

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:31.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said: “Magdalena, you go behind

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:34.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—three, four meters behind me.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
You carry the Bible,
and I’ll have nothing in my hands.”

00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:40.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she spoke with the people.

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:45.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was one man;
I don’t know who he was.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a stranger.

00:08:46.838 --> 00:08:51.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t belong to Bad Lippspringe,
and he denounced us.

00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:53.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
He called the police.

00:08:53.178 --> 00:08:57.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1936 was the first time

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:01.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mother was arrested in Paderborn.

00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:03.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the first time.

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:08.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Franz and Hilda Kusserow were
among the hundreds of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:09:08.527 --> 00:09:11.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
arrested by the Gestapo in 1936.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were briefly reunited in 1937

00:09:15.117 --> 00:09:18.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
when this last complete family photograph
was taken.

00:09:18.453 --> 00:09:19.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later that year,

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
their son Siegfried died
in a swimming accident.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
His death signaled the end of the idyll.

00:09:27.087 --> 00:09:29.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
By now, most Germans
were wallowing in nationalistic pride

00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:32.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and revived economic fortune.

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:34.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Communists, gypsies,

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:38.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
homosexuals, dissidents, the handicapped
and, above all, the Jews

00:09:38.098 --> 00:09:41.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
were hunted down even in Bad Lippspringe.

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:47.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, the town memorializes
its former Jewish residents.

00:09:47.774 --> 00:09:49.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little more than 50 years ago,

00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:52.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were hounding them out
and baying for their blood.

00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:56.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems a long while ago.

00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:58.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the moment, dissidents are tolerated.

00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:06.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses can sell their magazine,
<i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:10:06.418 --> 00:10:08.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and openly recruit converts.

00:10:11.298 --> 00:10:13.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1930’s,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
this street in Paderborn
was dominated by the prison.

00:10:16.094 --> 00:10:18.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is where the Kusserows were jailed.

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:22.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Witnesses began to lose
their jobs and pensions.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Gestapo stepped up their surveillance.

00:10:25.437 --> 00:10:29.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Kusserows’ garden
was still supplying fresh produce.

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:32.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
The three youngest members of the family
were being well cared for.

00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:34.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were the next target.

00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:44.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time,
I was ill and didn’t go to school.

00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:46.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was lying in bed here.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly, a car drove up.

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
There seemed to be two civilians in it.

00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:58.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could see them from the window.

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:05.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
They burst in and wanted me to go with them.

00:11:06.853 --> 00:11:10.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
They hesitated because I was ill,
so for appearances’ sake,

00:11:10.732 --> 00:11:13.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
they took me to a doctor
to see if I could be taken away.

00:11:19.824 --> 00:11:23.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they collected my sister and brother
from school,

00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:25.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we left.

00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:35.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were taken from school.

00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:38.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
My brother who was ill
was collected from home.

00:11:40.428 --> 00:11:44.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were taken by two policemen
to the orphanage in Dorsten.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can still remember how I vomited
all over the jacket of one of the policemen.

00:11:54.776 --> 00:11:58.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took a lot of effort to clean it up
once the car stopped.

00:12:01.324 --> 00:12:04.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the journey continued
to Dorsten and the orphanage.

00:12:12.627 --> 00:12:17.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the morning,
he again told us to give the Hitler salute.

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:20.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we refused,
he took us into a room,

00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:22.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
laid us across the table,

00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:24.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beat us black and blue.

00:12:26.683 --> 00:12:28.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was bad.

00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:34.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
We took a shower every evening,

00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:37.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when the female head of the house saw us,

00:12:37.694 --> 00:12:39.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
she made us bathe separately

00:12:39.696 --> 00:12:42.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the other children would not see.

00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:44.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very bad.

00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:47.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Second World War began,

00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:51.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two oldest Kusserow daughters,
Annemarie and Waltraud,

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:54.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
escaped surveillance
and left to find jobs in Berlin.

00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:57.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was more difficult for their brothers.

00:12:57.505 --> 00:13:02.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
In December 1939, Wilhelm,
after refusing military service,

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
was thrown into jail.

00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:07.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dear Parents, Brothers, and Sisters:

00:13:07.849 --> 00:13:10.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All of you know how much you mean to me,

00:13:10.477 --> 00:13:15.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I am repeatedly reminded of this
every time I look at our family photograph.

00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:17.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How harmonious things always were at home!

00:13:17.859 --> 00:13:20.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Nonetheless, above all else,

00:13:20.862 --> 00:13:24.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we must love God
—as our Führer, Jesus Christ, commanded.

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:28.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we stand up for Him, he will reward us.”

00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:31.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
As predominantly Aryan Germans,

00:13:31.998 --> 00:13:36.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses were sometimes allowed
the privilege of a Nazi trial.

00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:40.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, Wilhelm’s court-appointed lawyer,
Dr. James Roher, wrote to the family:

00:13:42.008 --> 00:13:45.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I had long conversations with your son
before his trial

00:13:45.428 --> 00:13:48.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and admired his calm confidence of faith.

00:13:48.098 --> 00:13:49.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He never wavered,

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“although he was severely pressed
from all quarters.

00:13:52.977 --> 00:13:56.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He calmly accepted the announcement
of the hour of his execution,

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:59.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
“refusing again to change his mind,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is,
to abandon his faith and save his life.

00:14:04.072 --> 00:14:08.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the morning of the execution,
I took his hand and said in consolation:

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Mr. Kusserow,
you have been wonderfully strong.

00:14:12.163 --> 00:14:14.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Remain strong now.’

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:17.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He squeezed my hand and smilingly replied:

00:14:17.502 --> 00:14:20.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No, Doctor, don’t be troubled.

00:14:20.088 --> 00:14:22.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am gaining everlasting life.

00:14:22.465 --> 00:14:25.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All this is only a change.’

00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:29.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He asked me to send you his greetings.

00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:33.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stood upright when facing death
and was dead at once.”

00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:39.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unable to browbeat the Witnesses,

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Nazis tried lies and subterfuge.

00:14:42.318 --> 00:14:46.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
With an elaborate ritual of deceit,
they issued certificates and reports

00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:50.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
declaring that Wilhelm Kusserow
had died a hero’s death,

00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:52.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
fighting for Hitler and the Third Reich.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some unknown reason,

00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:01.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Nazis allowed the family
to collect Wilhelm’s body

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:04.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Münster Prison,
where he’d been shot.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:07.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
His sister Waltraud helped
to arrange the funeral.

00:15:08.178 --> 00:15:10.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shocked me deep,

00:15:10.263 --> 00:15:14.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Wilhelm was true until his death.

00:15:14.934 --> 00:15:17.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have seen the body

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the little hall there,

00:15:21.232 --> 00:15:27.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was in a pilot suit.

00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:32.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here, like, here . . .

00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:33.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
The bullet holes?

00:15:34.204 --> 00:15:38.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, holes and some blood was in the mouth.

00:15:38.708 --> 00:15:43.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a big funeral
with the secret police around

00:15:43.338 --> 00:15:47.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with persons in uniform
—policemen.

00:15:48.343 --> 00:15:52.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my brother Karl

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:56.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
said some words.

00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:59.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later, my brother Karl

00:15:59.062 --> 00:16:03.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he spoke a few words and the prayer,

00:16:04.692 --> 00:16:07.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gestapo kept him.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Karl, son number three,
was the next arrested.

00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:16.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was brutally tortured in Dachau
and Sachsenhausen concentration camps.

00:16:17.664 --> 00:16:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
In April 1941, the Gestapo swooped again.

00:16:21.584 --> 00:16:25.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a brief release from jail,
Franz and Hilda Kusserow were rearrested,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
as were their daughters
Hildegard and Magdalena.

00:16:29.551 --> 00:16:31.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nazi tenants took over the house

00:16:31.636 --> 00:16:35.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
that once proclaimed
the dawning of a golden age.

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:37.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kusserows
were sent to concentration camps,

00:16:37.684 --> 00:16:41.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the Witnesses
were forced to wear distinctive insignia.

00:16:41.187 --> 00:16:43.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews wore a yellow star;

00:16:43.231 --> 00:16:45.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Witnesses, a purple triangle.

00:16:46.985 --> 00:16:51.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we went through the concentration camp,

00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:55.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw this purple triangle.

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:57.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I knew that there’s my sister.

00:16:57.954 --> 00:17:00.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said:
“Hello, Sister. How are you?

00:17:00.123 --> 00:17:02.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your name?
Where do you come from?”

00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:06.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Witnesses fared better in the camps
than many prisoners.

00:17:06.754 --> 00:17:09.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolute conviction in their faith
and strict discipline

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:11.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped their morale.

00:17:11.801 --> 00:17:14.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon Magdalena was joined at Ravensbrück

00:17:14.304 --> 00:17:16.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
by her mother and her sister Hildegard.

00:17:16.681 --> 00:17:18.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw my mother.

00:17:18.016 --> 00:17:22.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy, and she told me everything.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was happy.

00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:26.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was really good
because I had swollen arms.

00:17:26.399 --> 00:17:27.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t walk.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t dress myself
because of this sickness or something.

00:17:33.197 --> 00:17:38.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my mother dressed me;
she fixed my hair.

00:17:39.162 --> 00:17:41.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the evil and hardship at Ravensbrück,

00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:44.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frau Kusserow kept her faith.

00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:47.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her son Wilhelm
had given his life for the faith,

00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:50.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his younger brother Wolfgang,
when called for military service,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed true Kusserow defiance.

00:17:53.801 --> 00:17:56.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was brought up
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:17:56.346 --> 00:18:00.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to God’s word
contained in the Holy Scriptures.

00:18:00.224 --> 00:18:03.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest and most holy law
he gave mankind is:

00:18:03.978 --> 00:18:06.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You shall love your God above all else

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:09.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your neighbor as yourself.”

00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:13.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other commandments read:
“You must not kill.”

00:18:13.446 --> 00:18:17.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did our Creator
have all this written down for the trees?

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Jesus Christ and his disciples
were persecuted,

00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:28.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
so are God’s people also persecuted today.

00:18:28.211 --> 00:18:32.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know for sure that if Jesus Christ
were to live on earth today,

00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:35.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would be persecuted just as he was then.

00:18:39.222 --> 00:18:43.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wolfgang was beheaded on March 28, 1942.

00:18:43.434 --> 00:18:46.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
The night before, he wrote:

00:18:46.437 --> 00:18:49.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My Dear Parents
and My Dear Brothers and Sisters:

00:18:49.565 --> 00:18:51.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I shall leave you
as your third son and brother

00:18:51.943 --> 00:18:53.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“early in the morning.

00:18:53.277 --> 00:18:54.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be not sad.

00:18:54.278 --> 00:18:57.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The time will come
when we shall be together again.

00:18:57.532 --> 00:19:00.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those who sow with tears will reap with joy.

00:19:03.246 --> 00:19:06.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At James 1:12, it says:

00:19:06.332 --> 00:19:08.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Blessed is the man
that endureth temptation:

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for when he is tried,
he shall receive the crown of life,

00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:15.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which [Jehovah] hath promised
to them that love him.’

00:19:15.925 --> 00:19:18.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In this faith and in this conviction,

00:19:18.011 --> 00:19:19.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I go from you.

00:19:19.804 --> 00:19:22.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your son and brother, Wolfgang.”

00:19:26.894 --> 00:19:29.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
By now, Waltraud had returned from Berlin

00:19:29.897 --> 00:19:33.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and managed to find work
in this florist shop in Paderborn.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:39.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was ordered to greet customers
with the “Heil Hitler” salutation.

00:19:40.074 --> 00:19:41.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
She refused.

00:19:48.624 --> 00:19:51.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
After being given eight days
to change her mind,

00:19:51.544 --> 00:19:53.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
she still refused and was arrested

00:19:53.838 --> 00:19:57.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
and imprisoned in Paderborn
and told to make ammunition.

00:19:58.384 --> 00:20:01.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cannot work for the war.

00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:04.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this, I cannot work; this is for the war.

00:20:04.307 --> 00:20:06.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
My brother was killed, was shot.

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
My other brother was beheaded.

00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:11.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
My three sisters, little ones,

00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:15.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gestapo have kept.

00:20:15.276 --> 00:20:18.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my other brother
is in a concentration camp;

00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:20.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mother is in a concentration camp;

00:20:20.323 --> 00:20:23.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
my two sisters and also my father
are in prison.

00:20:23.576 --> 00:20:25.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I cannot make them.

00:20:27.497 --> 00:20:32.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1944, just one member
of the Kusserow family was free,

00:20:32.168 --> 00:20:35.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Annemarie, who was still in Berlin.

00:20:35.129 --> 00:20:37.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every week,

00:20:37.131 --> 00:20:41.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had with me in my apartment

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
some persons

00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:45.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a Bible study.

00:20:46.808 --> 00:20:51.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
And therefore, I was arrested.

00:20:51.813 --> 00:20:56.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
There must have been a person
who had observed us.

00:20:59.237 --> 00:21:02.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Nazis had rounded up
every single member of the family.

00:21:02.907 --> 00:21:07.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were dead
and the future for the rest uncertain.

00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, they had a lifeline.

00:21:08.746 --> 00:21:10.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike all other prisoners,

00:21:10.456 --> 00:21:13.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
could secure their release

00:21:13.209 --> 00:21:17.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
simply by signing a declaration
that they’d abandon their faith.

00:21:17.421 --> 00:21:21.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of the thousands arrested,
only a handful did so.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was not ready to sign.

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:28.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought:

00:21:28.307 --> 00:21:32.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh, I have to think of my parents,

00:21:32.186 --> 00:21:35.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘my little children

00:21:35.439 --> 00:21:39.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘—I mean my brothers and my sisters.

00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:43.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They are so faithful, so obedient,

00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:46.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘although we were all separated.

00:21:46.617 --> 00:21:48.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We were all separated.

00:21:48.661 --> 00:21:52.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And when I am now free,

00:21:52.582 --> 00:21:54.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘what should I do?

00:21:56.544 --> 00:22:00.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My conscience
—I have thought it over.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is impossible to be unfaithful.’

00:22:03.634 --> 00:22:08.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could I sign that I am not a Witness?

00:22:08.598 --> 00:22:10.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could I leave my faith?

00:22:10.975 --> 00:22:14.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never, never, never!

00:22:15.062 --> 00:22:19.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
In April 1945,
Ravensbrück concentration camp was liberated.

00:22:20.318 --> 00:22:23.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hilda Kusserow and her daughters
were released.

00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:25.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imprisonment
had strengthened their faith,

00:22:25.823 --> 00:22:29.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
and morally the Witnesses
had defeated the Nazis.

00:22:29.452 --> 00:22:31.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hilda was reunited with her husband

00:22:31.913 --> 00:22:35.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, with the surviving members
of their family, rebuilt their lives.

00:22:37.668 --> 00:22:39.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although they never returned
to their “Golden Age” home,

00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:43.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
they always remained
faithful Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:47.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were back in a Germany
where the Protestant and Catholic churches

00:22:47.511 --> 00:22:50.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
were still the predominant religious groups.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite rebellion and martyrdom
by some believers,

00:22:53.726 --> 00:22:56.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
most church leaders
had bowed the knee to the Nazis.

00:22:56.771 --> 00:23:01.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hitler, confirmed a Catholic,
was never excommunicated.

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:05.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
The church was silent
while millions of Jews and others died.

00:23:06.697 --> 00:23:09.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among the organized Christian religions
in Germany,

00:23:09.116 --> 00:23:11.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was only the Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:23:11.118 --> 00:23:15.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
who refused any compromise at all
with Hitler and the Nazis.

00:23:15.081 --> 00:23:18.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the first Christians,
they too were reviled and ridiculed

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:20.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were martyred.

00:23:20.461 --> 00:23:23.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among the millions who perished
in the Holocaust,

00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:25.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were some 5,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:30.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet those who survived proclaimed
that there is a purpose to all this.

00:23:30.846 --> 00:23:33.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a God.
