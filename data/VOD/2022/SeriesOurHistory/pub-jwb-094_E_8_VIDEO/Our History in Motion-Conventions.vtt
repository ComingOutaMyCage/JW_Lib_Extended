00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:04.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good morning, brothers and sisters!

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:07.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
How delightful it is to be gathered together

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this spiritual occasion!

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
love gathering at conventions

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn, worship, and sing together.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
But large conventions like these,

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
with tens of thousands meeting together,

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
weren’t always a part
of our modern-day worship.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they get started?

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out in this episode

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:45.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
The very first large assembly
of Jehovah’s people

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
was actually held thousands of years ago

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Israelites gathered
with Moses at Mount Sinai

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
for spiritual instruction.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, the Israelites
attended three festivals each year.

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:01.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just like today’s conventions,

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
those gatherings brought people together
from different tribes

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:07.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
to praise Him as one big family.

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:09.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
In modern times,

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:13.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
our first conventions
were held in the late 1880’s.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they weren’t exactly
what we’d think of as conventions today.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
With just a few hundred in attendance,

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were really just big meetings
that brought the Bible Students together

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:26.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
to commemorate the Lord’s Evening Meal.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were all held
in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:36.033 line:10% position:50% align:center
But that changed in 1893

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:39.119 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the opening of the Chicago World’s Fair.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fair drew millions of people.

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the railroads offering
discounted rates to Chicago,

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students saw it
as a perfect opportunity

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:52.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
to invite the brothers and sisters
for a five-day convention.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:56.303 line:10% position:50% align:center
About 360 attended

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:59.932 line:10% position:50% align:center
—a small crowd by today’s standards.

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
But early conventions like this one

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped the Bible Students see
just how upbuilding it was

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet with fellow believers
from other areas.

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:14.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually,
conventions became an annual event.

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were held outdoors or in a tent,

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the 1908 convention at Put-in-Bay,

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
a summer resort on Lake Erie, Ohio.

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:27.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
This convention was ten days long!

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was the largest up to that time,

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an estimated 3,500 or more
in attendance.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a chance for brothers and sisters,
young and old,

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:41.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be spiritually refreshed,
spend time together,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
laugh together, eat together,

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:48.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build true bonds of friendship and love.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world then suffered
the devastating effects of World War I

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:57.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had taken an estimated 50 million lives.

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:04.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that did not stop God’s people.

00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:07.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our bonds of love became even more evident

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:10.169 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1919 at Cedar Point, Ohio.

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the first major convention held

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Brother Rutherford and his associates

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
had been released from prison.

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:21.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thrilled to finally gather together safely,

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students
just kept coming and coming

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:27.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the entire program
had to be moved outdoors,

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:30.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
with some 7,000 in attendance.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just three years later, in 1922,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cedar Point was the location
of an even more exciting convention,

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an average daily attendance
of about 10,000.

00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
It energized God’s people
to go on preaching with renewed vigor.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many conventions in the years that followed

00:03:56.173 --> 00:04:00.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped unite God’s people
in even more powerful ways,

00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the unforgettable one
held in Columbus, Ohio, in 1931.

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:10.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine stepping into the Coliseum
at the Fair Grounds,

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:13.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are 15,000 in attendance,

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:16.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the place is packed.

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your program has two large letters
printed on the front:

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW.

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the first two days of the convention,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone is trying to guess
what those letters mean.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just Watch?

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:31.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just Wait?

00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:35.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, Brother Rutherford steps on stage.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Near the end of his talk,
he presents a resolution

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:41.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
that climaxes with the words:

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:46.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We desire to be known as
and called by the name, to wit, 

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:49.726 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>Jehovah’s witnesses.</i>”

00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:56.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1940’s,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
World War II had left many countries
devastated and divided,

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:06.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah’s Witnesses
were growing in number and in unity.

00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:08.620 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 1946,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.747 line:10% position:50% align:center
they gathered in Cleveland, Ohio,

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:13.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly,

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.085 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the name

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:17.087 line:10% position:50% align:center
couldn’t have been more appropriate.

00:05:17.963 --> 00:05:21.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a true international convention

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:24.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 55,000 delegates

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:26.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 33 different nations.

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:30.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some even camped
in tents and trailers to be there.

00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:32.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tent cities were a common sight

00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:35.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
during big conventions of this era.

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:40.152 line:10% position:50% align:center
With our spiritual family continuing to grow,

00:05:40.152 --> 00:05:42.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
conventions during the 1950’s

00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:44.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
were held around the world

00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:48.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in places where resources were limited.

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:51.121 line:10% position:50% align:center
A landmark example

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:52.998 line:10% position:50% align:center
of just how international

00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:54.750 line:10% position:50% align:center
 conventions had become

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.460 line:10% position:50% align:center
was the incredible

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.963 line:10% position:50% align:center
1958 Divine Will International Assembly

00:05:59.963 --> 00:06:01.423 line:10% position:50% align:center
in New York City,

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:02.758 line:10% position:50% align:center
which was attended

00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:06.011 line:10% position:50% align:center
by more than a quarter of a million people

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:08.013 line:10% position:50% align:center
from 123 lands.

00:06:08.972 --> 00:06:12.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the largest international convention

00:06:12.142 --> 00:06:14.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
ever held in one city,

00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:15.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
filling Yankee Stadium

00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:19.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, just four blocks away, the Polo Grounds.

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:21.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest assembly
of true Christians ever held

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:23.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
is opening this day.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are certain that Jehovah is with us

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we are here by divine will.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:35.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what unified God’s people
at conventions like this one

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
wasn’t simply gathering together
in large numbers.

00:06:38.418 --> 00:06:41.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the spiritual content:

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:43.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
riveting talks,

00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:46.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
practical symposiums, new releases

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:48.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, starting in the 1960’s,

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:52.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible dramas on stage in full costume.

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:55.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those spiritual gifts

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:59.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the joy of meeting new friends
and uniting with old ones

00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:02.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
have made assembling together
a true blessing.

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:06.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it hasn’t always been easy.

00:07:06.738 --> 00:07:08.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the country of Georgia,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Witnesses had faced severe opposition,

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:13.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
plans were set to hold

00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:18.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
the 2006 “Deliverance at Hand!”
District Convention

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Tbilisi Philharmonic concert hall.

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the hall management canceled the contract

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
just one week before the convention!

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:30.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
With just days before the opening session,

00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:33.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
an army of determined brothers and sisters

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:37.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
turned two plots of farmland
into a convention site

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:40.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
—harvesting the potatoes
planted on the property,

00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:44.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
building a stage and benches for seating,

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:46.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and installing sound equipment.

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:51.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it was time for the first session,
everything was ready

00:07:51.783 --> 00:07:54.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more than 17,000 attended

00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:57.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
either on site or by telephone tie-in.

00:07:58.332 --> 00:08:01.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only did the convention
come off without a hitch

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the attendees were overwhelmed
with another unexpected blessing

00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:09.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the <i>New World Translation</i>  in Georgian—

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:11.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
unifying them even further

00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:14.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their brothers and sisters
around the world.

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:17.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
In modern times like these,

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:19.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
special and international conventions

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:23.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been held in far-flung places
around the world.
