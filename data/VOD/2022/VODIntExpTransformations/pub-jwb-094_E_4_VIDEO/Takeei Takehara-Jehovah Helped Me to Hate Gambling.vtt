Dad left us when I was around five years old.

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:13.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when I was 15,
we found out Mum had cancer,

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:18.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she passed away six months later.

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:20.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was only 39.

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:25.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
My two younger brothers
were still in elementary school,

00:00:25.174 --> 00:00:27.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I woke up early,

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:31.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
did the milk rounds,
worked in a factory during the day,

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:33.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and went to school at night.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life was super busy then.

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life became significantly easier
after marriage.

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:47.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since my wife did the housework,
all I needed to do was work.

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:51.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I was so busy

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:54.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I never really got to have any fun.

00:00:56.961 --> 00:01:00.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, a friend took me to a betting shop

00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:02.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
for horse racing,

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:09.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to my surprise, I got lucky.

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:14.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was surprised that you can buy a ticket

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then you get all this money
in your hands.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s how it started.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gradually became worse, to the point

00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:29.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I would get off of the night shift

00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:32.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and go straight to the races.

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:36.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved gambling more
than eating and sleeping.

00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:43.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
On my way home,
images of my wife and children

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
would come to my mind,

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:48.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I had this nagging feeling

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:50.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I really should
be getting my life together.

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:55.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was broke,
I would go to the pawn shops.

00:01:56.946 --> 00:02:00.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
I pawned our camera
and even my wife’s jewelry.

00:02:02.703 --> 00:02:05.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife started studying the Bible,

00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:09.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to try and make my wife and children
a little happy,

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:11.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also agreed to a study.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I started gambling,
I liked growing vegetables.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.142 line:10% position:50% align:center
You know, everything a vegetable needs,

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.769 line:10% position:50% align:center
all the instructions to grow,

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in this tiny seed

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:29.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is one or two millimeters in size.

00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:32.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that couldn’t just happen by chance.

00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:36.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was convinced

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there must be a God.

00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:42.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through my Bible study,

00:02:42.248 --> 00:02:44.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned that this God is Jehovah,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that made me really happy.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I found you!’
That’s how I felt.

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, it was really difficult
to quit gambling.

00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:58.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, many times I wanted to quit,

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:00.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would pay back my loans

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:02.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then take out some more again.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife’s relative said to me,

00:03:06.443 --> 00:03:08.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Only death can cure you.”

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I had this conviction
that the Creator exists,

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:19.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet on the other hand,
I was deep into gambling.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew Jehovah saw it all,
and I hated myself.

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:28.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
I attended a circuit assembly
for the first time.

00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:37.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Put away the old personality,
and put on the new personality.’

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:40.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was reading those words from the Bible,

00:03:40.607 --> 00:03:43.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that was about me.

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:48.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I asked myself, ‘Hey, what’s happening
to my life right now?,’

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how horrible and ugly

00:03:52.037 --> 00:03:54.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mindset was.

00:03:54.957 --> 00:03:57.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt tears well up.

00:03:58.044 --> 00:04:00.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew this was Jehovah talking to me,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I felt determined
to do something about it.

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t do it on my own,

00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:14.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I prayed to Jehovah
from the bottom of my heart, saying:

00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:19.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I really want to stop, no matter what.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I want to hate gambling
and not just avoid it.

00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:27.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please give me this feeling of hate.”

00:04:27.744 --> 00:04:29.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed like this every day.

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:35.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since then,

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:39.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have felt zero desire to gamble.

00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:45.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was one time during work
when I passed by a racetrack.

00:04:46.558 --> 00:04:49.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved bicycle racing before,

00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:52.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now I felt this deep revulsion.

00:04:55.568 --> 00:04:57.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:03.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
my prayers were answered.

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:07.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt Jehovah’s patience

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:10.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so much appreciation

00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:12.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
for

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:18.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he allowed me in,

00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:20.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing who I was.

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I had continued that path,

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:34.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure my family would have broken apart.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
My relatives are all surprised at me.

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:42.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure those trying to stop gambling
have many concerns,

00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:47.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as long as you have that desire
to pour out those feelings to Jehovah

00:05:47.628 --> 00:05:49.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
and jump into his arms,

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:51.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll take you in.

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:54.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
He won’t leave you.

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really want them to know Jehovah

00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:58.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
as that kind of Person.
