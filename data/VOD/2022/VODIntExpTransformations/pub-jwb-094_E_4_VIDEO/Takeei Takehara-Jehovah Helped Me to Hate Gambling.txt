00:00:03 Dad left us when I was around five years old.
00:00:09 Then when I was 15, we found out Mum had cancer,
00:00:15 and she passed away six months later.
00:00:18 She was only 39.
00:00:21 My two younger brothers were still in elementary school,
00:00:25 so I woke up early,
00:00:27 did the milk rounds, worked in a factory during the day,
00:00:31 and went to school at night.
00:00:34 My life was super busy then.
00:00:38 My life became significantly easier after marriage.
00:00:43 Since my wife did the housework, all I needed to do was work.
00:00:49 Before I was so busy
00:00:51 that I never really got to have any fun.
00:00:56 One day, a friend took me to a betting shop
00:01:00 for horse racing,
00:01:06 and to my surprise, I got lucky.
00:01:10 I was surprised that you can buy a ticket
00:01:14 and then you get all this money in your hands.
00:01:18 So that’s how it started.
00:01:24 It gradually became worse, to the point
00:01:27 that I would get off of the night shift
00:01:29 and go straight to the races.
00:01:32 I loved gambling more than eating and sleeping.
00:01:40 On my way home, images of my wife and children
00:01:43 would come to my mind,
00:01:45 and I had this nagging feeling
00:01:48 that I really should be getting my life together.
00:01:51 When I was broke, I would go to the pawn shops.
00:01:56 I pawned our camera and even my wife’s jewelry.
00:02:02 My wife started studying the Bible,
00:02:05 and to try and make my wife and children a little happy,
00:02:09 I also agreed to a study.
00:02:13 Before I started gambling, I liked growing vegetables.
00:02:19 You know, everything a vegetable needs,
00:02:22 all the instructions to grow,
00:02:23 is in this tiny seed
00:02:26 that is one or two millimeters in size.
00:02:29 I knew that couldn’t just happen by chance.
00:02:34 I was convinced
00:02:36 that there must be a God.
00:02:39 Through my Bible study,
00:02:42 I learned that this God is Jehovah,
00:02:44 and that made me really happy.
00:02:47 ‘I found you!’ That’s how I felt.
00:02:50 However, it was really difficult to quit gambling.
00:02:54 You know, many times I wanted to quit,
00:02:58 and I would pay back my loans
00:03:00 but then take out some more again.
00:03:03 My wife’s relative said to me,
00:03:06 “Only death can cure you.”
00:03:11 So I had this conviction that the Creator exists,
00:03:14 yet on the other hand, I was deep into gambling.
00:03:19 I knew Jehovah saw it all, and I hated myself.
00:03:25 I attended a circuit assembly for the first time.
00:03:32 ‘Put away the old personality, and put on the new personality.’
00:03:37 As I was reading those words from the Bible,
00:03:40 I felt that was about me.
00:03:43 When I asked myself, ‘Hey, what’s happening to my life right now?,’
00:03:48 I saw how horrible and ugly
00:03:52 my mindset was.
00:03:54 I felt tears well up.
00:03:58 I knew this was Jehovah talking to me,
00:04:00 and I felt determined to do something about it.
00:04:07 I couldn’t do it on my own,
00:04:10 so I prayed to Jehovah from the bottom of my heart, saying:
00:04:15 “I really want to stop, no matter what.
00:04:20 “I want to hate gambling and not just avoid it.
00:04:24 Please give me this feeling of hate.”
00:04:27 I prayed like this every day.
00:04:33 Since then,
00:04:36 I have felt zero desire to gamble.
00:04:41 There was one time during work when I passed by a racetrack.
00:04:46 I loved bicycle racing before,
00:04:49 but now I felt this deep revulsion.
00:04:55 I knew
00:05:01 my prayers were answered.
00:05:05 I felt Jehovah’s patience
00:05:07 and so much appreciation
00:05:11 for
00:05:15 how he allowed me in,
00:05:18 knowing who I was.
00:05:28 If I had continued that path,
00:05:30 I’m sure my family would have broken apart.
00:05:34 My relatives are all surprised at me.
00:05:38 I’m sure those trying to stop gambling have many concerns,
00:05:42 but as long as you have that desire to pour out those feelings to Jehovah
00:05:47 and jump into his arms,
00:05:49 he’ll take you in.
00:05:51 He won’t leave you.
00:05:54 I really want them to know Jehovah
00:05:56 as that kind of Person.
