00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:03.687 line:10% position:50% align:center
For over 100 years,

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:05.055 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:06.489 line:10% position:50% align:center
has been producing books

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:08.758 line:10% position:50% align:center
to help us teach people Bible truths.

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:12.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
when some of these study books were released? 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.532 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>“This Means Everlasting Life” </i>

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:18.068 line:10% position:50% align:center
was released in 1950;

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:20.270 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</i>

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.272 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1968;

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.708 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,</i>

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.576 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1982;

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:29.579 line:10% position:50% align:center
and <i>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life,</i>

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.581 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1995.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did those titles have in common?

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:38.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed that it’s possible
for a person to learn

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:41.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah requires to live forever.

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why
we keep searching for people

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:45.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are “rightly disposed
for everlasting life”

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who are willing
to study the Bible with us.

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:52.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of those books and several more
that we published since then

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:55.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been instrumental in helping people

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
become believers
in our wonderful hope for the future.

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2021,
we added one more book to the list, entitled 

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:06.182 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:08.485 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course.</i>

00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:11.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
This title adds another element:

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:14.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s possible
not only to gain everlasting life

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:18.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to learn how to enjoy life even now.

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:23.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title is taken from Psalm 22:26,
which says:

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those seeking Jehovah will praise him.

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:30.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you enjoy life forever.”

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
This newest study publication
is very different

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all the others that we’ve produced.

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:38.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this broadcast,
we want to explain

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
what went on behind the scenes

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
to produce <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the direction of the Governing Body,

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
hundreds of Bethelites around the world

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked very hard to make it possible

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:52.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to have this innovative study tool.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, they’ll be quick to say
that all credit for this goes to Jehovah.

00:01:58.234 --> 00:01:59.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we can say

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:04.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as the prophet Isaiah said
in ancient times of our great God:

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:07.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, . . .

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything we have done
you have accomplished for us.”

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:13.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that any success we enjoy

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because of Jehovah’s direction
and blessing.

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:19.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the theme of this presentation is

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:23.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“See What Jehovah Has Done for Us!”

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:27.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The faithful and discreet slave”
has always taken very seriously

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:31.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ command
recorded at Matthew 28:19:

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:36.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go, . . . and make disciples of people
of all the nations, baptizing them.”

00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:40.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what our Bible study activity
aims to accomplish.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
For decades,
our method of conducting studies

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:47.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
was to study printed material
paragraph by paragraph.

00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:50.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
When answering
the questions for the paragraphs,

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:54.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
some students would often just repeat
what was stated in the book.

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:56.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
it was hard to know whether the truth

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
was really touching their heart.

00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:02.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
With <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
we’re using a different method of teaching

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
that generates candid expressions
by the students in their own words.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is just what the Governing Body
feels is needed

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring new ones to dedication and baptism

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:15.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
during these urgent last days.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve begun conducting Bible studies
with <i>Enjoy Life Forever!,</i>

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can appreciate
how it’s adjusting our Bible study work.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what some longtime pioneers have said

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
after covering just one lesson
on their studies:

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This was
the most beautiful spiritual conversation

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have ever had with a student!”

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:40.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My student revealed things
she had never told me before.

00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:43.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt as if I was hearing her heart
for the first time!”

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:49.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It truly reaches the heart
and motivates students to action.”

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:54.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one brother wrote:
“I am so excited about this new Bible course

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:57.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I am begging Jehovah to hear my prayers

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to conduct progressive studies.”

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:04.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was early in 2019
when the Writing Committee

00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:08.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
took on the amazing project to produce
a new Bible study tool.

00:04:08.798 --> 00:04:12.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
They assembled a team of writers,
designers, and consultants

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
to investigate whether we could improve
the publications that we were then using.

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:20.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the very first discussion session,

00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:24.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone was encouraged
to pray often about the task at hand

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:28.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to pray when thinking about it,
when brainstorming with others,

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when working on it—

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:32.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to respond
to the influence of holy spirit.

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:36.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why pray so much?

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:40.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 16:3 gives the answer:

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:44.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Commit to Jehovah whatever you do,

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:46.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your plans will succeed.”

00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:51.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
The team was also encouraged
to think outside the box,

00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:53.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means to think outside, or beyond,

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:56.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way things
have always been done in the past.

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:59.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Times have changed,
people have changed,

00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:03.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the way that many prefer to be taught
has changed.

00:05:03.186 --> 00:05:05.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
These days they respond better to multimedia

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:08.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
that engages them
and holds their attention.

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
The team was shown a puzzle

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
that illustrates what it means
to think outside the box

00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:17.200 line:10% position:50% align:center
—the nine-dots puzzle.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.969 line:10% position:50% align:center
The challenge is to connect all nine dots

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.038 line:10% position:50% align:center
with just four straight lines.

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:23.706 line:10% position:50% align:center
Here are a few examples

00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:25.742 line:10% position:50% align:center
of how some will try to solve the puzzle.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.744 line:10% position:50% align:center
Notice that with each attempt

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.512 line:10% position:50% align:center
one dot is missed.

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:31.347 line:10% position:50% align:center
The problem is that our mind tends

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.416 line:10% position:50% align:center
to build a box around the dots,

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.917 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that instantly limits

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.619 line:10% position:50% align:center
what we can imagine.

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:39.422 line:10% position:50% align:center
The only way to connect all nine dots

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.424 line:10% position:50% align:center
with just four straight lines

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.693 line:10% position:50% align:center
is by going outside the box

00:05:43.693 --> 00:05:45.328 line:10% position:50% align:center
and thinking differently

00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:47.363 line:10% position:50% align:center
than we normally would.

00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:52.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point was to show
that novel, creative thinking

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
was needed to imagine something

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:57.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
other than the traditional way
of studying the Bible with people.

00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:00.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s spirit guiding fresh thinking,

00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:03.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would be interesting to see
what innovative ideas could be thought of

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
for how to teach the truth to Bible students.

00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:09.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet,
it was felt that our brothers and sisters

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
would need to see some familiar features
in the new publication.

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:15.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why the first part of each lesson

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:17.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed
similar to the <i>Good News</i>  brochure.

00:06:18.661 --> 00:06:20.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
It features numbered questions,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
each followed by a paragraph

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:24.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
that briefly covers fundamental facts

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the topic.

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:28.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, the “Dig Deeper” section

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
reasons on the topic,

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:31.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows how to apply what’s learned,

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:34.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and discusses what the topic teaches us

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:36.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah.

00:06:36.012 --> 00:06:37.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes features found

00:06:37.547 --> 00:06:39.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the <i>Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook </i>

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
—bulleted discussion points,

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:42.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
scriptures to read,

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:44.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
videos to play,

00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:46.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
and viewpoint questions to answer.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:49.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like the study articles
in <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:53.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
the last part of each lesson
includes just three review questions.

00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:57.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was decided that we could cover
much less printed material

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let the Bible do the teaching

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we need
to draw out the student’s feelings

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:05.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
with well-worded viewpoint questions

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and include videos and generous artwork.

00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:10.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must help the student

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see Jehovah as a real Person

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:16.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to develop
a warm relationship with him

00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:18.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encourage the student
to get into a routine

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:21.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
of regular Bible reading, prayer,
and meeting attendance.

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:27.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  provide
what we need to accomplish all of that?

00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:29.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly does!

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:33.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scriptures
are the focal point of each lesson,

00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:37.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the student is prompted
to find answers in the Bible.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
The questions draw out the student’s feelings
about what he’s learning.

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:43.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in the course,
students are helped

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:46.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
to appreciate what Jehovah is like,

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:48.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel his love for them,

00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:52.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see how to draw close to him
as their Friend.

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:57.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
The beautiful artwork and motivating videos
have real emotional impact.

00:07:58.794 --> 00:08:01.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
This project to produce <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:05.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
required the collaboration
of six departments at world headquarters.

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:08.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
As directed by the Governing Body,

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Writing Department researched, wrote,

00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:14.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and proofread the text for each lesson.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
These were then sent to hundreds
of brothers and sisters around the world

00:08:17.647 --> 00:08:19.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
to test them on their Bible studies.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Writing Department coordinated the work
with other departments

00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:26.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep the project on schedule.

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:29.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Translation Services helped to simplify

00:08:29.992 --> 00:08:32.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
the vocabulary and logic of what was written.

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:35.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
They identified any English text

00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:39.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be a problem for translators
to render in their local languages.

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
As of right now,
<i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:46.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been approved
in upward of 700 languages.

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:48.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Art Department designed

00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:51.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
the book’s layout and artwork.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teams in several branches photographed models

00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:54.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help the illustrators

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
create the many beautiful scenes

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
that appear in the book,

00:08:58.354 --> 00:09:01.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
which contains over 600 images.

00:09:01.757 --> 00:09:03.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
MEPS Programming developed new tools

00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:07.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the digital version of the book
in the <i>JW Library®</i> app

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
would look similar to the printed edition.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the first publication

00:09:12.602 --> 00:09:15.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
for which both print and digital formats

00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:17.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
were designed simultaneously.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Text Processing Services
composed the text and artwork

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
for both the print and digital formats,

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
transcribed the book into English braille,

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:27.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and instructed the branches

00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:28.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how to produce the book

00:09:28.884 --> 00:09:30.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their languages.

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:34.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Audio/Video Services
produced several new videos and excerpts

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
of many existing videos
from the jw.org website.

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:42.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also produced
unique audio recordings of the book

00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:45.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
that include various voices and sounds.

00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:48.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was truly a collaborative effort!

00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:50.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there was a major problem

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could have stalled this project:

00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:54.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
COVID-19.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:58.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
When world headquarters and the branches
were locked down,

00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:02.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
60 percent of the project
still needed to be completed.

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:05.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, the Governing Body
had given it high priority.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video will give you some idea

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:12.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how the departments 
worked together to get their work done

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:16.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the challenges
they faced during the pandemic.

00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:19.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything about <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:10:19.001 --> 00:10:21.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
is different from any other publication

00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:22.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve produced in the past.

00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:23.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from the start of the project,

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:24.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
two things were critical:

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
good communication and good documentation.

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
But honestly, time and again,

00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
the thing that proved
to be the most important

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
was reliance on Jehovah.

00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:34.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Writing Committee’s goal was to create

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:36.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
a first-class digital experience

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:38.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would engage Bible students.

00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:42.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
The digital design system
had to be completely remodeled

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i> would look uniform

00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:47.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s viewed in <i>JW Library®,</i>

00:10:47.163 --> 00:10:49.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org, or in print.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:52.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right from the inception of this project,

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:53.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers looked for input

00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:55.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the study material would be

00:10:55.104 --> 00:10:58.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
easily available
in as many languages as possible.

00:10:58.007 --> 00:11:01.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for that reason,
a team from Translation Services

00:11:01.377 --> 00:11:03.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked along with the writers.

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
A publication of this size would usually take

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
about two or three years to complete,

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the Writing Committee

00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:11.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
was really interested
in getting the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book

00:11:11.787 --> 00:11:13.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
out there as soon as possible.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.191 line:10% position:50% align:center
The <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book

00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:17.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
required an intense amount of collaboration.

00:11:17.193 --> 00:11:18.260 line:10% position:50% align:center
Right from the beginning,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.261 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Writing Committee

00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:20.896 line:10% position:50% align:center
got all six departments together

00:11:20.896 --> 00:11:23.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we could work unitedly
through the production.

00:11:56.932 --> 00:11:59.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our existing tool set didn’t have the ability

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:02.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
to style digital publications
like we can with print.

00:12:02.772 --> 00:12:07.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could do black text
on a white background with gray boxes.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the extent of the functionality
that we had available.

00:12:11.046 --> 00:12:14.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i> 
is very interactive for the student.

00:12:14.016 --> 00:12:16.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
When producing the audio
for this publication,

00:12:16.218 --> 00:12:18.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
we endeavored to maintain that feel.

00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:22.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we added multiple voices, musical cues

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in some cases,
the audio track for the video

00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:28.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
was reedited to teach the point effectively.

00:12:28.063 --> 00:12:30.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got to Lesson 32,

00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:32.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
we felt that it might be too complicated

00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:34.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build as a digital experience,

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:37.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that’s when
the collaboration really paid off.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took every tool that we had

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and basically every trick in order to build

00:12:41.811 --> 00:12:44.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
the digital version of that lesson.

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:46.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we were working on the prototype,

00:12:46.148 --> 00:12:48.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would collaborate
with the User Experience Group

00:12:48.284 --> 00:12:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that the look and feel
of the digital edition

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the same whether it was on a large device

00:12:53.122 --> 00:12:55.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a small device.

00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:57.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
The entire chart is a visual aid.

00:12:57.326 --> 00:12:59.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wanted to be sure
that all of our users,

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:01.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially those who are visually impaired,

00:13:01.464 --> 00:13:03.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be able to understand
the teaching point.

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:06.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
This required us to build the chart

00:13:06.302 --> 00:13:08.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that screen readers could read the text

00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:11.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that each picture would have
a description for those who needed it.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:16.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in the concept stage,
we understood that there would be

00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:18.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 200 videos in this publication,

00:13:18.013 --> 00:13:20.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
requiring thousands of hours of work:

00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:22.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
eight brand new videos

00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:25.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of the remaining videos,
around 60 would need to be edited.

00:13:25.588 --> 00:13:29.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as eight new videos
were entering their production phase,

00:13:29.024 --> 00:13:31.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
COVID-19 hit,
effectively halting

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
video production around the world.

00:13:33.462 --> 00:13:36.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
This work stoppage continued
until each branch could determine

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:39.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they could film safely

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:42.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still meet the deadline
only nine months away.

00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:45.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the pandemic,
photo sessions here at headquarters

00:13:45.007 --> 00:13:47.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
were completely stopped for four months.

00:13:47.376 --> 00:13:50.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as things progressed,
we were able to resume photography,

00:13:50.713 --> 00:13:53.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
only by adhering to strict protocols.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:56.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we had a family photograph themselves

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
while being directed
by the Art Department here.

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
So everything that a Bible study conductor
had been trained to do

00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:04.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
—ask all the important questions,

00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:07.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
develop love for Jehovah
in their Bible students, show videos—

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:09.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s all built into the publication.

00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:12.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
So would the concept work
with actual Bible students?

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:15.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find out, we did in-house testing.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then at the same time,

00:14:16.572 --> 00:14:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
we sent out the lessons
around the world to publishers, pioneers,

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:21.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
missionaries, and circuit overseers.

00:14:21.877 --> 00:14:24.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they used the lessons
with actual Bible students.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tested every lesson of the book this way.

00:14:27.249 --> 00:14:29.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the responses
that we got back were analyzed,

00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:31.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we made further refinements.

00:14:31.587 --> 00:14:35.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had hundreds of team meetings,
and we felt Jehovah’s holy spirit

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
equipping all of us
after we opened a meeting with prayer.

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:41.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you collaborate,
you get a better product.

00:14:41.397 --> 00:14:45.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s more direct, simpler,
and easier to understand.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, thinking ahead

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:49.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
about potential translation problems
and addressing them

00:14:49.338 --> 00:14:52.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped expedite translation
in hundreds of languages.

00:15:07.756 --> 00:15:09.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that Jehovah helped us

00:15:09.758 --> 00:15:11.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
accomplish this job
in a shorter amount of time

00:15:11.927 --> 00:15:13.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a quality
that would have been very difficult

00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:15.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
even under normal circumstances.

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:17.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
How amazing Jehovah is!

00:15:19.768 --> 00:15:23.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the Governing Body
wholeheartedly embracing the project

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:27.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everyone on the production team
willingly giving their all,

00:15:27.376 --> 00:15:30.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could see clear evidence
of Jehovah’s backing.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that we’ve seen
what Jehovah has wonderfully done for us,

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
what must we do for him?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,
Jesus’ command at Matthew 28:19, 20

00:15:41.657 --> 00:15:44.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
applies to all Christians.

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:46.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding that command,
note what the article

00:15:46.595 --> 00:15:49.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep Busy During the Last
of ‘the Last Days’” states

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:52.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the October 2019 issue of <i>The Watchtower: </i>

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As we conduct Bible studies,

00:15:56.405 --> 00:15:59.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have to try our best
to ‘make disciples . . . ,

00:15:59.508 --> 00:16:03.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“teaching them to observe
all the things [Jesus has] commanded.’

00:16:03.946 --> 00:16:07.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We need to help people understand
how important it is

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:10.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for them to take their stand
for Jehovah and his Kingdom.

00:16:10.786 --> 00:16:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This means trying to motivate people
to make the truth their own

00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:18.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by applying what they learn,
dedicating their life to Jehovah,

00:16:18.827 --> 00:16:20.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and getting baptized.

00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:24.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only then will they survive Jehovah’s day.”

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
In most parts of the earth,

00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:29.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
people are not waiting in line
for Bible studies.

00:16:29.538 --> 00:16:33.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to be proactive,
trying our best to find people

00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:36.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom we can start and conduct
progressive studies,

00:16:36.345 --> 00:16:38.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
using our interactive Bible course.

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:42.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want as many righthearted persons
as possible

00:16:42.184 --> 00:16:45.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become
Jehovah’s willing, loyal Witnesses.

00:16:46.055 --> 00:16:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are seven suggestions
you can write down now and try later.

00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:52.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really work!

00:16:52.061 --> 00:16:54.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first and most important is:

00:16:54.863 --> 00:16:57.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray for a Bible study.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:00.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never underestimate the power of prayer,

00:17:00.402 --> 00:17:05.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
so be specific in your prayers
and keep praying for studies.

00:17:05.374 --> 00:17:09.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work in harmony with your prayers
by offering studies at every opportunity,

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:12.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
including to your relatives
and acquaintances.

00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:17.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Show people the brochure.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:22.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use the intriguing question on the back cover
to pique their interest.

00:17:22.257 --> 00:17:27.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
It asks:
“Is it possible to enjoy life forever?”

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:30.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Offer to cover the three introductory lessons
in the brochure.

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:32.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that,
the person can decide

00:17:32.768 --> 00:17:33.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether to continue

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:36.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the rest of the Bible course
in the book.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Try the direct approach.

00:17:40.743 --> 00:17:42.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Introduce yourself as a Bible teacher,

00:17:42.845 --> 00:17:44.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come right out and ask people

00:17:44.847 --> 00:17:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether they would like
to learn more about the Bible.

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:52.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Explain that we have a most enjoyable
and easy interactive Bible course

00:17:52.354 --> 00:17:55.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that you have openings
in your teaching schedule.

00:17:56.592 --> 00:18:00.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) Ask your studies for referrals.

00:18:00.963 --> 00:18:04.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can do this while studying
the first paragraph of lesson 01.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:08.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
It asks: “Do you think that the Bible
can help anyone you know?”

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:14.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
If your student mentions a friend,
a relative, a neighbor, or a workmate,

00:18:14.243 --> 00:18:17.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
offer to demonstrate the course
to that person.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
(5) Approach meeting attenders.

00:18:21.784 --> 00:18:25.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t assume that interested ones
you see at congregation meetings

00:18:25.821 --> 00:18:27.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
are already studying.

00:18:27.556 --> 00:18:30.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask them,
and if they are not currently studying,

00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:32.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
offer to get them started.

00:18:33.395 --> 00:18:38.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
(6) Ask non-Witness marriage mates.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was the last time
they were offered a Bible study?

00:18:41.837 --> 00:18:44.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if they had declined an offer
in the past,

00:18:44.406 --> 00:18:46.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
they might be interested now.

00:18:46.408 --> 00:18:50.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they may prefer to study
with someone outside their family.

00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:55.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
And (7) talk to those who’ve studied before.

00:18:55.417 --> 00:18:59.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you study with someone years ago
in one of our other publications

00:18:59.354 --> 00:19:01.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
who did not make any progress?

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not contact them,

00:19:03.492 --> 00:19:06.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
explain that we have
a new interactive Bible course,

00:19:06.695 --> 00:19:09.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask if they’d like to study again?

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:14.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may be just what they need now
to act on what they learn.

00:19:15.804 --> 00:19:18.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
A key principle that applies to the efforts

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
we put forth in the Bible study work

00:19:20.542 --> 00:19:24.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
is found at Galatians 6:9, which says:

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:28.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So let us not give up in doing what is fine,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for in due time we will reap

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:32.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we do not tire out.”

00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:36.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may we never lose our enthusiasm
in making disciples

00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:39.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor relax our efforts.

00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:42.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s rich blessing
on our Bible study activity

00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:45.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
using <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:19:45.067 --> 00:19:47.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be able to say thankfully:

00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:50.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, . . . everything we have done

00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:52.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have accomplished for us”!
