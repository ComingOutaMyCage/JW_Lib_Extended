00:00:02 In our broadcast for this month,
00:00:04 we’re going to discuss the quality of patience.
00:00:09 Think of how many situations we encounter
00:00:11 that require patience:
00:00:14 waiting in rush-hour traffic,
00:00:16 dealing with a difficult coworker,
00:00:19 raising a child, overcoming marital problems,
00:00:23 coping with the illness of a loved one,
00:00:26 or maybe coping with an illness of our own.
00:00:30 Clearly, all of us face situations
00:00:34 that require us to display a measure of patience each day.
00:00:39 If we don’t have patience, we can become frustrated,
00:00:43 tired, and discouraged.
00:00:47 But no matter what our circumstances are,
00:00:50 all of us can develop this quality.
00:00:53 How do we know?
00:00:55 Because according to Galatians 5:22,
00:00:58 patience is an aspect of the fruitage of God’s spirit,
00:01:02 and with its help,
00:01:04 we can make this quality an integral part of our personality.
00:01:10 For this to happen, let’s now answer two important questions.
00:01:15 First, How can being patient
00:01:18 help us to express our love for Jehovah?
00:01:21 And second, How can being patient improve
00:01:24 our relationship with others?
00:01:27 Let’s start with our first question:
00:01:30 How can being patient help us to express our love for Jehovah?
00:01:35 Let’s consider what is stated in 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
00:01:40 This chapter gives us a description of how love manifests itself.
00:01:45 Please follow along as I read verse 4:
00:01:48 “Love is patient and kind.
00:01:51 “Love is not jealous.
00:01:53 It does not brag, does not get puffed up.”
00:01:57 Of all the many qualities that stem from love,
00:02:01 did you note which one is listed first?
00:02:04 Patience.
00:02:06 It is an integral aspect of love.
00:02:10 We need both love and patience in order to be successful
00:02:14 and ensure we’re on the right course, which includes pleasing Jehovah.
00:02:19 If we think of situations where a lack of patience was a factor,
00:02:24 we can usually identify where a lack of love was evident.
00:02:30 Take, for example, God’s chosen people, the nation of Israel.
00:02:35 In Psalm 106,
00:02:37 written many years after Israel’s deliverance from Egypt,
00:02:41 the psalmist indicates that they continued acting with a similar disposition.
00:02:47 Despite that,
00:02:49 Jehovah extended patience to them for many years.
00:02:54 Please follow along as I read Psalm 106:7, 8:
00:03:00 “Our forefathers in Egypt
00:03:02 “did not appreciate your wonderful works.
00:03:05 “They did not remember your abundant loyal love,
00:03:09 “but they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.
00:03:13 “But he saved them for the sake of his name,
00:03:16 to make his mightiness known.”
00:03:19 And what was the result?
00:03:21 Let’s read verse 13:
00:03:23 “But they quickly forgot what he did;
00:03:27 they did not wait for his counsel.”
00:03:33 How sad!
00:03:35 The people “did not wait.”
00:03:39 They were not patient.
00:03:42 And that highlights that they did not appreciate
00:03:44 Jehovah’s patience and loyal love.
00:03:47 Love for God should have caused them
00:03:49 to think about the consequences of their actions.
00:03:53 They should have remembered how Jehovah cared and provided for them.
00:03:57 That should have moved them to be patient
00:03:59 and wait on Jehovah’s direction.
00:04:02 But time and again,
00:04:04 their actions showed that they really didn’t love Jehovah as they should have.
00:04:08 And it cost them.
00:04:10 They eventually tested Jehovah’s patience to the limit
00:04:13 and, as a nation, lost his favor.
00:04:18 What can you and I learn from their example?
00:04:21 Never would we want to become independent of Jehovah,
00:04:25 trusting in our own thinking
00:04:27 and not patiently waiting for Jehovah’s counsel
00:04:30 to direct the decisions we make.
00:04:32 Think about how well we’ve been guided recently regarding the pandemic,
00:04:38 natural disasters,
00:04:41 and the organizing of our ministry.
00:04:43 Even if we didn’t fully understand
00:04:46 or even fully agree with all the decisions,
00:04:49 our love for God helped us to take the time
00:04:52 to think about Jehovah’s care for us and trust him.
00:04:59 By doing so, we learn that if we’re patient
00:05:01 and submit to Jehovah’s direction,
00:05:04 we won’t go off course
00:05:07 and we’ll benefit ourselves and others.
00:05:10 And in doing so,
00:05:12 we ultimately express our love for Jehovah.
00:05:18 Let’s now answer the second question:
00:05:21 How can being patient improve our relationship with others?
00:05:25 If we go back to 1 Corinthians 13:4,
00:05:29 the study note states:
00:05:32 “Patience is a quality that Jehovah and Jesus
00:05:35 “constantly show in their dealings with humans.
00:05:38 “As imitators of Jesus and Jehovah,
00:05:41 Christians are to show patience to others.”
00:05:46 So if Jehovah and Jesus are patient with us,
00:05:50 it would follow that we imitate their example and be patient with others.
00:05:56 Let’s start  with the greatest example, Jehovah.
00:06:01 Think about the patience he’s shown
00:06:03 in waiting to bring an end to this system.
00:06:07 Jehovah has a fixed day and hour when that will take place,
00:06:11 and he’s patiently waiting until that arrives.
00:06:14 He’s bound himself to his own timetable.
00:06:18 Now rest assured,
00:06:20 Jehovah is well aware of how we feel as his servants.
00:06:26 He knows that we wish the end of this system to come as soon as possible
00:06:31 and that we long to see the fulfillment of all his promises.
00:06:35 And he longs to fulfill them.
00:06:38 But he will not become impatient
00:06:42 and act before his appointed time.
00:06:46 Why should we appreciate Jehovah’s patience in that regard?
00:06:50 Please follow along as I read 2 Peter 3:15:
00:06:57 “Furthermore, consider the patience
00:07:00 “of our Lord as salvation,
00:07:03 “just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you
00:07:06 according to the wisdom given him.”
00:07:09 Isn’t that a powerful point?
00:07:12 Jehovah’s patience is the means for our salvation.
00:07:18 Think about the number of people who are learning the truth every year.
00:07:22 Even during the pandemic,
00:07:24 when we weren’t able to engage in our typical house-to-house witnessing,
00:07:28 tens of thousands of individuals still got baptized worldwide.
00:07:34 Perhaps some of those included your Bible students,
00:07:37 family members, close friends,
00:07:40 or maybe even you yourself.
00:07:43 And think about this:
00:07:45 If Jehovah had impatiently brought the end of this system
00:07:50 5, 10, or 20 years ago,
00:07:55 would you have learned the truth?
00:07:58 So we appreciate that Jehovah
00:08:00 is still patiently waiting for his day to arrive
00:08:05 and has allowed so many to attain to repentance
00:08:08 and develop a relationship with him.
00:08:12 How should this affect our relationship with others?
00:08:15 Perhaps it can help us to be more patient with a progressive Bible student
00:08:20 who still may be struggling with a problem.
00:08:22 Or maybe it’s still difficult for some of our relatives to see us
00:08:26 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and to adjust to our beliefs and lifestyle.
00:08:32 But in imitation of Jehovah’s patience,
00:08:35 we won’t give up on them.
00:08:39 And, of course, reflecting on Jehovah’s patience should move us
00:08:43 to continue to have a full share in the ministry,
00:08:46 earnestly looking for those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life”
00:08:51 and helping them to love Jehovah and serve him.
00:08:54 Then they too can benefit from Jehovah’s patience,
00:08:58 just as we have.
00:09:02 We can also learn from the example of Jesus.
00:09:06 He demonstrated tremendous patience when his disciples
00:09:09 were arguing among themselves as to who was the greatest.
00:09:12 This apparently happened on a number of occasions.
00:09:16 And no doubt, it saddened Jesus to hear this.
00:09:20 But Jesus was patient with them.
00:09:23 He showed empathy for them.
00:09:26 He knew how much the culture and the environment
00:09:29 in which they had been raised affected their thinking and attitude.
00:09:34 That knowledge caused him to react kindly.
00:09:38 Note one beautiful example.
00:09:40 Please read with me Mark chapter 9
00:09:44 —Mark 9:33, 35:
00:09:49 “And they came into Capernaum.
00:09:51 “Now when he was inside the house,
00:09:54 “he put the question to them:
00:09:56 ‘What were you arguing about on the road?’”
00:09:59 Well, we know the answer.
00:10:01 They had been arguing about who among them was the greater.
00:10:06 Look at verse 35:
00:10:08 “So he sat down and called the Twelve and said to them:
00:10:12 “‘If anyone wants to be first,
00:10:15 he must be last of all and minister of all.’”
00:10:19 Did you note what Jesus did?
00:10:22 He patiently waited for the right time
00:10:26 to correct them kindly.
00:10:29 He didn’t make a scene on the road.
00:10:31 Verse 33,
00:10:33 he waited until “he was inside the house,”
00:10:37 verse 35, ‘sitting down.’
00:10:42 He calmed the situation.
00:10:44 He didn’t push them.
00:10:46 Instead, he led them patiently by instruction
00:10:51 and by example.
00:10:54 What a great example in avoiding becoming provoked
00:10:57 and, instead of acting immediately,
00:11:01 waiting for the right time to address matters,
00:11:05 even when our patience is tested!
00:11:10 What else can we take away from Jesus’ example of patience?
00:11:13 If you’re a parent,
00:11:15 can you imitate the way that Jesus dealt with his apostles?
00:11:19 It may be frustrating if your children don’t respond immediately to your counsel
00:11:23 or if they’re slow in correcting their shortcomings.
00:11:27 Or perhaps you’re an elder
00:11:29 and someone you’re trying to help may be slow
00:11:32 in responding to Bible-based counsel.
00:11:35 But remember Jesus’ example.
00:11:38 He never gave up on his apostles.
00:11:41 He kept looking for the good,
00:11:44 expressing confidence in them,
00:11:46 and he patiently repeated lessons that they needed
00:11:49 so that they could draw closer to Jehovah.
00:11:53 If we do the same, not giving up,
00:11:57 our patience may eventually be rewarded as well.
00:12:01 So to review:
00:12:03 How can being patient help us to express our love for Jehovah?
00:12:07 It stops us from running ahead of Jehovah,
00:12:10 demonstrating our loyal love for him.
00:12:13 Waiting patiently for Jehovah’s direction and guidance
00:12:16 ensures that our course is pleasing to him.
00:12:20 And second, How can being patient improve our relationship with others?
00:12:26 It helps us to avoid acting rashly
00:12:29 and to look for the good in others
00:12:31 and express confidence in them.
00:12:36 Hopefully, this discussion will help us appreciate
00:12:38 the benefit of displaying patience in our lives.
00:12:42 With the increasing pressures of these last days,
00:12:44 we’ll need to display patience more than ever before!
00:12:49 Imitating the patience of Jehovah and Jesus
00:12:52 will help us keep the right attitude.
00:12:55 We won’t become overly discouraged or overwhelmed
00:12:58 by the present wickedness in this system
00:13:00 or even be impatient about when it will end.
00:13:05 Instead, we’ll stay on the right course:
00:13:09 keeping busy, working to develop a closer relationship with Jehovah,
00:13:13 and keeping active in our ministry,
00:13:15 helping others to learn about Jehovah
00:13:17 and benefit from his patience.
00:13:20 May all of us keep working
00:13:23 to make the quality of patience a dominant part of our personality.
00:13:27 As we do,
00:13:29 we will demonstrate how much we value and appreciate this wonderful quality
00:13:33 and bring all praise and honor to Jehovah!
