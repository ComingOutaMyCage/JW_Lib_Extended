In our broadcast for this month,

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:08.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to discuss
the quality of patience.

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.828 line:10% position:50% align:center
Think of how many situations we encounter

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:14.330 line:10% position:50% align:center
that require patience:

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
waiting in rush-hour traffic,

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with a difficult coworker,

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
raising a child,
overcoming marital problems,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
coping with the illness of a loved one,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe coping with an illness of our own.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, all of us face situations

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
that require us to display
a measure of patience each day.

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:43.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we don’t have patience,
we can become frustrated,

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:47.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
tired, and discouraged.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no matter what our circumstances are,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us can develop this quality.

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:55.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know?

00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:58.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because according to Galatians 5:22,

00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:02.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
patience is an aspect
of the fruitage of God’s spirit,

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:04.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with its help,

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:08.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can make this quality
an integral part of our personality.

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:15.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this to happen,
let’s now answer two important questions.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, How can being patient

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:21.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:24.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second, How can being patient improve

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:27.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
our relationship with others?

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:30.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start with our first question:

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can being patient
help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:40.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider what is stated
in 1 Corinthians chapter 13.

00:01:40.283 --> 00:01:45.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
This chapter gives us a description
of how love manifests itself.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along as I read verse 4:

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:51.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is patient and kind.

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:53.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is not jealous.

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:57.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not brag, does not get puffed up.”

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:01.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of all the many qualities
that stem from love,

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you note which one is listed first?

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Patience.

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is an integral aspect of love.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:14.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need both love and patience
in order to be successful

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:18.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ensure we’re on the right course,
which includes pleasing Jehovah.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:24.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we think of situations
where a lack of patience was a factor,

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:29.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can usually identify
where a lack of love was evident.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take, for example,
God’s chosen people, the nation of Israel.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Psalm 106,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
written many years
after Israel’s deliverance from Egypt,

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:46.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
the psalmist indicates that they continued
acting with a similar disposition.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite that,

00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:53.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah extended patience
to them for many years.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:59.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along as I read Psalm 106:7, 8:

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:02.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our forefathers in Egypt

00:03:02.498 --> 00:03:05.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
“did not appreciate your wonderful works.

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:09.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They did not remember
your abundant loyal love,

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they rebelled at the sea,
by the Red Sea.

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:16.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he saved them for the sake of his name,

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make his mightiness known.”

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what was the result?

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:23.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verse 13:

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:27.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But they quickly forgot what he did;

00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:31.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not wait for his counsel.”

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:35.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
How sad!

00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:38.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people “did not wait.”

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were not patient.

00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:44.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that highlights
that they did not appreciate

00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:47.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s patience and loyal love.

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:49.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love for God should have caused them

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:53.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think about the consequences
of their actions.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:57.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should have remembered
how Jehovah cared and provided for them.

00:03:57.287 --> 00:03:59.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
That should have moved them to be patient

00:03:59.756 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wait on Jehovah’s direction.

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
But time and again,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
their actions showed that they really didn’t
love Jehovah as they should have.

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it cost them.

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:13.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
They eventually tested
Jehovah’s patience to the limit

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, as a nation, lost his favor.

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:20.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can you and I learn from their example?

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:25.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never would we want
to become independent of Jehovah,

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting in our own thinking

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not patiently waiting
for Jehovah’s counsel

00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:32.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
to direct the decisions we make.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about how well we’ve been guided
recently regarding the pandemic,

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:40.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters,

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:43.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the organizing of our ministry.

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:46.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we didn’t fully understand

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:49.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even fully agree with all the decisions,

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:52.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love for God helped us to take the time

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:57.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think about Jehovah’s care for us
and trust him.

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:01.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so, we learn that if we’re patient

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:04.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and submit to Jehovah’s direction,

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t go off course

00:05:07.023 --> 00:05:10.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll benefit ourselves and others.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in doing so,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:16.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
we ultimately express our love for Jehovah.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now answer the second question:

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:25.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can being patient
improve our relationship with others?

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:29.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we go back to 1 Corinthians 13:4,

00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:32.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
the study note states:

00:05:32.115 --> 00:05:35.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Patience is a quality that Jehovah and Jesus

00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
“constantly show
in their dealings with humans.

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:41.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As imitators of Jesus and Jehovah,

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:45.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians are to show patience to others.”

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:50.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Jehovah and Jesus are patient with us,

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:55.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would follow that we imitate
their example and be patient with others.

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start 
with the greatest example, Jehovah.

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:03.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the patience he’s shown

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
in waiting to bring an end to this system.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:11.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has a fixed day and hour
when that will take place,

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s patiently waiting
until that arrives.

00:06:14.724 --> 00:06:18.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s bound himself to his own timetable.

00:06:18.728 --> 00:06:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now rest assured,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is well aware
of how we feel as his servants.

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:31.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that we wish the end of this system
to come as soon as possible

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we long
to see the fulfillment of all his promises.

00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:37.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he longs to fulfill them.

00:06:38.548 --> 00:06:42.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he will not become impatient

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and act before his appointed time.

00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:49.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should we appreciate
Jehovah’s patience in that regard?

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along as I read 2 Peter 3:15:

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, consider the patience

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:03.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of our Lord as salvation,

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as our beloved brother Paul
also wrote you

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:09.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the wisdom given him.”

00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:11.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a powerful point?

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:17.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s patience
is the means for our salvation.

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:22.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the number of people
who are learning the truth every year.

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:24.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even during the pandemic,

00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:28.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we weren’t able to engage
in our typical house-to-house witnessing,

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:33.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
tens of thousands of individuals
still got baptized worldwide.

00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:37.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps some of those
included your Bible students,

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:40.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
family members, close friends,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe even you yourself.

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:45.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about this:

00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah had impatiently
brought the end of this system

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
5, 10, or 20 years ago,

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you have learned the truth?

00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:00.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we appreciate that Jehovah

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:05.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
is still patiently waiting
for his day to arrive

00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:08.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has allowed
so many to attain to repentance

00:08:08.437 --> 00:08:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and develop a relationship with him.

00:08:12.508 --> 00:08:15.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should this affect
our relationship with others?

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:20.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps it can help us to be more patient
with a progressive Bible student

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:22.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
who still may be struggling with a problem.

00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:26.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe it’s still difficult
for some of our relatives to see us

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:31.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
and to adjust to our beliefs and lifestyle.

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:35.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in imitation of Jehovah’s patience,

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:38.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t give up on them.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:43.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, reflecting
on Jehovah’s patience should move us

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:46.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue
to have a full share in the ministry,

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:51.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
earnestly looking for those who
are “rightly disposed for everlasting life”

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:54.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helping them
to love Jehovah and serve him.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:58.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they too can benefit
from Jehovah’s patience,

00:08:58.554 --> 00:09:00.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as we have.

00:09:02.258 --> 00:09:05.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also learn from the example of Jesus.

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:09.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
He demonstrated tremendous patience
when his disciples

00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:12.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
were arguing among themselves
as to who was the greatest.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:16.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
This apparently happened
on a number of occasions.

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:20.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt,
it saddened Jesus to hear this.

00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus was patient with them.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:26.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed empathy for them.

00:09:26.515 --> 00:09:29.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew how much
the culture and the environment

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which they had been raised
affected their thinking and attitude.

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:37.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
That knowledge caused him to react kindly.

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:40.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note one beautiful example.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read with me Mark chapter 9

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark 9:33, 35:

00:09:49.038 --> 00:09:51.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they came into Capernaum.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now when he was inside the house,

00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:56.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he put the question to them:

00:09:56.946 --> 00:09:59.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What were you arguing about on the road?’”

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:01.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know the answer.

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:05.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had been arguing
about who among them was the greater.

00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:08.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at verse 35:

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he sat down
and called the Twelve and said to them:

00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If anyone wants to be first,

00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:19.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
he must be last of all and minister of all.’”

00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:22.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note what Jesus did?

00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:26.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
He patiently waited for the right time

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:29.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
to correct them kindly.

00:10:29.512 --> 00:10:31.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t make a scene on the road.

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 33,

00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:37.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
he waited until “he was inside the house,”

00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:40.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 35, ‘sitting down.’

00:10:42.191 --> 00:10:44.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
He calmed the situation.

00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:46.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t push them.

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:51.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he led them patiently by instruction

00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:53.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by example.

00:10:54.136 --> 00:10:57.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great example
in avoiding becoming provoked

00:10:57.707 --> 00:11:01.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, instead of acting immediately,

00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:05.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
waiting for the right time
to address matters,

00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:07.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when our patience is tested!

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:13.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
What else can we take away
from Jesus’ example of patience?

00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re a parent,

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you imitate the way
that Jesus dealt with his apostles?

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:23.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be frustrating if your children
don’t respond immediately to your counsel

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:27.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if they’re slow
in correcting their shortcomings.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:29.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps you’re an elder

00:11:29.972 --> 00:11:32.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and someone you’re trying to help may be slow

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:33.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
in responding to Bible-based counsel.

00:11:35.544 --> 00:11:38.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember Jesus’ example.

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:41.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
He never gave up on his apostles.

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:44.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
He kept looking for the good,

00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:46.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressing confidence in them,

00:11:46.555 --> 00:11:49.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he patiently repeated lessons
that they needed

00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:52.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they could draw closer to Jehovah.

00:11:53.262 --> 00:11:55.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do the same, not giving up,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
our patience may eventually
be rewarded as well.

00:12:01.404 --> 00:12:03.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to review:

00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:07.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can being patient help us
to express our love for Jehovah?

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:10.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
It stops us from running ahead of Jehovah,

00:12:10.746 --> 00:12:13.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
demonstrating our loyal love for him.

00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:16.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Waiting patiently
for Jehovah’s direction and guidance

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:19.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
ensures that our course is pleasing to him.

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:25.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second, How can being patient
improve our relationship with others?

00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:29.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to avoid acting rashly

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:31.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to look for the good in others

00:12:31.534 --> 00:12:33.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and express confidence in them.

00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:38.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hopefully, this discussion
will help us appreciate

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:42.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
the benefit of displaying
patience in our lives.

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the increasing pressures
of these last days,

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll need to display patience
more than ever before!

00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:52.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imitating the patience of Jehovah and Jesus

00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:55.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us keep the right attitude.

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:58.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t become
overly discouraged or overwhelmed

00:12:58.127 --> 00:13:00.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the present wickedness in this system

00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:05.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even be impatient about when it will end.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we’ll stay on the right course:

00:13:09.505 --> 00:13:13.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
keeping busy, working to develop
a closer relationship with Jehovah,

00:13:13.576 --> 00:13:15.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keeping active in our ministry,

00:13:15.578 --> 00:13:17.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping others to learn about Jehovah

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
and benefit from his patience.

00:13:20.516 --> 00:13:23.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all of us keep working

00:13:23.352 --> 00:13:27.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the quality of patience
a dominant part of our personality.

00:13:27.523 --> 00:13:29.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we do,

00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:33.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will demonstrate how much we value
and appreciate this wonderful quality

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:37.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring all praise and honor to Jehovah!
