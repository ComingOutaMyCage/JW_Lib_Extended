00:00:15 Our goal as teachers
00:00:17 is to help the person to become a disciple of Christ.
00:00:23 I want my student
00:00:24 to love Jehovah
00:00:25 the same way that I do.
00:00:27 What I most enjoy
00:00:28 is conducting Bible studies.
00:00:30 Being able to see
00:00:31 a student grow spiritually
00:00:33 is a joy that can’t be put into words.
00:00:36 The Watchtower  of January 2020
00:00:38 mentions several things that we need to keep in mind
00:00:41 as we conduct a study.
00:00:44 Studying the article,
00:00:46 I saw how many changes I needed to make when I conduct a Bible study.
00:00:50 It highlighted that besides helping the student to gain knowledge,
00:00:53 it’s even more important that we help them progress
00:00:56 to the point of dedicating their lives to Jehovah
00:00:59 and, of course, getting baptized.
00:01:01 Even though I read about how we should stop studying
00:01:04 with nonprogressive Bible studies,
00:01:06 I didn’t feel comfortable doing it
00:01:08 because I was afraid I might make the wrong decision.
00:01:12 Although I was pretty sure
00:01:14 that my Bible student wasn’t yet married
00:01:16 (that is legally married,
00:01:18 she had never told me this directly),
00:01:22 I just didn’t feel comfortable talking with her about it.
00:01:26 I had a Bible student who always prepared for
00:01:29 and commented well at the study.
00:01:30 I kept inviting her to the meetings,
00:01:32 but she never went to a single one,
00:01:35 and she never attended the Memorial.
00:01:38 I saw that she still had ties with some aspects of her religion.
00:01:45 The article brought out that in the first few weeks,
00:01:48 as soon as the study becomes regular,
00:01:50 it’s important to start praying with the student.
00:01:52 It used to take me a long time to start doing that.
00:01:57 The article helped me
00:01:58 because it encouraged me
00:02:00 to bring others with me on the study
00:02:02 and also not to be afraid
00:02:05 to bring along those who are more experienced.
00:02:08 In the article, it brought out how important it is
00:02:11 not just for us to pray with our students
00:02:13 but also to help them
00:02:15 to begin saying their own prayers as well.
00:02:19 After that, when the study became regular,
00:02:22 I’d pray before and after each session.
00:02:26 And I encouraged each of them
00:02:28 to also begin praying to Jehovah personally.
00:02:31 So praying became a daily habit for them.
00:02:34 A circuit overseer’s wife went with me on my study,
00:02:37 and she asked my student if she was married.
00:02:40 “Yes, I’m married.”
00:02:42 “But are you legally married?”
00:02:45 And then she responded, “No.”
00:02:48 So that really opened up an opportunity
00:02:51 for me to help the student out with this situation.
00:02:55 The article gave some suggestions
00:02:57 about how we need to pay attention to the student’s spiritual progress.
00:03:01 It really should be consistent.
00:03:04 We studied for a long time, a little over a year.
00:03:08 And that’s when I realized that it was time for me
00:03:11 to stop and decide if I should discontinue the study.
00:03:14 Then I put into practice the suggestion from The Watchtower  of January 2020.
00:03:19 I told her: “You really are someone who appreciates God’s Word,
00:03:23 “and you’re always regular with your studies.
00:03:25 “But like we just read about,
00:03:27 there’s some fruitage in your life that’s missing.”
00:03:30 But she responded,
00:03:32 “But I think it’s all in Jehovah’s time.”
00:03:34 So I said, “Jehovah has already invited you personally,
00:03:38 so it’s really up to you now.”
00:03:40 But she kept saying, “Well, to me,
00:03:42 it’ll happen in Jehovah’s time.”
00:03:45 Unfortunately,
00:03:47 it seemed better to discontinue the study
00:03:50 because she showed that she didn’t feel the need to make progress.
00:03:54 This article was a present from Jehovah.
00:03:57 It was like everything that was important
00:04:00 came all together in just one article.
00:04:02 We’re living in urgent times,
00:04:05 so we need to be as efficient as possible.
00:04:08 The spiritual progress a person makes,
00:04:10 which may have taken five years, can take place now.
