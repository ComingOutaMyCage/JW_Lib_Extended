00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:17.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal as teachers

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to help the person
to become a disciple of Christ.

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:24.670 line:10% position:50% align:center
I want my student

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.754 line:10% position:50% align:center
to love Jehovah

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:26.797 line:10% position:50% align:center
the same way that I do.

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:28.632 line:10% position:50% align:center
What I most enjoy

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:29.884 line:10% position:50% align:center
is conducting Bible studies.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:31.886 line:10% position:50% align:center
Being able to see

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:33.137 line:10% position:50% align:center
a student grow spiritually

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a joy that can’t be put into words.

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of January 2020

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentions several things
that we need to keep in mind

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:43.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we conduct a study.

00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:46.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Studying the article,

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:49.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how many changes I needed to make
when I conduct a Bible study.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
It highlighted that besides helping
the student to gain knowledge,

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:56.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s even more important
that we help them progress

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the point of dedicating
their lives to Jehovah

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course, getting baptized.

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I read
about how we should stop studying

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:06.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
with nonprogressive Bible studies,

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:08.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t feel comfortable doing it

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was afraid
I might make the wrong decision.

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although I was pretty sure

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:16.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
that my Bible student wasn’t yet married

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:18.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
(that is legally married,

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
she had never told me this directly),

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just didn’t feel comfortable
talking with her about it.

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:29.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a Bible student who always prepared for

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:30.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
and commented well at the study.

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:32.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
I kept inviting her to the meetings,

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:35.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she never went to a single one,

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:38.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she never attended the Memorial.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw that she still had ties
with some aspects of her religion.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:48.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article brought out
that in the first few weeks,

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:50.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
as soon as the study becomes regular,

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:52.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s important to start praying
with the student.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
It used to take me a long time
to start doing that.

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:58.681 line:10% position:50% align:center
The article helped me

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.015 line:10% position:50% align:center
because it encouraged me

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:01.934 line:10% position:50% align:center
to bring others with me on the study

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also not to be afraid

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:07.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring along those
who are more experienced.

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:11.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the article,
it brought out how important it is

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just for us to pray with our students

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:15.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to help them

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
to begin saying their own prayers as well.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, when the study became regular,

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:25.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d pray before and after each session.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I encouraged each of them

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
to also begin praying to Jehovah personally.

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:33.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
So praying became a daily habit for them.

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
A circuit overseer’s wife
went with me on my study,

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:40.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she asked my student
if she was married.

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, I’m married.”

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:44.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But are you legally married?”

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then she responded, “No.”

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that really opened up an opportunity

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:54.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
for me to help the student out
with this situation.

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:57.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article gave some suggestions

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how we need to pay attention
to the student’s spiritual progress.

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:03.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really should be consistent.

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:08.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
We studied for a long time,
a little over a year.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s when I realized
that it was time for me

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:14.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stop and decide
if I should discontinue the study.

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I put into practice the suggestion
from <i>The Watchtower</i>  of January 2020.

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:23.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told her: “You really are someone
who appreciates God’s Word,

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:25.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you’re always regular
with your studies.

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But like we just read about,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s some fruitage in your life
that’s missing.”

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she responded,

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I think it’s all in Jehovah’s time.”

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:38.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said,
“Jehovah has already invited you personally,

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:40.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
so it’s really up to you now.”

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:42.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she kept saying, “Well, to me,

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:45.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’ll happen in Jehovah’s time.”

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seemed better to discontinue the study

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she showed that she didn’t feel
the need to make progress.

00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
This article was a present from Jehovah.

00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:00.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like everything that was important

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
came all together in just one article.

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:05.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re living in urgent times,

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we need to be as efficient as possible.

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual progress a person makes,

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
which may have taken five years,
can take place now.
