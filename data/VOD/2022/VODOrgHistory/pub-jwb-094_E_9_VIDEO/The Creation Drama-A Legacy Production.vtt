00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:03.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the late 1920’s,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s servants in Germany

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:07.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
produced a Bible-based presentation

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:10.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
that attracted huge crowds.

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was called the “Creation Drama.”

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:18.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some 10,000 people came to see it

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:21.417 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the Berlin Sports Palace.

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what exactly was the “Creation Drama”?

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what efforts were made
so that its message of hope

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:33.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
might reach as many as possible?

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:37.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “Creation Drama” was the successor

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a previous work
called the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in the 1900’s,

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students,
as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then known,

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:52.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanted to reach as many as possible
with the Bible’s message.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
To attract people
and teach them Bible truths,

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:59.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
they combined recorded lectures
with visual aids

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the form of slides
and motion-picture film.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1914,

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
they began showing
the “Photo-Drama of Creation”

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:09.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
in city after city,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was seen by over nine million people

00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:16.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
in just the first year after its release.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by the 1920’s, after years of use,

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:24.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of the “Photo-Drama’s” glass slides
were broken.

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:26.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
The film was deteriorating,

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:29.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the equipment was wearing out.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:34.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students still wanted
to reach large audiences.

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:37.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in many lands

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
they began broadcasting
Bible-based programs on the radio.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in Central Europe,

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:51.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
governments restricted
this means of advertising the Kingdom hope.

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:54.259 line:10% position:50% align:center
The brothers in Germany realized

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.470 line:10% position:50% align:center
that a motion-picture presentation

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
similar to the “Photo-Drama”

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:01.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be the best way
for them to reach people.

00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:05.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little did they know
how timely their efforts would be.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1927,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Hans Decker
updated the “Photo-Drama” script

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
with information
from a new book entitled <i>Creation,</i>

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
even adopting the name “Creation Drama.”

00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:24.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Wilhelm Schumann
hand painted many new slides

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
using pictures from recent publications.

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:29.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
New film was also added.

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:32.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Erich Frost, a skilled musician,

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:35.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
composed music to accompany the program.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it was released,

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
the “Creation Drama” was eight hours long

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:45.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and designed to be presented
over several evenings.

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, Germany was suffering
severe economic depression,

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and people needed hope
to deal with the difficult conditions.

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the new political party,

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
the National Socialist, or Nazi party,

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:04.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
was gaining strength
under the leadership of Adolf Hitler.

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
What efforts were made

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the “Creation Drama’s” message
might reach as many as possible?

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:14.423 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 1928,

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:15.799 line:10% position:50% align:center
the brothers in Germany

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.218 line:10% position:50% align:center
began showing the “Creation Drama.”

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:20.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the five years after its release,

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:24.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
they showed it hundreds of times
to over a million people.

00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hitler opposed
the preaching work of the Bible Students,

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:33.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah’s people
kept on preaching courageously.

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martin Poetzinger reported:

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:38.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘One evening in Weissenburg, Bavaria,

00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:41.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘people were coming in droves
to see the drama,

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:44.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but the police blocked their entry.

00:03:44.328 --> 00:03:48.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And even though hundreds went
to demonstrate in front of the town hall,

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:50.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘the police continued blocking them.

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The next evening,

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:55.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘storm troopers showed up

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:57.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking to destroy the equipment.’

00:03:57.925 --> 00:03:59.802 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:02.054 line:10% position:50% align:center
continued showing the “Creation Drama”

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:04.515 line:10% position:50% align:center
until April 1933,

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:06.141 line:10% position:50% align:center
when the government started

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:08.143 line:10% position:50% align:center
imposing bans on their work.

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:10.646 line:10% position:50% align:center
In fact, in the last six months

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:12.689 line:10% position:50% align:center
that it was shown in Germany,

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.110 line:10% position:50% align:center
the brothers hosted 160 performances

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.780 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a total of nearly 300,000 attendees.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:22.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1931,

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:24.118 line:10% position:50% align:center
the brothers at the Central Europe branch

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:25.619 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Bern, Switzerland,

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:27.079 line:10% position:50% align:center
recognized the success

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.622 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the “Creation Drama”

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:31.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and requested permission
to develop similar programs

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
for use in the rest of Europe.

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:37.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even after the preaching work
was banned in Germany,

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Witnesses continued
to show the “Creation Drama”

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
in such places as Switzerland, France,

00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:45.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Netherlands, Austria,

00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:48.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.

00:04:49.518 --> 00:04:52.187 line:10% position:50% align:center
As conditions changed across Europe,

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:54.231 line:10% position:50% align:center
the “Creation Drama” was updated

00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:56.400 line:10% position:50% align:center
to include new developments.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.860 line:10% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.237 line:10% position:50% align:center
when a brave family smuggled information

00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:02.239 line:10% position:50% align:center
from Germany into Switzerland

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:04.700 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.828 line:10% position:50% align:center
this news was added to the “Creation Drama.”

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:12.416 line:10% position:50% align:center
As the clergy aligned themselves

00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:14.418 line:10% position:50% align:center
with Hitler’s Nazi party,

00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:17.129 line:10% position:50% align:center
this fact was also included in the drama.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.882 line:10% position:50% align:center
And when Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:22.676 line:10% position:50% align:center
were arrested for taking a neutral stand,

00:05:22.676 --> 00:05:24.678 line:10% position:50% align:center
this too was added.

00:05:25.345 --> 00:05:27.556 line:10% position:50% align:center
The brothers in Switzerland reported

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:30.309 line:10% position:50% align:center
the last known use of the “Creation Drama.”

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:32.978 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 1939,

00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:34.980 line:10% position:50% align:center
there were 20 performances

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.649 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a total attendance of 19,000.

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:41.445 line:10% position:50% align:center
Months later,

00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:44.198 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Second World War began.

00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:52.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 1914,
just before the First World War,

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
the “Photo-Drama of Creation”

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
had acquainted millions
with the Bible’s message.

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.631 line:10% position:50% align:center
From 1928 to 1939,

00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:02.925 line:10% position:50% align:center
as the Second World War approached,

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:04.927 line:10% position:50% align:center
the “Creation Drama” was shown

00:06:04.927 --> 00:06:08.055 line:10% position:50% align:center
just in time to make an indelible impression

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:11.475 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the minds and hearts of those who saw it.

00:06:12.726 --> 00:06:15.771 line:10% position:50% align:center
Many described it as unforgettable.

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:20.817 line:10% position:50% align:center
It did more than just inform people

00:06:20.817 --> 00:06:23.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
of God’s promises;

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:24.905 line:10% position:50% align:center
it motivated many

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:27.282 line:10% position:50% align:center
to put faith in the Kingdom hope

00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:30.619 line:10% position:50% align:center
in spite of the dark shadows of war.

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:34.623 line:10% position:50% align:center
The “Creation Drama” also encouraged

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:37.209 line:10% position:50% align:center
thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Europe.

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:41.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they were persecuted and imprisoned,

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:44.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
they continued to teach others

00:06:44.174 --> 00:06:47.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the Bible’s promises for the future.
