00:00:02 Peace is often defined
00:00:05 as the absence of conflict.
00:00:08 But peace involves much more.
00:00:12 The truth is, we each face trials
00:00:15 that can rob us of peace:
00:00:18 illness,
00:00:20 economic problems,
00:00:24 our own weaknesses,
00:00:27 damaged relationships.
00:00:34 What threatens your peace?
00:00:40 At the 2022 “Pursue Peace”! Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:44 you will discover how you can find
00:00:47 real, lasting peace in your life right now!
