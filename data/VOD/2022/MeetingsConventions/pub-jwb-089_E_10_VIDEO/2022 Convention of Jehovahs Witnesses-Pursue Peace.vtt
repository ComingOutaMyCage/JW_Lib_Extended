Peace is often defined

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:08.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the absence of conflict.

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:12.033 line:90% position:50% align:center

that can rob us of peace:

illness,

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
economic problems,

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:27.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
our own weaknesses,

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
damaged relationships.
