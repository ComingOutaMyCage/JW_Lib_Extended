00:00:06 In today’s world, there’s a constant flood of information
00:00:10 coming at you from just about everywhere.
00:00:13 It’s good to stay informed.
00:00:15 The problem is that not everything you hear or see is true.
00:00:20 Some of it is misinformation:
00:00:23 opinions,
00:00:24 half-truths,
00:00:26 conspiracy theories,
00:00:27 and even outright lies dressed up as facts.
00:00:31 Misinformation isn’t just inaccurate;
00:00:33 it can also be dangerous!
00:00:36 It can cause people to make bad decisions
00:00:41 or to ignore important safety warnings.
00:00:45 So how can you protect yourself from misinformation?
00:00:50 At Job 12:11,
00:00:53 the Bible says that we should “test out words
00:00:56 as the tongue tastes food.”
00:00:58 When you taste something new,
00:01:00 you can spit it out if it’s bad
00:01:03 before you swallow it.
00:01:05 In the same way,
00:01:07 before you believe a story or repeat it to others,
00:01:10 you should put it to the test.
00:01:13 Here are two ways you can do that.
00:01:15 Test number one: Consider the source of the information.
00:01:20 Do you know where the information originally came from?
00:01:24 Don’t be fooled by appearances.
00:01:26 An online post may look official.
00:01:29 But behind the scenes,
00:01:31 the author may just be repeating rumors
00:01:33 or spreading his own opinions.
00:01:36 And with something called deepfake technology,
00:01:39 dishonest people can even do things
00:01:42 like swap the faces and voices in a video
00:01:45 to create a completely fake report.
00:01:48 So even if a story is widely repeated,
00:01:51 follow the Bible’s advice
00:01:53 of 1 Thessalonians 5:21
00:01:56 and “make sure of all things.”
00:01:59 Compare what you hear with other sources
00:02:02 to verify the information.
00:02:05 Test number two: Consider the purpose of a story.
00:02:10 Is it really to present the facts
00:02:12 or to promote just one side of an issue?
00:02:16 Some reports spin the news,
00:02:18 emphasizing certain details and downplaying others
00:02:22 to sway your opinion.
00:02:24 Some reports may even be conspiracy theories
00:02:28 —claims that certain groups have secretly plotted
00:02:31 to cause a tragic event or crisis.
00:02:33 The purpose is often to promote prejudice and hatred.
00:02:38 Such theories have a way of spreading like wildfire.
00:02:42 But they are just that —theories.
00:02:45 And sometimes they’re based on deliberate lies,
00:02:49 so don’t be fooled.
00:02:51 But before you spend time and effort testing everything you hear,
00:02:55 there’s an important question you need to ask yourself,
00:02:59 ‘Is the story really that important to me?’
00:03:02 Splashy headlines can make even trivial news items seem important.
00:03:08 But if you follow every bit of information that pops up,
00:03:11 you just may hit information overload
00:03:14 or get stressed out about reports
00:03:16 that are more speculation than actual news.
00:03:19 If you feel overwhelmed,
00:03:22 it may help to turn off some notifications
00:03:25 and just search for the information you need
00:03:27 when you need it.
00:03:29 Of course, even if you’re not online,
00:03:32 misinformation can spread by word of mouth.
00:03:35 Even well-meaning friends
00:03:38 may just repeat what they’ve heard.
00:03:43 So whether you read something,
00:03:46 hear it from another person,
00:03:47 or it’s forwarded to you by a friend,
00:03:49 remember the words of Proverbs 14:15:
00:03:53 “The naive person believes every word,
00:03:57 but the shrewd one ponders each step.”
00:04:01 In other words, don’t just believe everything you hear
00:04:04 without thinking it through.
00:04:06 But that doesn’t mean we can’t trust anything or anyone.
00:04:10 If you hear something that makes you anxious or suspicious,
00:04:14 go to someone you trust
00:04:17 —someone with more experience
00:04:19 who can help you evaluate the truth behind it.
00:04:24 By taking the time to evaluate information sources,
00:04:27 by considering the purpose behind the reports you hear,
00:04:31 and by not getting bogged down with news you don’t really need,
00:04:35 you’ll be well-informed instead of misinformed,
00:04:39 and that will help you make good decisions and stay safe.
