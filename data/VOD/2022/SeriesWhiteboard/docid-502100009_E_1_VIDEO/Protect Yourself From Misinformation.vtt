In today’s world,
there’s a constant flood of information

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
coming at you from just about everywhere.

00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:15.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good to stay informed.

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:19.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
The problem is that not everything
you hear or see is true.

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:23.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of it is misinformation:

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:24.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
opinions,

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
half-truths,

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
conspiracy theories,

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:30.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even outright lies dressed up as facts.

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:33.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Misinformation isn’t just inaccurate;

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can also be dangerous!

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:39.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can cause people to make bad decisions

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to ignore important safety warnings.

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:49.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can you protect yourself
from misinformation?

00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:53.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Job 12:11,

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:56.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible says
that we should “test out words

00:00:56.504 --> 00:00:58.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the tongue tastes food.”

00:00:58.798 --> 00:01:00.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you taste something new,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can spit it out if it’s bad

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:05.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
before you swallow it.

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the same way,

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:10.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
before you believe a story
or repeat it to others,

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should put it to the test. 

00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:15.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are two ways you can do that.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Test number one:
Consider the source of the information.

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:23.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know where
the information originally came from?

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:26.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be fooled by appearances.

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:29.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
An online post may look official.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
But behind the scenes,

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
the author may just be repeating rumors

00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:36.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
or spreading his own opinions.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with something
called deepfake technology,

00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:42.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
dishonest people can even do things

00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
like swap the faces and voices in a video

00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:48.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
to create a completely fake report.

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even if a story is widely repeated,

00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:53.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
follow the Bible’s advice

00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:56.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 1 Thessalonians 5:21

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “make sure of all things.”

00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:02.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Compare what you hear with other sources

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:04.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
to verify the information.

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:10.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Test number two:
Consider the purpose of a story.

00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it really to present the facts

00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:16.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to promote just one side of an issue?

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some reports spin the news,

00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:22.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
emphasizing certain details
and downplaying others

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:24.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
to sway your opinion.

00:02:24.483 --> 00:02:28.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some reports may even be conspiracy theories

00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:31.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
—claims that certain groups
have secretly plotted

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:33.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cause a tragic event or crisis.

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:38.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
The purpose is often
to promote prejudice and hatred.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:42.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such theories have a way
of spreading like wildfire.

00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:44.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they are just that
—theories.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes
they’re based on deliberate lies,

00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:51.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
so don’t be fooled.

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:55.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before you spend time and effort
testing everything you hear,

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:59.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s an important question
you need to ask yourself,

00:02:59.691 --> 00:03:02.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is the story really that important to me?’

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Splashy headlines can make
even trivial news items seem important.

00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:11.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you follow
every bit of information that pops up,

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:14.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
you just may hit information overload

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
or get stressed out about reports

00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:19.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are more speculation than actual news.

00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:22.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you feel overwhelmed,

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:25.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may help to turn off some notifications

00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:27.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just search for the information you need

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you need it.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:32.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, even if you’re not online,

00:03:32.396 --> 00:03:35.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
misinformation can spread by word of mouth.

00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:38.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even well-meaning friends

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:40.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
may just repeat what they’ve heard.

00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whether you read something,

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:47.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
hear it from another person,

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:49.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
or it’s forwarded to you by a friend,

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember the words of Proverbs 14:15:

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The naive person believes every word,

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:01.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the shrewd one ponders each step.”

00:04:01.013 --> 00:04:04.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
don’t just believe everything you hear

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
without thinking it through.

00:04:06.103 --> 00:04:10.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that doesn’t mean
we can’t trust anything or anyone.

00:04:10.858 --> 00:04:14.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you hear something
that makes you anxious or suspicious,

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to someone you trust

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:19.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
—someone with more experience

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:22.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can help you
evaluate the truth behind it.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
By taking the time
to evaluate information sources,

00:04:27.753 --> 00:04:31.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
by considering the purpose
behind the reports you hear,

00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:35.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by not getting bogged down
with news you don’t really need,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll be well-informed
instead of misinformed,

00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:43.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will help you
make good decisions and stay safe.
