Well, every day in high school,

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.199 line:10% position:50% align:center
my classmates would talk about sex.

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.243 line:10% position:50% align:center
They would just talk about, you know,

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:15.953 line:10% position:50% align:center
their boyfriends and girlfriends

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:19.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what they did with them,
you know, over the weekend

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they’re going to do.

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
They, of course, knew
that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:25.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I wouldn’t engage in premarital sex,

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:27.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that did not stop them from pushing.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guys would invade my personal space.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes they would even try

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
to, you know, grab or touch me.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, a girl in class asked me
to touch her inappropriately.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, I rejected her,

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she even started
or resorted to calling me names.

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:47.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
She called me lame,
and she said that I must be gay.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:51.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seemed to be a game to them
to try to break me

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and try to get me
to do things with them.

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact that I wouldn’t give in,

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
they thought it was fun or funny.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
It got to the point
where this became very physical.

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had two classmates
behind me that were pushing me.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
One classmate on each side of me
was grabbing my arms

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:09.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pushing me,
trying to make me touch her.

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that it was time to get out of there.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was already very different in school,

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I was also very shy.

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:24.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at times, I wanted to fit in

00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the crowd so that I wouldn’t have
that attention on me.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:31.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I knew that this would displease Jehovah

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
if I, you know, went with the crowd
and did what the other kids were doing.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I did say a quick,
silent prayer to Jehovah;

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Jehovah, just please help me.”

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:41.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
I immediately in my mind thought of Joseph.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was able to free himself
from Potiphar’s wife,

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was able to get away
because of his resolve to please Jehovah.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly
what I knew I needed to do.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I did just that
—I ran right out of the classroom.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personal study was very important.

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:01.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made Jehovah really real to me.

00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:03.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more real he was to me,

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:07.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more I didn’t want
to displease him and hurt him.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having that relationship with him
and having that trust in him

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
really helped me get through those situations

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:17.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
of wanting to fit in
and going with the crowd.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rejecting that girl was not easy,

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I did know
that it was the right thing to do.

00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:24.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly before this incident,

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
my grandmother actually prepared me.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
She would prepare <i>Watchtower</i>  articles for me

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:32.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
that talked about
how to deal with temptation.

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although those talks with her
were super-duper awkward,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
if I’m being honest, they really helped me

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay spiritually strong
and to resist the temptation.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents always told me
to use farsighted wisdom

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:51.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to think about how
that action would affect me

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the future,
affect my relationship with Jehovah

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with my friends and my family.

00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:01.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
That definitely went
through my head a lot during that time.

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:03.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
All you need to do is trust in Jehovah,

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:06.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if you trust in him,

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:08.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
then everything is going to be OK.

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
The publication
that really helped me the most

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the <i>Young People Ask</i>  book, Volume 2,

00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:17.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 5, “Why Stay a Virgin?”

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
This book was really a lifesaver for me.

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading about how some
of my peers all around the world

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
are dealing with the exact same temptation

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
really gave me a sense of comfort

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:30.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped me to feel that I was not alone.

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:35.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m really grateful
to Jehovah and the organization

00:03:35.277 --> 00:03:39.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the love that they show to us young ones

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:42.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to help us not feel alone and to help us

00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:46.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
push through these difficult situations.

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:48.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Young People Ask</i>  book, Volume 2,

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:53.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 14,
“How Can I Protect Myself at School?”

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:55.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
really encouraged me in school

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be firm and to stand my ground
to make Jehovah happy.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m so thankful to Jehovah
for recalling scriptures

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:06.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
like 1 Corinthians 6:18,

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says: “Flee from sexual immorality!”

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m happy to say
that I was able to do just that.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:14.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, really, what makes me the happiest

00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:16.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
is knowing that I made Jehovah happy,

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:19.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there is no greater feeling than that.
