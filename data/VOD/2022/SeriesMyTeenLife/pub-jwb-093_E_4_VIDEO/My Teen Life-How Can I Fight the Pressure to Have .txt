00:00:07 Well, every day in high school,
00:00:09 my classmates would talk about sex.
00:00:12 They would just talk about, you know,
00:00:14 their boyfriends and girlfriends
00:00:15 —what they did with them, you know, over the weekend
00:00:19 and what they’re going to do.
00:00:20 They, of course, knew that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:22 and that I wouldn’t engage in premarital sex,
00:00:25 but that did not stop them from pushing.
00:00:27 Guys would invade my personal space.
00:00:30 Sometimes they would even try
00:00:32 to, you know, grab or touch me.
00:00:34 One day, a girl in class asked me to touch her inappropriately.
00:00:39 Of course, I rejected her,
00:00:41 but she even started or resorted to calling me names.
00:00:43 She called me lame, and she said that I must be gay.
00:00:47 It seemed to be a game to them to try to break me
00:00:51 and try to get me to do things with them.
00:00:54 But the fact that I wouldn’t give in,
00:00:56 they thought it was fun or funny.
00:00:59 It got to the point where this became very physical.
00:01:02 I had two classmates behind me that were pushing me.
00:01:05 One classmate on each side of me was grabbing my arms
00:01:07 and pushing me, trying to make me touch her.
00:01:09 I knew that it was time to get out of there.
00:01:12 Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:15 I was already very different in school,
00:01:18 but I was also very shy.
00:01:21 So at times, I wanted to fit in
00:01:24 with the crowd so that I wouldn’t have that attention on me.
00:01:28 But I knew that this would displease Jehovah
00:01:31 if I, you know, went with the crowd and did what the other kids were doing.
00:01:34 Well, I did say a quick, silent prayer to Jehovah;
00:01:37 I said, “Jehovah, just please help me.”
00:01:39 I immediately in my mind thought of Joseph.
00:01:41 He was able to free himself from Potiphar’s wife,
00:01:45 but he was able to get away because of his resolve to please Jehovah.
00:01:49 And that’s exactly what I knew I needed to do.
00:01:51 And I did just that —I ran right out of the classroom.
00:01:55 Personal study was very important.
00:01:59 This made Jehovah really real to me.
00:02:01 The more real he was to me,
00:02:03 the more I didn’t want to displease him and hurt him.
00:02:07 Having that relationship with him and having that trust in him
00:02:11 really helped me get through those situations
00:02:14 of wanting to fit in and going with the crowd.
00:02:17 Rejecting that girl was not easy,
00:02:20 but I did know that it was the right thing to do.
00:02:22 Shortly before this incident,
00:02:24 my grandmother actually prepared me.
00:02:26 She would prepare Watchtower  articles for me
00:02:29 that talked about how to deal with temptation.
00:02:32 Although those talks with her were super-duper awkward,
00:02:36 if I’m being honest, they really helped me
00:02:38 to stay spiritually strong and to resist the temptation.
00:02:41 My parents always told me to use farsighted wisdom
00:02:46 —to think about how that action would affect me
00:02:51 in the future, affect my relationship with Jehovah
00:02:54 and with my friends and my family.
00:02:57 That definitely went through my head a lot during that time.
00:03:01 All you need to do is trust in Jehovah,
00:03:03 because if you trust in him,
00:03:06 then everything is going to be OK.
00:03:08 The publication that really helped me the most
00:03:11 was the Young People Ask  book, Volume 2,
00:03:14 chapter 5, “Why Stay a Virgin?”
00:03:17 This book was really a lifesaver for me.
00:03:20 Reading about how some of my peers all around the world
00:03:23 are dealing with the exact same temptation
00:03:26 really gave me a sense of comfort
00:03:28 and helped me to feel that I was not alone.
00:03:30 Well, I’m really grateful to Jehovah and the organization
00:03:35 for the love that they show to us young ones
00:03:39 —to help us not feel alone and to help us
00:03:42 push through these difficult situations.
00:03:46 The Young People Ask  book, Volume 2,
00:03:48 chapter 14, “How Can I Protect Myself at School?”
00:03:53 really encouraged me in school
00:03:55 to be firm and to stand my ground to make Jehovah happy.
00:04:00 Well, I’m so thankful to Jehovah for recalling scriptures
00:04:04 like 1 Corinthians 6:18,
00:04:06 which says: “Flee from sexual immorality!”
00:04:09 And I’m happy to say that I was able to do just that.
00:04:12 But, really, what makes me the happiest
00:04:14 is knowing that I made Jehovah happy,
00:04:16 and there is no greater feeling than that.
