The last time we were here,
we promised to return

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:11.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show you a scripture
that can give us real hope.

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:13.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I’m interested in seeing that.

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:14.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here at Revelation 21:3, 4.

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Susan, would you please read that?

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:21.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With that I heard a loud voice
from the throne say:

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! The tent of God is with mankind,

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and he will reside with them,
and they will be his people.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And God himself will be with them.

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And he will wipe out
every tear from their eyes,

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and death will be no more,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘neither will mourning
nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The former things have passed away.’”

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does this say that God will do?

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that he’ll wipe out our tears,

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take away death, and take away pain.

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:58.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the problems
that can make life seem hopeless today

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:06.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such as poverty, injustice,
sickness, even death—

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will no longer exist.

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:18.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever read those words?

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! I’ve never seen them before.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people aren’t aware
of the gems contained in God’s Word

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they feel
it’s too difficult to understand.

00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:31.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time,
I’d like to discuss the question,

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we understand the Bible?

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would next Friday evening work for you?

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:43.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I should be home.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:48.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we go, perhaps we can exchange
our contact information.
