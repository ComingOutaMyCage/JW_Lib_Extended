00:00:06 The last time we were here, we promised to return
00:00:08 and show you a scripture that can give us real hope.
00:00:11 Yeah, I’m interested in seeing that.
00:00:13 Great.
00:00:14 It’s here at Revelation 21:3, 4.
00:00:17 Susan, would you please read that?
00:00:19 Sure.
00:00:21 “With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say:
00:00:24 “‘Look! The tent of God is with mankind,
00:00:27 “‘and he will reside with them, and they will be his people.
00:00:30 “‘And God himself will be with them.
00:00:32 “‘And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes,
00:00:36 “‘and death will be no more,
00:00:38 “‘neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.
00:00:42 The former things have passed away.’”
00:00:45 Thank you.
00:00:46 So, what does this say that God will do?
00:00:49 It says that he’ll wipe out our tears,
00:00:53 take away death, and take away pain.
00:00:56 Exactly.
00:00:58 All of the problems that can make life seem hopeless today
00:01:01 —such as poverty, injustice, sickness, even death—
00:01:06 will no longer exist.
00:01:16 Have you ever read those words?
00:01:18 No! I’ve never seen them before.
00:01:21 Many people aren’t aware of the gems contained in God’s Word
00:01:25 because they feel it’s too difficult to understand.
00:01:29 The next time, I’d like to discuss the question,
00:01:31 How can we understand the Bible?
00:01:39 Would next Friday evening work for you?
00:01:42 Yeah, I should be home.
00:01:43 Great.
00:01:44 Before we go, perhaps we can exchange our contact information.
