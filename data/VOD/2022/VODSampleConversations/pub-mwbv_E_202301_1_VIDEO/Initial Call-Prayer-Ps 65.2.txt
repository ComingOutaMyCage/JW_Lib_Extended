00:00:08 Many people wonder if God really listens to prayers.
00:00:12 What are your thoughts?
00:00:14 I think he does.
00:00:23 I believe so too because of what it says here in the Bible.
00:00:27 Notice how God is described at Psalm 65:2:
00:00:33 “O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come.”
00:00:38 So how is God described in this verse?
00:00:41 As a “Hearer of prayer.”
00:00:43 Yes.
00:00:45 What a difference from many people
00:00:47 in positions of authority who are inaccessible!
00:00:50 And based on what we read,
00:00:52 do you think God expects us to pray to him in a specific language?
00:00:55 Hmm, I don’t think so.
00:00:58 That’s exactly right.
00:01:00 This verse says that God hears the prayers of “people of all sorts,”
00:01:04 or people who speak different languages.
00:01:07 No matter what language we pray in,
00:01:09 we can express to him what’s in our heart,
00:01:12 and he understands us.
00:01:14 As our Father, he cares about each one of us.
00:01:25 This publication discusses other important aspects of prayer.
00:01:28 If you’d like to read it, I’d be happy to leave it with you.
00:01:31 Sure.
00:01:33 And the next time I’m here,
00:01:35 we can discuss the kinds of things we can pray about.
00:01:37 When can I speak with you again?
