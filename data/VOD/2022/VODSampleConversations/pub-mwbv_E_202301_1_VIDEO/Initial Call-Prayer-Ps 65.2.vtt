Many people wonder
if God really listens to prayers.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are your thoughts?

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:16.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think he does.

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
I believe so too
because of what it says here in the Bible.

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:32.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how God is described at Psalm 65:2:

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:38.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Hearer of prayer,
to you people of all sorts will come.”

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how is God described in this verse?

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a “Hearer of prayer.”

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:45.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a difference from many people

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
in positions of authority
who are inaccessible!

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:52.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
And based on what we read,

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you think God expects us
to pray to him in a specific language?

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:58.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I don’t think so.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s exactly right.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:04.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
This verse says that God
hears the prayers of “people of all sorts,”

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
or people who speak different languages.

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what language we pray in,

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can express to him what’s in our heart,

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he understands us.

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our Father, he cares about each one of us.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
This publication discusses
other important aspects of prayer.

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:31.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d like to read it,
I’d be happy to leave it with you.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the next time I’m here,

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can discuss
the kinds of things we can pray about.

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
When can I speak with you again?
