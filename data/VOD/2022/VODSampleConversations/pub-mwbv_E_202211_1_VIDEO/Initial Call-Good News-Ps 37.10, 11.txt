00:00:06 We’re making brief visits on our neighbors
00:00:08 because many are interested in a better world.
00:00:11 Do you think it’s realistic that one day
00:00:13 there will be an end to violence and war?
00:00:16 An end to violence and war?
00:00:19 Yeah, that’s probably not realistic.
00:00:22 May I ask why you feel that way?
00:00:24 Well, the world has always had violence and war.
00:00:28 I think the best we can hope for is just to limit those things.
00:00:32 I think a lot of people feel that way.
00:00:35 May we share something that the Scriptures say on the subject?
00:00:38 Sure.
00:00:39 Susan, would you please read Psalm 37:10, 11?
00:00:43 Sure.
00:00:44 It says: “Just a little while longer,
00:00:47 “and the wicked will be no more;
00:00:50 “you will look at where they were,
00:00:52 “and they will not be there.
00:00:54 “But the meek will possess the earth,
00:00:57 and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”
00:01:01 Thank you.
00:01:03 So according to this, who will not be any more?
00:01:08 It says “the wicked” won’t be here.
00:01:10 That’s right.
00:01:12 And without the influence of the wicked, what would be the result?
00:01:17 Peace.
00:01:18 Does it not seem logical that if the wicked are gone
00:01:21 then violence and war would end?
00:01:25 It makes sense.
00:01:27 I hope it’ll be a reality some day.
00:01:34 I agree.
00:01:36 Of course, it’s not realistic to think that man could accomplish this.
00:01:40 But this verse is describing what God Almighty will do.
00:01:44 The Bible contains many other encouraging promises.
00:01:47 The next time, I’d like to share with you the Bible’s promise
00:01:51 to end the problems that make life seem hopeless.
00:01:54 Sure.
