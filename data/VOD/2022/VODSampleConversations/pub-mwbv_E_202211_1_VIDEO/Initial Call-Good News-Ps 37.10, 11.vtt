We’re making brief visits on our neighbors

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because many are interested
in a better world.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think it’s realistic that one day

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:16.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there will be an end to violence and war?

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:19.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An end to violence and war?

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s probably not realistic.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May I ask why you feel that way?

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the world has always had
violence and war.

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the best we can hope for
is just to limit those things.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think a lot of people feel that way.

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:38.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we share something
that the Scriptures say on the subject?

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Susan, would you please read
Psalm 37:10, 11?

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:44.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:44.732 --> 00:00:47.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Just a little while longer,

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:50.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the wicked will be no more;

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will look at where they were,

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will not be there.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the meek will possess the earth,

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:01.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will find exquisite delight
in the abundance of peace.”

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to this,
who will not be any more?

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says “the wicked” won’t be here.

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:12.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:15.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And without the influence of the wicked,
what would be the result?

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peace.

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:21.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it not seem logical
that if the wicked are gone

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then violence and war would end?

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes sense.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope it’ll be a reality some day.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I agree.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:40.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it’s not realistic to think
that man could accomplish this.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this verse is describing
what God Almighty will do.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible contains
many other encouraging promises.

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time, I’d like to share with you
the Bible’s promise

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:54.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to end the problems
that make life seem hopeless.

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.
