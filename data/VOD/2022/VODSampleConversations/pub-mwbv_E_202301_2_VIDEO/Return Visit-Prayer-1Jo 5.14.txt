00:00:08 It’s good to see you again, Isabel.
00:00:10 The last time we spoke,
00:00:12 I left you with the question, What can we pray about?
00:00:16 The Bible answers that question for us at 1 John 5:14.
00:00:20 Would you mind reading that aloud for us, please?
00:00:23 Sure.
00:00:24 It says: “And this is the confidence that we have toward him,
00:00:29 that no matter what we ask according to his will, he hears us.”
00:00:41 Thank you.
00:00:43 You know, people believe different things regarding prayer.
00:00:46 But based on this verse, do you think God would answer our prayer
00:00:49 if we asked him for a million dollars?
00:00:52 Probably not.
00:00:53 Why not?
00:00:55 “No matter what we ask . . .”
00:00:57 “. . . according to his will . . .”
00:00:59 That’s right.
00:01:01 We can pray for anything in harmony with God’s will.
00:01:04 What about asking him to give us wisdom to do what’s right?
00:01:07 Sure.
00:01:08 We can ask him for that.
00:01:10 Yes, that’s certainly in harmony with God’s will, right?
00:01:14 The next time we talk, let’s discuss how God answers our prayers.
00:01:18 I’d like that.
