It’s good to see you again, Isabel.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last time we spoke,

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
I left you with the question,
What can we pray about?

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:20.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible answers that question for us
at 1 John 5:14.

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:23.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you mind
reading that aloud for us, please?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “And this is the confidence
that we have toward him,

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:34.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no matter what we ask
according to his will, he hears us.”

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, people believe
different things regarding prayer.

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:49.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
But based on this verse,
do you think God would answer our prayer

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:52.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we asked him for a million dollars?

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Probably not.

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No matter what we ask . . .”

00:00:57.745 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“. . . according to his will . . .”

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can pray for anything
in harmony with God’s will.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about asking him
to give us wisdom to do what’s right?

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:08.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:10.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can ask him for that.

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, that’s certainly in harmony
with God’s will, right?

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:18.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next time we talk,
let’s discuss how God answers our prayers.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like that.
