As recorded at Luke 6:38,

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.241 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus encouraged his followers

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “practice giving.”

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your generous gifts of time, energy,

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and financial resources have shown

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you take this encouragement to heart.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have made a practice of giving
by continuing to look for ways

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can support one another,
both locally and globally.

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:32.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
has asked me to convey to you

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:36.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
their sincere appreciation
for your practice of giving.

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:41.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your kindness contributes
to the spirit that Jesus goes on to describe

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Luke 6:38:

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Practice giving,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and people will give to you.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will pour into your laps

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a fine measure, pressed down,

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:53.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“shaken together, and overflowing.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For with the measure

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:56.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you are measuring out,

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:59.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will measure out to you in return.”

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if you feel
your contributions are small,

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
never forget that every one
of your acts of generosity

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
contributes to a ripple effect

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
that goes from person to person

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
and promotes generosity
throughout our entire brotherhood.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,
notice some examples of how your donations

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:22.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
were used to help
our brothers and sisters recently

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how those same ones

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:28.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
were then motivated
to “practice giving” themselves.

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:33.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am deeply grateful

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:36.158 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the valuable help I receive

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.328 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the videos for the midweek meetings.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:41.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
These have helped me
to make simpler presentations

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:47.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many times to find just the right
scripture to answer a certain question.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:52.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have also helped me to make
better use of the videos in the ministry.

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel happy
and very cared for by Jehovah,

00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:00.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
who gives us
what we need and in the best way.

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:03.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I am also aware
that to have all these beautiful things,

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
resources are needed
—resources to continue producing videos

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
that teach us and that move us so much.

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:15.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I am determined
to continue planning my donations

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can contribute
and show my gratitude to Jehovah

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:22.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the wonderful work they do.

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have enjoyed
life at Bethel for almost 60 years,

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:31.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have lived
in various different buildings.

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:32.506 line:10% position:50% align:center
The needs of the work were

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:34.258 line:10% position:50% align:center
cared for at the previous branch

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.343 line:10% position:50% align:center
for more than 30 years.

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:38.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very nice,

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:41.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I experienced
a certain nostalgia when I left it.

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:45.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we have something
that we would never even have imagined

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:49.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we started talking about a new branch.

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is really comfortable, beautiful,

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:57.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
functional, and worthy
of the God we represent.

00:02:57.448 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, I thank our loving
heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:04.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this new branch,

00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:08.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I do not forget to thank the brothers
for their generous contributions.

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:14.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reminds me that I also
have to make my own donations,

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as every other member
of the Bethel family does.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am very happy and very grateful to Jehovah

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
for allowing me
to enjoy this beautiful provision!

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.402 line:10% position:50% align:center
I work with the Boulou translation team

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:37.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Ebolowa in the south of Cameroon.

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:42.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Voluntary donations
help to cover the basic needs of translators,

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:47.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as food, offices,
accommodations, and transportation.

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:49.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, thanks to these donations,

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:53.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are happy to have received
the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!  </i>book in Boulou.

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Publishers no longer have to translate
the material for their students.

00:03:57.674 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the book in Boulou,
they can go straight to the point,

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:04.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
which makes the study more interesting.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that my donations
help to realize such projects,

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:09.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only for the Boulou language

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:13.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for the many other languages
Jehovah’s organization translates into,

00:04:13.523 --> 00:04:15.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
is an amazing privilege!

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:25.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Taal volcano erupted,

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:28.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
it had a very big effect on me personally.

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.084 line:10% position:50% align:center
And for my part,

00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:34.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
as a wife and mother of three,

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:37.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was truly difficult for me to face.

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:45.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provided for our needs
by means of the brothers.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
This truly brought us joy and happiness.

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we never felt
that we were lacking anything.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was what encouraged us
to also help our brothers

00:04:58.402 --> 00:05:02.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving our time and energy,
especially to those in need.

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:06.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether it is a little or a lot,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah sees
that it comes from our heart,

00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:12.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will surely value it.

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:17.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is heartwarming to see
the practice of giving

00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:20.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is evident
throughout Jehovah’s organization.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:25.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your ongoing contributions,
regardless of the size or method,

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:29.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
all contribute to the growth and unity
of our brotherhood.

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:32.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
This pattern of giving is part of our worship

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:34.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brings honor to our heavenly Father.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite challenging circumstances,

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:42.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters,
and even economic uncertainty,

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:46.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have been overwhelmingly generous.

00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:51.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah certainly takes note
of your generous spirit, and we do as well.

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:56.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our prayer that Jehovah continues
to bless your practice of giving

00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:58.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
with “a fine measure, pressed down,

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
shaken together, and overflowing.”

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:06.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for all you have done
and continue to do!
