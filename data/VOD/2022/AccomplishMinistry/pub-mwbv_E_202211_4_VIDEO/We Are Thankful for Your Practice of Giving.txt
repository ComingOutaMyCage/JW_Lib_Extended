00:00:06 As recorded at Luke 6:38,
00:00:09 Jesus encouraged his followers
00:00:12 to “practice giving.”
00:00:14 Your generous gifts of time, energy,
00:00:17 and financial resources have shown
00:00:19 that you take this encouragement to heart.
00:00:22 You have made a practice of giving by continuing to look for ways
00:00:25 you can support one another, both locally and globally.
00:00:30 The Governing Body has asked me to convey to you
00:00:32 their sincere appreciation for your practice of giving.
00:00:36 Your kindness contributes to the spirit that Jesus goes on to describe
00:00:41 at Luke 6:38:
00:00:43 “Practice giving,
00:00:45 “and people will give to you.
00:00:47 “They will pour into your laps
00:00:48 “a fine measure, pressed down,
00:00:50 “shaken together, and overflowing.
00:00:53 “For with the measure
00:00:55 “that you are measuring out,
00:00:56 they will measure out to you in return.”
00:00:59 Even if you feel your contributions are small,
00:01:03 never forget that every one of your acts of generosity
00:01:06 contributes to a ripple effect
00:01:09 that goes from person to person
00:01:11 and promotes generosity throughout our entire brotherhood.
00:01:15 In the following video, notice some examples of how your donations
00:01:19 were used to help our brothers and sisters recently
00:01:22 and how those same ones
00:01:24 were then motivated to “practice giving” themselves.
00:01:31 I am deeply grateful
00:01:33 for the valuable help I receive
00:01:36 from the videos for the midweek meetings.
00:01:39 These have helped me to make simpler presentations
00:01:41 and many times to find just the right scripture to answer a certain question.
00:01:48 They have also helped me to make better use of the videos in the ministry.
00:01:53 I feel happy and very cared for by Jehovah,
00:01:56 who gives us what we need and in the best way.
00:02:00 And I am also aware that to have all these beautiful things,
00:02:03 resources are needed —resources to continue producing videos
00:02:08 that teach us and that move us so much.
00:02:11 So I am determined to continue planning my donations
00:02:15 so that I can contribute and show my gratitude to Jehovah
00:02:20 for the wonderful work they do.
00:02:24 I have enjoyed life at Bethel for almost 60 years,
00:02:28 and I have lived in various different buildings.
00:02:31 The needs of the work were
00:02:32 cared for at the previous branch
00:02:34 for more than 30 years.
00:02:36 It was very nice,
00:02:38 and I experienced a certain nostalgia when I left it.
00:02:41 Now we have something that we would never even have imagined
00:02:45 when we started talking about a new branch.
00:02:49 It is really comfortable, beautiful,
00:02:52 functional, and worthy of the God we represent.
00:02:57 Today, I thank our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah,
00:03:01 for this new branch,
00:03:04 and I do not forget to thank the brothers for their generous contributions.
00:03:10 This reminds me that I also have to make my own donations,
00:03:14 just as every other member of the Bethel family does.
00:03:17 I am very happy and very grateful to Jehovah
00:03:21 for allowing me to enjoy this beautiful provision!
00:03:33 I work with the Boulou translation team
00:03:35 in Ebolowa in the south of Cameroon.
00:03:37 Voluntary donations help to cover the basic needs of translators,
00:03:42 such as food, offices, accommodations, and transportation.
00:03:47 Also, thanks to these donations,
00:03:49 we are happy to have received the Enjoy Life Forever!  book in Boulou.
00:03:53 Publishers no longer have to translate the material for their students.
00:03:57 With the book in Boulou, they can go straight to the point,
00:04:00 which makes the study more interesting.
00:04:04 Knowing that my donations help to realize such projects,
00:04:07 not only for the Boulou language
00:04:09 but also for the many other languages Jehovah’s organization translates into,
00:04:13 is an amazing privilege!
00:04:23 When the Taal volcano erupted,
00:04:25 it had a very big effect on me personally.
00:04:30 And for my part,
00:04:32 as a wife and mother of three,
00:04:34 it was truly difficult for me to face.
00:04:41 Jehovah provided for our needs by means of the brothers.
00:04:46 This truly brought us joy and happiness.
00:04:50 So we never felt that we were lacking anything.
00:04:53 That was what encouraged us to also help our brothers
00:04:58 by giving our time and energy, especially to those in need.
00:05:04 Whether it is a little or a lot,
00:05:06 when Jehovah sees that it comes from our heart,
00:05:10 he will surely value it.
00:05:14 It is heartwarming to see the practice of giving
00:05:17 that is evident throughout Jehovah’s organization.
00:05:20 Your ongoing contributions, regardless of the size or method,
00:05:25 all contribute to the growth and unity of our brotherhood.
00:05:29 This pattern of giving is part of our worship
00:05:32 and brings honor to our heavenly Father.
00:05:34 Despite challenging circumstances,
00:05:36 such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:05:39 natural disasters, and even economic uncertainty,
00:05:42 you have been overwhelmingly generous.
00:05:46 Jehovah certainly takes note of your generous spirit, and we do as well.
00:05:52 It is our prayer that Jehovah continues to bless your practice of giving
00:05:56 with “a fine measure, pressed down,
00:05:58 shaken together, and overflowing.”
00:06:02 Thank you for all you have done and continue to do!
