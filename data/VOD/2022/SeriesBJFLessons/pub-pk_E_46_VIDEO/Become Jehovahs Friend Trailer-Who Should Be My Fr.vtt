For those of you who participated
in the science club this weekend,

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:14.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be having another camping trip!

Hey, Sophia!

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:18.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need you in our club.

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re good at science!

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have another trip coming up.

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:25.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sounded like a lot of fun.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:30.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants you and me to have friends.

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:33.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question you need to ask yourself is,

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:35.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Who should be my friend?’

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can you know
if someone should be your friend?

00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:52.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, please help me find a good friend,

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who loves you.
