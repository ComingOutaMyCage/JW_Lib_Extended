00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:05.736 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to 1 Chronicles.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the original Hebrew canon,

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:12.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 and 2 Chronicles
were apparently one volume,

00:00:12.577 --> 00:00:15.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was later divided for convenience.

00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:20.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
The writer of the entire volume
was evidently Ezra,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
a priest and expert copyist of the Law.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:27.470 line:10% position:50% align:center
He completed the work about 460 B.C.E.

00:00:28.638 --> 00:00:30.640 line:10% position:50% align:center
Aside from the genealogies,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.685 line:10% position:50% align:center
which go back to Adam,

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.523 line:10% position:50% align:center
1 Chronicles covers a period of 40 years,

00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:40.986 line:10% position:50% align:center
from about 1077 to 1037 B.C.E.

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:45.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book can be divided into two sections.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first 9 chapters deal largely
with genealogies;

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:53.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
the other 20 cover events

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the death of King Saul

00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:58.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the end of David’s reign.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 2 to 4

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:06.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
list the descendants of Judah and David,

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the royal line.

00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:13.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapter 6 lists the descendants of Levi,

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:15.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
which includes the priestly line of Aaron.

00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:20.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:23.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
The genealogies and history of 1 Chronicles

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
were important for the outworking

00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:27.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s purpose.

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:29.628 line:10% position:50% align:center
The returning exiles needed them

00:01:29.628 --> 00:01:32.506 line:10% position:50% align:center
so that Israel would be a theocratic nation

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.759 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a priesthood.

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.804 line:10% position:50% align:center
The early Christian writers Matthew and Luke

00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:39.807 line:10% position:50% align:center
used the genealogies to show

00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:42.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
that Jesus was the Son of David

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:44.479 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a legal right to the throne.

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:50.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 11,

00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:53.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
David is made king over all Israel.

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:56.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon thereafter,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
David captures the stronghold of Zion.

00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:02.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapters 15 and 16,

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ark of the covenant
is taken to the City of David

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:08.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the shoulders of the Kohathite Levites.

00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:11.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 17,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
David expresses his desire
to build a temple for Jehovah.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jehovah tells David through Nathan

00:02:20.397 --> 00:02:23.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
that one of the king’s sons
will build the temple.

00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:25.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:29.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah reassures his beloved David

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
by promising to give him a lasting house,

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:34.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
or royal dynasty.

00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:37.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 18 to 20

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:40.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
record David’s victories over enemy nations,

00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:44.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the Ammonites, Edomites,

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:47.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moabites, Philistines, and Syrians.

00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:50.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 21,

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:53.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
David is incited to number Israel.

00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:59.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
David’s sin greatly displeases Jehovah

00:02:59.152 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and costs the lives of 70,000 Israelites.

00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:06.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapters 22 to 28,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
David makes extensive preparations
for the future temple.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 22,

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:18.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
he instructs his son Solomon
to build Jehovah’s house.

00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:21.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
David contributes toward the project

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:24.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
100,000 talents of gold,

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:26.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
1,000,000 talents of silver,

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an immeasurable amount

00:03:28.813 --> 00:03:30.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
of copper and iron.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:33.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 25,

00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:35.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
David separates some of the sons

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Levites Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:42.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve as temple musicians and singers.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 28,

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:48.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
David assembles the princes of Israel
in Jerusalem

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:50.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and commands them:

00:03:50.923 --> 00:03:53.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Carefully observe and search

00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:55.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all the commandments
of Jehovah your God.”

00:03:57.264 --> 00:04:01.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he gives Solomon
the architectural plans for the temple,

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:04.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
which David received by divine inspiration.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 29,

00:04:07.484 --> 00:04:09.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon becomes king

00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:13.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and David dies after reigning for 40 years.

00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:17.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read 1 Chronicles,

00:04:17.746 --> 00:04:20.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
note how meticulously Ezra recorded

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:22.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel’s history,

00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:24.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
read how Jehovah blessed

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
his beloved servant David,

00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:30.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how the genealogies help to establish

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:33.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah,

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:35.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
the future King of God’s Kingdom.
