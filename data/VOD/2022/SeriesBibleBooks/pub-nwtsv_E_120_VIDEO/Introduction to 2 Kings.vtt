00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:04.984 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to 2 Kings.

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:08.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Attributed to Jeremiah,

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Kings begins where 1 Kings ends.

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:16.328 line:10% position:50% align:center
The account spans some 340 years,

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:20.124 line:10% position:50% align:center
from about 920 to 580 B.C.E.,

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.126 line:10% position:50% align:center
when the writing was completed.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book describes the spiritual decline

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
of both Israel and Judah

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:30.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
until both kingdoms were taken into exile.

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 2,

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Elijah
is taken up in a windstorm.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
His attendant, Elisha, succeeds him.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapters 4 and 5,

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha resurrects the son
of a Shunammite woman.

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:53.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha also miraculously feeds 100 people

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 20 loaves of bread and a bag of grain,

00:00:57.077 --> 00:01:00.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he heals
Syrian army chief Naaman of leprosy.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 6,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
a military force from Syria
is searching for Elisha.

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:08.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
They surround Dothan,

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he and his attendant are staying.

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:15.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah opens the eyes
of the fearful attendant

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he sees “war chariots
of fire all around Elisha.”

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 9,
Jehu is anointed as king of Israel.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is commanded
to strike down the house of Ahab,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
which includes Ahab’s widow, Jezebel.

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 11, Ahab’s daughter Athaliah

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:39.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
usurps the throne in Judah

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:43.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and attempts to eliminate the royal line.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, High Priest Jehoiada and his wife

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
rescue the infant Jehoash.

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:52.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehoash is seven years old,

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:56.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is made king and Athaliah is put to death.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:02.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 15,
Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
invades the northern kingdom
and takes many into exile.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 17,

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:12.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Assyrian King Shalmaneser
also invades Israel

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:15.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and takes the remaining people away captive.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:20.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:23.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
In an effort to discourage future uprisings,

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:27.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
these Assyrian kings
removed captives from conquered lands

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:30.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and replaced them with foreigners.

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:34.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those transplanted into Samaria
became known as Samaritans.

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:41.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 18,
Hezekiah becomes king of Judah.

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:44.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does what is right in God’s eyes.

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:48.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Hezekiah’s 14th year,

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:50.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Assyrian King Sennacherib

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:53.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
invades Judah and threatens Jerusalem.

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 19, Jehovah reveals
to the prophet Isaiah

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
that He will defend the city.

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah then sends
God’s message to Hezekiah.

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:07.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
On that very night,

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s angel strikes down

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:12.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
185,000 men in the Assyrian camp.

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:15.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 21,

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:19.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah’s 12-year-old son,
Manasseh, becomes king.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
He disobeys Jehovah “on a grand scale,”

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:26.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
even making “his own son
pass through the fire.”

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:32.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 22, after the death
of Manasseh and his son Amon,

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:35.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
eight-year-old Josiah becomes king.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does what is right in God’s eyes.

00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:42.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last three chapters of 2 Kings

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
discuss the final four kings of Judah

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:47.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehoahaz, Johoiakim,

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
All disobey Jehovah.

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 24,

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
during Jehoiachin’s three-month reign,

00:03:57.132 --> 00:04:01.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
besieges Jerusalem.

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:05.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoiachin surrenders and is taken to Babylon

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his princes,
court officials, and servants.

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:13.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 25, during Zedekiah’s reign,

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:17.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar attacks
Jerusalem the second time.

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:21.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Babylonians burn down the temple,

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:23.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
pull down the city walls,

00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:27.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take Zedekiah to Babylon
with the surviving Jews.

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:30.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gedaliah is appointed governor

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:33.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the few lowly ones who remain in Judah.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, he is assassinated,
and the people flee to Egypt.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read 2 Kings,

00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:49.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
note the hardships
that bad rulers caused their subjects,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
see how Jehovah
blessed the kings who loved him,

00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:57.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
and read how he preserved
the family line of David,

00:04:57.234 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
which produced the One
who later became King of God’s Kingdom.
