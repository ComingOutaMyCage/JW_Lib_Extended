00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:03.019 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, today’s text comments mention

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:04.688 line:10% position:50% align:center
the effect that prejudice

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:06.790 line:10% position:50% align:center
had on Jesus’ disciples.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.059 line:10% position:50% align:center
And as we think about that today

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.061 line:10% position:50% align:center
and how we are part of an organization

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:12.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
that is much more diverse

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:14.631 line:10% position:50% align:center
than in the first century,

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:16.633 line:10% position:50% align:center
it raises the question,

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does prejudice still have an impact
on God’s people today?

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very thankful
that we love and serve a God

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
who does not tolerate prejudice.

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:30.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible states that quite plainly.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Acts,

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we note the words
of the apostle Peter in Acts chapter 10.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 34, it says:

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:46.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this Peter began to speak, and he said:

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now I truly understand

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:51.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that God is not partial,

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but in every nation

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the man who fears him and does what is right

00:00:57.407 --> 00:00:59.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
is acceptable to him.’”

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you look at the study note,

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
it mentions that the Greek phrase
for “is not partial”

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally means “is not one who takes faces.”

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:14.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that perfectly
describes Jehovah, doesn’t it?

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:19.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not favor one face, one individual,

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
over another
because of their race, nationality,

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:26.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
social standing,
or any other external factors.

00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:29.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s how
you and I strive to be as well.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:36.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we must acknowledge
that it is a challenge to be impartial,

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
largely because in today’s world

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are surrounded by prejudice.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to answer that question:

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:46.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does prejudice have an impact
on God’s people today?

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
—indeed, it does.

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may be victims of it,

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:53.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we ourselves might hold some prejudice.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:58.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, <i>The Watchtower</i>  back in 2013

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
made this comment, it said:

00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:03.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If we are honest with ourselves,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have to admit that deep down

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:11.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we all harbor varying degrees of prejudice

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
in one form or another.”

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if this is something
that is a human tendency

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:22.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re all plagued with it,
at least to some degree,

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:24.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
then how do we overcome it?

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:28.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it might be helpful
to start with the word itself.

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:31.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Sister Leithiser mentioned,
the dictionary defines prejudice

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:34.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “a preconceived opinion

00:02:34.838 --> 00:02:39.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is not based
on reason or actual experience.”

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
A preconceived opinion

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:48.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to do with how we think and how we feel

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:52.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
—thoughts that likely
have been shaped by our personal experiences,

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
our upbringing, and our environment.

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:58.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe when we think of prejudice,

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:02.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps our minds
go to or we focus on racial prejudice

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hatred or animosity toward someone.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked a little bit about that last week.

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
But <i>The Watchtower</i>
also mentioned that prejudices

00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:16.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also be formed against
another person because of their weight,

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:20.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
gender, language, social status,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
religion, or virtually
any perceived difference.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if prejudice starts with our personality

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:32.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
or our personal preconceived opinions,

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the way to overcome it

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to start by elevating our minds

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:41.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
to God’s way of thinking.

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:45.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, if we go back to the Bible,
this time to 1 Samuel chapter 16,

00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:52.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how Jehovah
brings this to light—1 Samuel chapter 16.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:56.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s recall what happens
when Samuel goes to the house of Jesse

00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
to appoint one of his sons as king.

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:02.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 6 says:

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:05.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they came in and he saw Eliab, he said:

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:09.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Surely here before Jehovah
stands his anointed one.’

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Jehovah said to Samuel:

00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:17.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not pay attention
to his appearance and how tall he is,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
for I have rejected him.’”

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:24.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we stop there for a moment,
did you notice what Samuel did?

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this particular instance,

00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:29.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was as that Greek phrase denoted,

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a taker of faces,” wasn’t he?

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:35.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
He looked at Eliab;
he saw how tall and how handsome he looked.

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Surely, this must be Jehovah’s choice.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
But note how the verse continues;
note the teaching point:

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:46.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For the way man
sees is not the way God sees,

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:50.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because mere man
sees what appears to the eyes,

00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:53.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”

00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:57.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what matters to Jehovah

00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what’s in our heart,
what we are on the inside.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s looking
for those qualities in each of us

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:06.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reflect his impartiality.

00:05:07.457 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how is this of benefit to us, 
since you and I cannot read hearts?

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back to the study note.

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:17.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rest of the study note
for Acts 10:34 gives us the answer,

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:20.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it says:

00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:22.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Imitating God’s impartiality means,

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not making surface judgments,

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
but paying attention
to the character and qualities of others.”

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:36.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, perhaps one way we can illustrate this
is with the example of a geode.

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:38.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, look at this picture.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:40.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
On its outside surface,

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:44.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
a geode looks pretty ordinary and nondescript

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:48.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no different than any big rock
or stone you’d find outside.

00:05:48.364 --> 00:05:50.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you break it open,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
ah, quite a different story.

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you look inside,

00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see these beautiful
sparkling crystals of varying colors

00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:04.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are just quite beautiful
and really radiant to the eye.

00:06:04.347 --> 00:06:06.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s our point?

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:10.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we make surface judgments

00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:14.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
or preconceived opinions about our brothers,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
often aren’t we looking at them
like the outside of that geode?

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:21.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
All that we see is just the external surface.

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:26.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it so true
that perhaps if someone is shy,

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
quiet, or reserved,

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s so easy to label them, isn’t it?

00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
We sized them up,
and we quickly come to the conclusion:

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:35.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ah, you know what, there’s not much there.

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:38.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really don’t have much to offer.”

00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:42.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or it could be that the person is very
talkative, loud, extroverted—same thing.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:44.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
We label them and form an opinion.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could it be in those
particular instances that we have become

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:50.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a taker of faces”?

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve made a judgment
purely based on personal opinion

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:56.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what we feel is acceptable.

00:06:58.034 --> 00:07:01.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to imitate Jehovah’s way of thinking,

00:07:01.704 --> 00:07:04.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to go beyond the surface;

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:09.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to focus on the character
and the qualities of our brothers,

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:13.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with some people that may take time.

00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:16.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, with the geode, one expert stated:

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There are many
different ways to open a geode.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But no matter how you do it,

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:27.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
the key is patience, patience, patience.”

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:31.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it true
that it’s the same with our brothers?

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:34.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes time and patience
to get to know them,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
time and patience
to understand the way that they think,

00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:41.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show personal interest
by asking questions,

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:45.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work with them in the ministry,
and to consider their suggestions.

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:49.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we do, well, we’re rewarded.

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:52.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
We begin to see the crystals;

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:56.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
we begin to see their inner beauty inside;

00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
we discover true depth
in our brothers and sisters,

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:01.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hopefully they do in us as well.

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:04.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, going back to Jesus’ disciples,

00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:07.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
while the Bible candidly details

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
a number of accounts
showing their human traits

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their prejudicial feelings at times,

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:16.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
it also highlights
how they overcame those feelings.

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:21.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just look at how much we read and meditate
on the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:26.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how much those verses
and books emphasize love,

00:08:26.489 --> 00:08:28.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
opening our hearts, loving our brothers,

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:32.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting along with one another,
and widening out.

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:36.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples did not allow
any deep-rooted feelings

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:41.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
or things from their upbringing
or their environment to control them.

00:08:42.238 --> 00:08:45.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you and I can be the same.

00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:50.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it all starts
with an honest self-examination:

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:54.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Can I identify any traces
of prejudice within me?’

00:08:55.885 --> 00:09:00.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we can, well,
it all starts with our thinking

00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:05.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
—elevating our thinking
to Jehovah’s way of thinking.

00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:09.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s avoid surface judgments,
being “a taker of faces.”

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:11.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take the time
to get to know our brothers

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciate their character and qualities

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their inner beauty.

00:09:16.939 --> 00:09:20.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus told his disciples at Matthew 23:8:

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:22.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All of you are brothers.”

00:09:22.778 --> 00:09:25.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what made them brothers?

00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:30.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 12:50, Jesus said:
“For whoever does the will of my Father . . . ,

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:33.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that one is my brother

00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:35.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sister and mother.”

00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:38.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a nice reminder, isn’t it?

00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are all part of a large spiritual family

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:44.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
united by our faith and love for God.

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:46.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we see each other that way,

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us to remain humble

00:09:49.305 --> 00:09:53.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and recognize that we have no reason
to elevate ourselves above others.

00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:58.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we’re going to be filled
with so much love and appreciation

00:09:58.247 --> 00:10:00.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be part of this organization

00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:04.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we imitate our impartial God
and Father, Jehovah.
