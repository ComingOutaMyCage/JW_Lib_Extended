00:00:01 Well, today’s text comments mention
00:00:03 the effect that prejudice
00:00:04 had on Jesus’ disciples.
00:00:06 And as we think about that today
00:00:09 and how we are part of an organization
00:00:11 that is much more diverse
00:00:12 than in the first century,
00:00:14 it raises the question,
00:00:16 Does prejudice still have an impact on God’s people today?
00:00:22 We’re very thankful that we love and serve a God
00:00:25 who does not tolerate prejudice.
00:00:28 The Bible states that quite plainly.
00:00:30 Turn with me, please, to the book of Acts,
00:00:34 and we note the words of the apostle Peter in Acts chapter 10.
00:00:40 In verse 34, it says:
00:00:42 “At this Peter began to speak, and he said:
00:00:46 “‘Now I truly understand
00:00:48 “‘that God is not partial,
00:00:51 “‘but in every nation
00:00:54 “‘the man who fears him and does what is right
00:00:57 is acceptable to him.’”
00:00:59 Now, if you look at the study note,
00:01:01 it mentions that the Greek phrase for “is not partial”
00:01:06 literally means “is not one who takes faces.”
00:01:11 And that perfectly describes Jehovah, doesn’t it?
00:01:14 He does not favor one face, one individual,
00:01:19 over another because of their race, nationality,
00:01:23 social standing, or any other external factors.
00:01:26 And that’s how you and I strive to be as well.
00:01:31 However, we must acknowledge that it is a challenge to be impartial,
00:01:36 largely because in today’s world
00:01:38 we are surrounded by prejudice.
00:01:41 So to answer that question:
00:01:43 Does prejudice have an impact on God’s people today?
00:01:46 —indeed, it does.
00:01:48 We may be victims of it,
00:01:50 or we ourselves might hold some prejudice.
00:01:55 Interestingly, The Watchtower  back in 2013
00:01:58 made this comment, it said:
00:02:01 “If we are honest with ourselves,
00:02:03 “we have to admit that deep down
00:02:06 “we all harbor varying degrees of prejudice
00:02:11 in one form or another.”
00:02:14 So if this is something that is a human tendency
00:02:18 and we’re all plagued with it, at least to some degree,
00:02:22 then how do we overcome it?
00:02:25 Well, it might be helpful to start with the word itself.
00:02:28 As Sister Leithiser mentioned, the dictionary defines prejudice
00:02:31 as “a preconceived opinion
00:02:34 that is not based on reason or actual experience.”
00:02:40 A preconceived opinion
00:02:43 has to do with how we think and how we feel
00:02:48 —thoughts that likely have been shaped by our personal experiences,
00:02:52 our upbringing, and our environment.
00:02:56 Now, maybe when we think of prejudice,
00:02:58 perhaps our minds go to or we focus on racial prejudice
00:03:02 —hatred or animosity toward someone.
00:03:05 We talked a little bit about that last week.
00:03:08 But The Watchtower also mentioned that prejudices
00:03:11 can also be formed against another person because of their weight,
00:03:16 gender, language, social status,
00:03:20 religion, or virtually any perceived difference.
00:03:25 So if prejudice starts with our personality
00:03:29 or our personal preconceived opinions,
00:03:32 then the way to overcome it
00:03:35 has to start by elevating our minds
00:03:38 to God’s way of thinking.
00:03:41 Again, if we go back to the Bible, this time to 1 Samuel chapter 16,
00:03:47 notice how Jehovah brings this to light—1 Samuel chapter 16.
00:03:52 And let’s recall what happens when Samuel goes to the house of Jesse
00:03:56 to appoint one of his sons as king.
00:04:00 Verse 6 says:
00:04:02 “As they came in and he saw Eliab, he said:
00:04:05 “‘Surely here before Jehovah stands his anointed one.’
00:04:10 “But Jehovah said to Samuel:
00:04:13 “‘Do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is,
00:04:17 for I have rejected him.’”
00:04:20 Now, if we stop there for a moment, did you notice what Samuel did?
00:04:24 In this particular instance,
00:04:26 he was as that Greek phrase denoted,
00:04:29 “a taker of faces,” wasn’t he?
00:04:32 He looked at Eliab; he saw how tall and how handsome he looked.
00:04:35 Surely, this must be Jehovah’s choice.
00:04:38 But note how the verse continues; note the teaching point:
00:04:42 “‘For the way man sees is not the way God sees,
00:04:46 “‘because mere man sees what appears to the eyes,
00:04:50 but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”
00:04:55 That’s what matters to Jehovah
00:04:57 —what’s in our heart, what we are on the inside.
00:05:00 And he’s looking for those qualities in each of us
00:05:03 that reflect his impartiality.
00:05:07 Now, how is this of benefit to us,  since you and I cannot read hearts?
00:05:12 Well, let’s go back to the study note.
00:05:14 The rest of the study note for Acts 10:34 gives us the answer,
00:05:17 because it says:
00:05:20 “Imitating God’s impartiality means,
00:05:22 “not making surface judgments,
00:05:26 but paying attention to the character and qualities of others.”
00:05:32 Now, perhaps one way we can illustrate this is with the example of a geode.
00:05:36 Now, look at this picture.
00:05:38 On its outside surface,
00:05:40 a geode looks pretty ordinary and nondescript
00:05:44 —no different than any big rock or stone you’d find outside.
00:05:48 But if you break it open,
00:05:50 ah, quite a different story.
00:05:53 Now, when you look inside,
00:05:55 you see these beautiful sparkling crystals of varying colors
00:05:59 that are just quite beautiful and really radiant to the eye.
00:06:04 Well, what’s our point?
00:06:07 When we make surface judgments
00:06:10 or preconceived opinions about our brothers,
00:06:14 often aren’t we looking at them like the outside of that geode?
00:06:18 All that we see is just the external surface.
00:06:22 And isn’t it so true that perhaps if someone is shy,
00:06:26 quiet, or reserved,
00:06:28 it’s so easy to label them, isn’t it?
00:06:30 We sized them up, and we quickly come to the conclusion:
00:06:33 “Ah, you know what, there’s not much there.
00:06:35 They really don’t have much to offer.”
00:06:38 Or it could be that the person is very talkative, loud, extroverted—same thing.
00:06:42 We label them and form an opinion.
00:06:44 Could it be in those particular instances that we have become
00:06:48 “a taker of faces”?
00:06:50 We’ve made a judgment purely based on personal opinion
00:06:54 or what we feel is acceptable.
00:06:58 But to imitate Jehovah’s way of thinking,
00:07:01 we have to go beyond the surface;
00:07:04 we have to focus on the character and the qualities of our brothers,
00:07:09 and with some people that may take time.
00:07:13 You know, with the geode, one expert stated:
00:07:16 “There are many different ways to open a geode.
00:07:19 “But no matter how you do it,
00:07:22 the key is patience, patience, patience.”
00:07:28 And isn’t it true that it’s the same with our brothers?
00:07:31 It takes time and patience to get to know them,
00:07:34 time and patience to understand the way that they think,
00:07:38 to show personal interest by asking questions,
00:07:41 to work with them in the ministry, and to consider their suggestions.
00:07:45 But when we do, well, we’re rewarded.
00:07:49 We begin to see the crystals;
00:07:52 we begin to see their inner beauty inside;
00:07:56 we discover true depth in our brothers and sisters,
00:07:59 and hopefully they do in us as well.
00:08:02 Now, going back to Jesus’ disciples,
00:08:04 while the Bible candidly details
00:08:07 a number of accounts showing their human traits
00:08:10 and their prejudicial feelings at times,
00:08:12 it also highlights how they overcame those feelings.
00:08:16 Just look at how much we read and meditate on the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:08:21 and how much those verses and books emphasize love,
00:08:26 opening our hearts, loving our brothers,
00:08:28 getting along with one another, and widening out.
00:08:32 The disciples did not allow any deep-rooted feelings
00:08:36 or things from their upbringing or their environment to control them.
00:08:42 And you and I can be the same.
00:08:45 But it all starts with an honest self-examination:
00:08:50 ‘Can I identify any traces of prejudice within me?’
00:08:55 And if we can, well, it all starts with our thinking
00:09:00 —elevating our thinking to Jehovah’s way of thinking.
00:09:05 Let’s avoid surface judgments, being “a taker of faces.”
00:09:09 Let’s take the time to get to know our brothers
00:09:11 and appreciate their character and qualities
00:09:14 —their inner beauty.
00:09:16 Jesus told his disciples at Matthew 23:8:
00:09:20 “All of you are brothers.”
00:09:22 And what made them brothers?
00:09:25 At Matthew 12:50, Jesus said: “For whoever does the will of my Father . . . ,
00:09:30 “that one is my brother
00:09:33 and sister and mother.”
00:09:35 It’s a nice reminder, isn’t it?
00:09:38 We are all part of a large spiritual family
00:09:41 united by our faith and love for God.
00:09:44 And if we see each other that way,
00:09:46 that will help us to remain humble
00:09:49 and recognize that we have no reason to elevate ourselves above others.
00:09:53 Instead, we’re going to be filled with so much love and appreciation
00:09:58 to be part of this organization
00:10:00 as we imitate our impartial God and Father, Jehovah.
