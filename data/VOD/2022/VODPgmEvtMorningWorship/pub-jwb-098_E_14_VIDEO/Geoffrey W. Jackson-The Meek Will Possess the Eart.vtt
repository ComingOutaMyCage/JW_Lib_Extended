WEBVTT

00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10% position:50% align:center
“The meek will possess the earth.”

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:06.423 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re all familiar

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:07.691 line:10% position:50% align:center
with those words, aren’t we,

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:10.360 line:10% position:50% align:center
from Psalm 37:11?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.362 line:10% position:50% align:center
No doubt, we’ve used them in the ministry

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:15.198 line:10% position:50% align:center
to help others have a hope for the future.

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:20.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does it really mean
for someone to be meek?

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:24.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we get help
with regard to the definition

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:27.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we turn to the words of our Lord Jesus,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Matthew 5:5.

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:35.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Matthew 5:5,

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:39.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here Jesus is recorded as saying:

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:44.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the mild-tempered,
since they will inherit the earth.”

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:48.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll notice
there’s a slightly different expression

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:51.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus used here
as recorded in Greek

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is being mild-tempered.

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:58.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at the study note,
we’ll notice a very interesting comment.

00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:01.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “The Greek term

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not imply cowardice or weakness.

00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:06.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the <i>Septuagint,</i>
the word was used

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:09.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as an equivalent for a Hebrew word

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:12.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can be translated ‘meek’ or ‘humble.’”

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:17.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we see that
because even though Jesus spoke in Hebrew

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was recorded in Greek,

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:24.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
this translation of the word “mild-tempered”
is there in the text.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:28.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
And “mild-tempered” helps us a little
to understand the word “meek.”

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:31.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mild-tempered means not hot-tempered

00:01:31.808 --> 00:01:34.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
and doesn’t mean
saying someone is cold either.

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:37.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just means
that they’re balanced

00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:40.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
with how they handle
their reaction to things.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Insight</i>  volume makes the comment

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
that being meek or mild-tempered

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘enables a person
to endure injury with patience,

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:53.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘without irritation, without resentment,

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
or vindictive retaliation.’

00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:00.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s what’s involved with being meek.

00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>
 from which the comments are taken

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us that no one in this sinful world

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
is born with meekness.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s something that we need to develop,

00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:16.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s something
that we need to keep on working on.

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:20.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, our text refers to Moses.

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:22.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you notice there in the Scripture

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it doesn’t just say:
“Moses was meek.”

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t just say:

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moses was the meekest man.”

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:34.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it say?

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:39.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
He “was by far the meekest” man.

00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:41.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s very interesting.

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:45.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d all like to have that said of us,
wouldn’t we?

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we look at what happened

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:51.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
just toward the end
of the 40 years in the wilderness,

00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:55.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see that Moses reacted badly.

00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:58.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what was it that caused him to do so?

00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:01.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was because of his reaction

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:05.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
to persons who frustrated him, irritated him,

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:09.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who, it seemed,
always rejected the word of Jehovah.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the lesson in this for us today?

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:16.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our meekness too

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be challenged in a similar way.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:24.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be the frustrations
of dealing with others.

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:27.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or even in these difficult times
in which we’re living now

00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
in seeing shortages of food and medicine.

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:35.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps seeing persons
with their shopping trolleys

00:03:35.398 --> 00:03:38.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
full of items that we know
they shouldn’t have got

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so many things—
but here they are,

00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:45.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting away with all this produce,
and so on.

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:48.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet here we are,
we don’t have enough.

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that can be a test of meekness.

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:53.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking at television programs

00:03:53.683 --> 00:03:56.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing what the world leaders are saying,

00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:58.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
what politicians are arguing about,

00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:01.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also be a test of meekness.

00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:05.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing prejudice and unfairness in our lives,

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
all these things

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:11.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be just like the situation with Moses.

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:14.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be tested with regard to our meekness.

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:17.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, here’s the question:

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:21.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will help us to remain meek?

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will help us to develop meekness?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the first thing we’d like to mention
is a very important thing,

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:33.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is for us to strengthen
our trust in Jehovah

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to put our hope in him.

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:40.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s go back to the words
that we mentioned in the beginning

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:43.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
taken from Psalm 37.

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the context,

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:48.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking of what we just discussed

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:51.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the tests that we may face now

00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:53.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even in the future

00:04:53.843 --> 00:04:56.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might test our meekness.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in Psalm 37,

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s read verses 7-11:

00:05:03.753 --> 00:05:06.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep silent before Jehovah

00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wait expectantly for him.”

00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:14.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the key to maintaining meekness?

00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:17.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, waiting on Jehovah.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he goes on to say:
“Do not be upset by the man

00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:24.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who succeeds in carrying out his schemes.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:29.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let go of anger and abandon rage;

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:33.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do not become upset and turn to doing evil.

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For evil men will be done away with,

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but those hoping in Jehovah

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will possess the earth.

00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:47.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just a little while longer,
and the wicked will be no more;

00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:51.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will look at where they were,
and they will not be there.

00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:54.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the meek will possess the earth,

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:58.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will find exquisite delight

00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:00.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the abundance of peace.”

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:04.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we read these words,

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:06.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly at this time
in which we’re living now,

00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:10.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t they take on deeper meaning for us?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, for us to show meekness,

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:17.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to trust fully in Jehovah, our God.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to leave things to him.

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some things we know will only be corrected

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:26.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
by what Jehovah does in the near future.

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:30.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with that in mind,
let’s look at the book of Romans.

00:06:30.373 --> 00:06:34.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we turn there together
to Romans chapter 12,

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
we notice that a similar thought

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the one described in Psalm 37

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
is also here in Romans chapter 12,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read together verses 17-19:

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return evil for evil to no one.

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take into consideration what is fine

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the viewpoint of all men.

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:05.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“be peaceable with all men.

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:12.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but yield place to the wrath;

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:20.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine;

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will repay,’ says Jehovah.”

00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:30.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when it says “yield place to the wrath,”
what does that mean?

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know that <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:35.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
has helped us to see
that that’s Jehovah’s wrath.

00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:39.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, it’s his right

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:44.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rectify
all these bad things that are happening.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
So rather than presumptuously trying
to jump in and right the wrong

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:52.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and try to react in a negative way

00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:55.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all these bad things
that are happening around us,

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
some things we realize
we have to leave to Jehovah

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allow him to correct the situation.

00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:05.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the first point:

00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:09.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strengthen our trust in Jehovah.

00:08:09.272 --> 00:08:12.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, make sure our hope is in him.

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:15.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second point is

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:19.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need
to actively develop humility.

00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:21.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, later, if you check the book

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Zephaniah 2:3,

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:28.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
it mentions there
that we need to “seek meekness,”

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it mentions “meek ones of the earth.”

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:33.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the footnote to that verse

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:38.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentions “humility,” the “humble ones.”

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:42.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, then,
humility is also connected

00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:46.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
with having a mild temper
and being meek.

00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:47.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:51.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, humility means we respect others.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of course, included in that
is our respect of Jehovah,

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowing him to do what he needs to do

00:08:57.386 --> 00:09:00.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than us presumptuously stepping in.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:05.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our final thought
we can find in Proverbs chapter 6.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:11.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Proverbs 6:1-3,

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:16.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
here it describes a person
who is in a difficult situation.

00:09:16.072 --> 00:09:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this case, they ‘have put up
a security for [their] neighbor,’

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:23.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now it hasn’t worked out well.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:26.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does it say to do in verse 3?

00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:29.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do this, my son, and free yourself,

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:32.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you have fallen
into the hand of your neighbor.”

00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:36.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how should we react
in a situation like that?

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:40.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Go and humble yourself

00:09:40.062 --> 00:09:43.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and urgently plead with your neighbor.”

00:09:43.432 --> 00:09:46.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, interestingly,
the Hebrew expression here,

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:50.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“humble yourself,”
literally means “stamp yourself down.”

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do we see the lesson?

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:57.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re faced with a test
like Moses was faced with,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
what should we do?

00:09:59.315 --> 00:10:01.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stamp ourselves down!

00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:04.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, hold off that hot temper.

00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:08.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, have full trust and hope in Jehovah,

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:10.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in that way, we can be sure

00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:13.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will view us as a meek person.
