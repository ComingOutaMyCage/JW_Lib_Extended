00:00:01 “The meek will possess the earth.”
00:00:05 We’re all familiar
00:00:06 with those words, aren’t we,
00:00:07 from Psalm 37:11?
00:00:10 No doubt, we’ve used them in the ministry
00:00:12 to help others have a hope for the future.
00:00:16 But what does it really mean for someone to be meek?
00:00:21 Well, we get help with regard to the definition
00:00:24 if we turn to the words of our Lord Jesus,
00:00:27 as recorded at Matthew 5:5.
00:00:31 So Matthew 5:5,
00:00:35 and here Jesus is recorded as saying:
00:00:39 “Happy are the mild-tempered, since they will inherit the earth.”
00:00:45 You’ll notice there’s a slightly different expression
00:00:48 that Jesus used here as recorded in Greek
00:00:51 and that is being mild-tempered.
00:00:54 If we look at the study note, we’ll notice a very interesting comment.
00:00:58 It says: “The Greek term
00:01:01 “does not imply cowardice or weakness.
00:01:04 “In the Septuagint, the word was used
00:01:06 “as an equivalent for a Hebrew word
00:01:09 that can be translated ‘meek’ or ‘humble.’”
00:01:13 So we see that because even though Jesus spoke in Hebrew
00:01:17 but it was recorded in Greek,
00:01:19 this translation of the word “mild-tempered” is there in the text.
00:01:24 And “mild-tempered” helps us a little to understand the word “meek.”
00:01:28 Mild-tempered means not hot-tempered
00:01:31 and doesn’t mean saying someone is cold either.
00:01:34 It just means that they’re balanced
00:01:37 with how they handle their reaction to things.
00:01:40 The Insight  volume makes the comment
00:01:43 that being meek or mild-tempered
00:01:45 ‘enables a person to endure injury with patience,
00:01:50 ‘without irritation, without resentment,
00:01:53 or vindictive retaliation.’
00:01:56 So that’s what’s involved with being meek.
00:02:01 The Watchtower  from which the comments are taken
00:02:04 reminds us that no one in this sinful world
00:02:08 is born with meekness.
00:02:10 It’s something that we need to develop,
00:02:13 and it’s something that we need to keep on working on.
00:02:16 For example, our text refers to Moses.
00:02:20 Now, you notice there in the Scripture
00:02:22 that it doesn’t just say: “Moses was meek.”
00:02:26 It doesn’t just say:
00:02:29 “Moses was the meekest man.”
00:02:32 What does it say?
00:02:34 He “was by far the meekest” man.
00:02:39 Now, that’s very interesting.
00:02:41 We’d all like to have that said of us, wouldn’t we?
00:02:45 But when we look at what happened
00:02:47 just toward the end of the 40 years in the wilderness,
00:02:51 we see that Moses reacted badly.
00:02:55 And what was it that caused him to do so?
00:02:58 It was because of his reaction
00:03:01 to persons who frustrated him, irritated him,
00:03:05 those who, it seemed, always rejected the word of Jehovah.
00:03:10 So, what’s the lesson in this for us today?
00:03:14 Well, our meekness too
00:03:16 can be challenged in a similar way.
00:03:19 It can be the frustrations of dealing with others.
00:03:24 Or even in these difficult times in which we’re living now
00:03:27 in seeing shortages of food and medicine.
00:03:31 And perhaps seeing persons with their shopping trolleys
00:03:35 full of items that we know they shouldn’t have got
00:03:38 —so many things— but here they are,
00:03:40 getting away with all this produce, and so on.
00:03:45 And yet here we are, we don’t have enough.
00:03:48 Well, that can be a test of meekness.
00:03:51 Looking at television programs
00:03:53 and seeing what the world leaders are saying,
00:03:56 what politicians are arguing about,
00:03:58 can also be a test of meekness.
00:04:01 Seeing prejudice and unfairness in our lives,
00:04:05 all these things
00:04:07 can be just like the situation with Moses.
00:04:11 We can be tested with regard to our meekness.
00:04:15 So now, here’s the question:
00:04:17 What will help us to remain meek?
00:04:21 What will help us to develop meekness?
00:04:24 Well, the first thing we’d like to mention is a very important thing,
00:04:29 and that is for us to strengthen our trust in Jehovah
00:04:33 and to put our hope in him.
00:04:36 So let’s go back to the words that we mentioned in the beginning
00:04:40 taken from Psalm 37.
00:04:43 Let’s read the context,
00:04:45 thinking of what we just discussed
00:04:48 about the tests that we may face now
00:04:51 or even in the future
00:04:53 that might test our meekness.
00:04:56 So in Psalm 37,
00:04:58 let’s read verses 7-11:
00:05:03 “Keep silent before Jehovah
00:05:06 and wait expectantly for him.”
00:05:10 Do we see the key to maintaining meekness?
00:05:14 Yes, waiting on Jehovah.
00:05:17 Then he goes on to say: “Do not be upset by the man
00:05:21 “who succeeds in carrying out his schemes.
00:05:24 “Let go of anger and abandon rage;
00:05:29 “do not become upset and turn to doing evil.
00:05:33 “For evil men will be done away with,
00:05:36 “but those hoping in Jehovah
00:05:40 “will possess the earth.
00:05:42 “Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more;
00:05:47 “you will look at where they were, and they will not be there.
00:05:51 “But the meek will possess the earth,
00:05:54 “and they will find exquisite delight
00:05:58 in the abundance of peace.”
00:06:01 When we read these words,
00:06:04 particularly at this time in which we’re living now,
00:06:06 don’t they take on deeper meaning for us?
00:06:10 Yes, for us to show meekness,
00:06:13 we have to trust fully in Jehovah, our God.
00:06:17 We have to leave things to him.
00:06:19 Some things we know will only be corrected
00:06:22 by what Jehovah does in the near future.
00:06:26 So with that in mind, let’s look at the book of Romans.
00:06:30 If we turn there together to Romans chapter 12,
00:06:34 we notice that a similar thought
00:06:36 to the one described in Psalm 37
00:06:40 is also here in Romans chapter 12,
00:06:44 and let’s read together verses 17-19:
00:06:50 “Return evil for evil to no one.
00:06:55 “Take into consideration what is fine
00:06:58 “from the viewpoint of all men.
00:07:01 “If possible, as far as it depends on you,
00:07:05 “be peaceable with all men.
00:07:08 “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,
00:07:12 “but yield place to the wrath;
00:07:16 “for it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine;
00:07:20 I will repay,’ says Jehovah.”
00:07:25 Now, when it says “yield place to the wrath,” what does that mean?
00:07:30 Well, we know that The Watchtower
00:07:32 has helped us to see that that’s Jehovah’s wrath.
00:07:35 In other words, it’s his right
00:07:39 to rectify all these bad things that are happening.
00:07:44 So rather than presumptuously trying to jump in and right the wrong
00:07:49 and try to react in a negative way
00:07:52 to all these bad things that are happening around us,
00:07:55 some things we realize we have to leave to Jehovah
00:07:59 and allow him to correct the situation.
00:08:03 So that’s the first point:
00:08:05 Strengthen our trust in Jehovah.
00:08:09 Yes, make sure our hope is in him.
00:08:13 The second point is
00:08:15 that we need to actively develop humility.
00:08:19 Now, later, if you check the book
00:08:21 of Zephaniah 2:3,
00:08:25 it mentions there that we need to “seek meekness,”
00:08:28 and it mentions “meek ones of the earth.”
00:08:31 But the footnote to that verse
00:08:33 mentions “humility,” the “humble ones.”
00:08:38 So obviously, then, humility is also connected
00:08:42 with having a mild temper and being meek.
00:08:46 How so?
00:08:47 Well, humility means we respect others.
00:08:51 And of course, included in that is our respect of Jehovah,
00:08:54 allowing him to do what he needs to do
00:08:57 rather than us presumptuously stepping in.
00:09:01 And our final thought we can find in Proverbs chapter 6.
00:09:06 At Proverbs 6:1-3,
00:09:11 here it describes a person who is in a difficult situation.
00:09:16 In this case, they ‘have put up a security for [their] neighbor,’
00:09:20 and now it hasn’t worked out well.
00:09:23 But what does it say to do in verse 3?
00:09:26 “Do this, my son, and free yourself,
00:09:29 for you have fallen into the hand of your neighbor.”
00:09:32 Now, how should we react in a situation like that?
00:09:36 It says: “Go and humble yourself
00:09:40 and urgently plead with your neighbor.”
00:09:43 Now, interestingly, the Hebrew expression here,
00:09:46 “humble yourself,” literally means “stamp yourself down.”
00:09:51 So do we see the lesson?
00:09:53 When we’re faced with a test like Moses was faced with,
00:09:57 what should we do?
00:09:59 Stamp ourselves down!
00:10:01 Yes, hold off that hot temper.
00:10:04 Yes, have full trust and hope in Jehovah,
00:10:08 and in that way, we can be sure
00:10:10 that he will view us as a meek person.
