00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:02.419 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s start by going

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.255 line:10% position:50% align:center
to Hebrews 13:16, please.

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:08.758 line:10% position:50% align:center
Of interest in the English edition

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:10.760 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first word in this verse
is a connective word.

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we give attention

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
to connective words and phrases
in our Bible reading,

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:25.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can gain more insight
as to what the original writer intended,

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
of course, with the holy spirit’s influence.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
A question—but before the question,
let’s look at verse 16.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:39.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Moreover
[so that’s the connective word, moreover],

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:43.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do not forget to do good
and share what you have with others,

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:46.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God is well-pleased
with [these] sacrifices.”

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now the question:

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:54.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is the doing good and sharing with others

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:58.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
referring to sharing the good news
with others in our territory?

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it is not.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:04.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can I say
that with so much confidence?

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
For one thing, for years

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Hebrews 13:16

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:13.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
is cited by itself in <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
the application is not to the preaching work.

00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:20.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now lets give thought
to that connective word.

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:23.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “moreover”

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:26.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
connects verse 16

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:29.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the preceding verse 15.

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:31.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
So lets read verse 15 now.

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:37.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Through him
let us always offer to God a sacrifice

00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:42.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[yes, but specifically a sacrifice]
of praise,

00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:45.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is, the fruit of our lips

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make public declaration to his name.”

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:52.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
So verse 15 had already addressed preaching.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:55.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
The English word “moreover”

00:01:55.765 --> 00:02:00.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
is defined as meaning
“in addition to what was already said.”

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:06.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the “sacrifice of praise” in verse 15,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was cared for.

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:12.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, in verse 16, in addition to that,

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:17.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are these other sacrifices
with which “God is well-pleased.”

00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:22.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you see,
verse 15 is talking about preaching

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:27.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the goal to helping people
become Christ’s disciples.

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:31.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 16 is about doing good
and sharing with fellow believers

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:35.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them remain Christ’s disciples.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:41.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do these other sacrifices
in verse 16 entail?

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:45.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as an example,
please find 2 Corinthians chapter 8

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
—2 Corinthians chapter 8.

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
This involves giving materially
to fellow believers in need.

00:02:53.957 --> 00:02:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true that here
Paul was writing to the Corinthians,

00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:00.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in these few verses about sharing,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s referring to the Macedonian Christians.

00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:07.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, who were they sharing with?

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:09.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was fellow believers.

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:14.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregations in Judea
were suffering hardship and poverty.

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:18.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the Macedonian Christians,
along with others,

00:03:18.047 --> 00:03:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
were collecting money to help with that need.

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Corinthians 8:2-4:

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:28.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During a great test under affliction, 

00:03:28.858 --> 00:03:32.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“their
[that is, the Macedonian Christians, their] 

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:34.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
“abundance of joy and their deep poverty

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:38.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“made the riches of their generosity abound.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it was according to their means,

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:45.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yes, I testify,
it was even beyond their means,

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:48.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“while they on their own initiative

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“kept earnestly begging us
for the privilege of kindly giving,

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to have a share in the relief ministry

00:03:55.785 --> 00:04:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the holy ones [fellow believers].”

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this was not preaching,

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:06.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was certainly a good work
of generosity and sharing.

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:11.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as a side point to our text for today,

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:15.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you notice Paul said at Hebrews 13:16,

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:19.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “Moreover, do not forget

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:22.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
[do not forget] to do good and share.”

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you suppose “do not forget”
was inserted in that sentence?

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get distracted.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:34.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
As imperfect humans,
we may have great intentions,

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
but sometimes we forget to follow through.

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:42.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul’s writing of the second letter
to the Corinthians

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:47.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
was about five or six years
before he wrote to the Hebrews.

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:51.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, when writing to the Hebrews,
he says: “Do not forget.”

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:55.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul may have had in mind
what happened to the Corinthians.

00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:58.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you still in 2 Corinthians chapter 8?

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Corinthians
had great intentions to do good

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:05.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to share with the congregations in Judea,

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:09.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it seems they forgot to follow through.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Corinthians 8:10, 11:

00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:17.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And in this I give my opinion:

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:19.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is for your benefit,

00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:22.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“seeing that already a year ago

00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:24.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you not only initiated the action

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also showed your desire to do it.”

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:30.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had great intentions to contribute,

00:05:30.113 --> 00:05:32.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a year has now elapsed.

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 11: “So now, also complete
what you started to do,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that your readiness to act
may be completed

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the means you have available.”

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:46.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a good reminder
for us not to forget

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:49.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
ones in our congregation
or elsewhere that are in need.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Write yourself a note.

00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:55.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I think to do good to someone,

00:05:55.571 --> 00:06:00.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
I send myself an email
so that I do not forget.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:04.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know, even if we
can’t think of anyone in our congregation

00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:07.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
that needs assistance,
maybe financially,

00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:12.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
we cannot discount
the counsel of Hebrews 13:16.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of those Macedonians;

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:18.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
they went outside of the border
of their congregation territory

00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give financially.

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:26.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us, whether we have much or little,
all of us can contribute something

00:06:27.603 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the worldwide work,

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:32.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we think
of the number of disasters

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:35.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are affecting our brothers worldwide.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the organization
can direct those funds

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:42.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
to needy brothers and sisters
that we don’t even know,

00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:46.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Paul directed the contributions
in the first century.

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:51.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in addition
to providing relief financially,

00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:54.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
some do good and share

00:06:54.263 --> 00:06:58.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being physically involved
in disaster relief

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
—securing homes that have been damaged,
restoring Kingdom Halls.

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:07.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah is well-pleased
with all of these.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:12.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in what other ways
can we do good and share?

00:07:12.148 --> 00:07:15.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing hospitality in some way.

00:07:15.318 --> 00:07:17.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 12:13 encourages us

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “follow the course of hospitality.”

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the time in preparing

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:26.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
and giving a Scriptural talk,

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:30.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
that falls into the category
of Hebrews 13:16.

00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:37.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now,
what else could fall in that category?

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about an encouraging shepherding visit

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:43.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
or helping a sick one or helping the elderly?

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:46.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
These all fall into that giving.

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:51.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
You recall at Hebrews 13:15,

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:55.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
it spoke of “a sacrifice of praise”

00:07:55.358 --> 00:07:58.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this “public declaration”
of Jehovah’s name,

00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:01.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaching to unbelievers,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas verse 16

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:07.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
refers to talking to believers,

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:12.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
assisting them with these other sacrifices,
some of which we’ve mentioned.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:17.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, which is the most important
of those two verses,

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:19.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
15 or 16?

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
A 2009 <i>Watchtower </i> asked:

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Which of these two Christian activities
is more important?”

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:29.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
It then said:

00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:33.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Asking a question like that
is similar to asking about a bird,

00:08:33.162 --> 00:08:35.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Which of his two wings are more important?

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:38.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, the answer is obvious.

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:40.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘A bird cannot get into the air

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘with only one wing operational.

00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:45.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He needs both wings equally.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Like this bird,

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘we need to share in both aspects

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘of our service to God

in order to be complete Christians.’

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.720 line:90% position:50% align:center

said of these two responsibilities

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they complement one another.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then we can soar,

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that Jehovah is well-pleased

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:08.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all such sacrifices.
