00:00:01 Let’s start by going
00:00:02 to Hebrews 13:16, please.
00:00:06 Of interest in the English edition
00:00:08 of the New World Translation,
00:00:10 the first word in this verse is a connective word.
00:00:15 And when we give attention
00:00:17 to connective words and phrases in our Bible reading,
00:00:20 we can gain more insight as to what the original writer intended,
00:00:25 of course, with the holy spirit’s influence.
00:00:29 A question—but before the question, let’s look at verse 16.
00:00:34 It says: “Moreover [so that’s the connective word, moreover],
00:00:39 “do not forget to do good and share what you have with others,
00:00:43 for God is well-pleased with [these] sacrifices.”
00:00:46 So now the question:
00:00:49 Is the doing good and sharing with others
00:00:54 referring to sharing the good news with others in our territory?
00:00:59 No, it is not.
00:01:01 Well, how can I say that with so much confidence?
00:01:04 For one thing, for years
00:01:07 when Hebrews 13:16
00:01:09 is cited by itself in The Watchtower,
00:01:13 the application is not to the preaching work.
00:01:17 Well, now lets give thought to that connective word.
00:01:21 The word “moreover”
00:01:23 connects verse 16
00:01:26 to the preceding verse 15.
00:01:29 So lets read verse 15 now.
00:01:32 It says: “Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice
00:01:37 “[yes, but specifically a sacrifice] of praise,
00:01:42 “that is, the fruit of our lips
00:01:45 that make public declaration to his name.”
00:01:47 So verse 15 had already addressed preaching.
00:01:53 The English word “moreover”
00:01:55 is defined as meaning “in addition to what was already said.”
00:02:01 So the “sacrifice of praise” in verse 15,
00:02:06 that was cared for.
00:02:08 But now, in verse 16, in addition to that,
00:02:12 there are these other sacrifices with which “God is well-pleased.”
00:02:18 So you see, verse 15 is talking about preaching
00:02:22 with the goal to helping people become Christ’s disciples.
00:02:27 Verse 16 is about doing good and sharing with fellow believers
00:02:31 to help them remain Christ’s disciples.
00:02:36 Now, what do these other sacrifices in verse 16 entail?
00:02:42 Well, as an example, please find 2 Corinthians chapter 8
00:02:47 —2 Corinthians chapter 8.
00:02:49 This involves giving materially to fellow believers in need.
00:02:53 Now, it’s true that here Paul was writing to the Corinthians,
00:02:57 but in these few verses about sharing,
00:03:00 he’s referring to the Macedonian Christians.
00:03:05 Now, who were they sharing with?
00:03:07 It was fellow believers.
00:03:09 The congregations in Judea were suffering hardship and poverty.
00:03:14 So the Macedonian Christians, along with others,
00:03:18 were collecting money to help with that need.
00:03:21 Second Corinthians 8:2-4:
00:03:25 “During a great test under affliction,
00:03:28 “their [that is, the Macedonian Christians, their]
00:03:32 “abundance of joy and their deep poverty
00:03:34 “made the riches of their generosity abound.
00:03:39 “For it was according to their means,
00:03:42 “yes, I testify, it was even beyond their means,
00:03:45 “while they on their own initiative
00:03:48 “kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of kindly giving,
00:03:52 “to have a share in the relief ministry
00:03:55 for the holy ones [fellow believers].”
00:04:00 So this was not preaching,
00:04:02 but it was certainly a good work of generosity and sharing.
00:04:08 Now, as a side point to our text for today,
00:04:11 did you notice Paul said at Hebrews 13:16,
00:04:15 he said: “Moreover, do not forget
00:04:19 [do not forget] to do good and share.”
00:04:22 Why do you suppose “do not forget” was inserted in that sentence?
00:04:28 We get distracted.
00:04:30 As imperfect humans, we may have great intentions,
00:04:34 but sometimes we forget to follow through.
00:04:38 Now, Paul’s writing of the second letter to the Corinthians
00:04:42 was about five or six years before he wrote to the Hebrews.
00:04:47 So now, when writing to the Hebrews, he says: “Do not forget.”
00:04:51 Paul may have had in mind what happened to the Corinthians.
00:04:56 Are you still in 2 Corinthians chapter 8?
00:04:59 The Corinthians had great intentions to do good
00:05:02 and to share with the congregations in Judea,
00:05:05 but it seems they forgot to follow through.
00:05:10 Second Corinthians 8:10, 11:
00:05:14 “And in this I give my opinion:
00:05:17 “This is for your benefit,
00:05:19 “seeing that already a year ago
00:05:22 “you not only initiated the action
00:05:24 but also showed your desire to do it.”
00:05:26 They had great intentions to contribute,
00:05:30 but a year has now elapsed.
00:05:32 Verse 11: “So now, also complete what you started to do,
00:05:37 “so that your readiness to act may be completed
00:05:40 according to the means you have available.”
00:05:43 Well, that’s a good reminder for us not to forget
00:05:46 ones in our congregation or elsewhere that are in need.
00:05:49 Write yourself a note.
00:05:52 When I think to do good to someone,
00:05:55 I send myself an email so that I do not forget.
00:06:00 But, you know, even if we can’t think of anyone in our congregation
00:06:04 that needs assistance, maybe financially,
00:06:08 we cannot discount the counsel of Hebrews 13:16.
00:06:12 Think of those Macedonians;
00:06:14 they went outside of the border of their congregation territory
00:06:18 to give financially.
00:06:21 All of us, whether we have much or little, all of us can contribute something
00:06:27 to the worldwide work,
00:06:29 especially when we think of the number of disasters
00:06:32 that are affecting our brothers worldwide.
00:06:35 And then the organization can direct those funds
00:06:38 to needy brothers and sisters that we don’t even know,
00:06:42 just as Paul directed the contributions in the first century.
00:06:48 Well, in addition to providing relief financially,
00:06:51 some do good and share
00:06:54 by being physically involved in disaster relief
00:06:58 —securing homes that have been damaged, restoring Kingdom Halls.
00:07:03 Well, Jehovah is well-pleased with all of these.
00:07:07 Well, in what other ways can we do good and share?
00:07:12 Sharing hospitality in some way.
00:07:15 Romans 12:13 encourages us
00:07:17 to “follow the course of hospitality.”
00:07:21 And the time in preparing
00:07:24 and giving a Scriptural talk,
00:07:26 that falls into the category of Hebrews 13:16.
00:07:32 But now, what else could fall in that category?
00:07:37 How about an encouraging shepherding visit
00:07:40 or helping a sick one or helping the elderly?
00:07:43 These all fall into that giving.
00:07:49 You recall at Hebrews 13:15,
00:07:51 it spoke of “a sacrifice of praise”
00:07:55 and this “public declaration” of Jehovah’s name,
00:07:58 preaching to unbelievers,
00:08:01 whereas verse 16
00:08:03 refers to talking to believers,
00:08:07 assisting them with these other sacrifices, some of which we’ve mentioned.
00:08:13 Well, which is the most important of those two verses,
00:08:17 15 or 16?
00:08:21 A 2009 Watchtower  asked:
00:08:23 “Which of these two Christian activities is more important?”
00:08:27 It then said:
00:08:29 ‘Asking a question like that is similar to asking about a bird,
00:08:33 ‘Which of his two wings are more important?
00:08:35 ‘Well, the answer is obvious.
00:08:38 ‘A bird cannot get into the air
00:08:40 ‘with only one wing operational.
00:08:42 ‘He needs both wings equally.
00:08:45 ‘Like this bird,
00:08:47 ‘we need to share in both aspects
00:08:49 ‘of our service to God
00:08:51 in order to be complete Christians.’
00:08:54 Well, that Watchtower said of these two responsibilities
00:08:57 that they complement one another.
00:09:00 So then we can soar,
00:09:02 knowing that Jehovah is well-pleased
00:09:05 with all such sacrifices.
