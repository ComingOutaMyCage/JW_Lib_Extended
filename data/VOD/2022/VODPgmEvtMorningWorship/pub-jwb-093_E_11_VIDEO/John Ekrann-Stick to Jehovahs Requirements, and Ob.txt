00:00:01 “Unless you get circumcised . . .
00:00:03 you cannot [get] saved.”
00:00:06 Well, that’s a very strong statement,
00:00:09 especially being made almost 14 years
00:00:12 after Jehovah had made clear that he had
00:00:14 accepted uncircumcised Gentiles
00:00:17 as anointed Christians.
00:00:20 So let’s discuss two lessons that we can learn from this account.
00:00:23 A first lesson:
00:00:25 Do we place our own conditions on others to be saved?
00:00:32 Imagine how the Gentile Christians felt.
00:00:35 Brothers associated with the governing body of that time said,
00:00:38 “Unless you get circumcised . . . , you cannot [get] saved.”
00:00:42 As a Gentile brother, you had made great changes in your life
00:00:46 and morals to become a Christian.
00:00:49 You gave up the worship of pagan gods and the lifestyle
00:00:52 that was associated with that to be a Christian.
00:00:55 Maybe you endured a lot of family opposition,
00:00:59 and now you’re being told you’re not doing enough.
00:01:04 It must have been very discouraging for them,
00:01:07 especially if they already had feelings
00:01:10 that they weren’t already doing enough.
00:01:14 The governing body sent a letter that clearly stated
00:01:17 what was required for them to be saved.
00:01:21 And look at the reaction of the congregation.
00:01:24 If we look at Acts chapter 15
00:01:27 and verses 30 and 31,
00:01:31 here’s how the congregation reacted to this letter.
00:01:34 It says: “So when these men were dismissed, they went down to Antioch,
00:01:37 “and they gathered the whole group together and handed them the letter.
00:01:41 After reading it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.”
00:01:47 So how reassured the Gentile Christians must have been to get that letter!
00:01:52 What a lesson for us not to allow pride
00:01:56 or a self-righteous spirit to push us
00:01:59 to add our own requirements for being saved
00:02:03 instead of sticking to what Jehovah requires!
00:02:07 Now, it’s not just strong words that can make others feel like they’re not doing enough.
00:02:11 This can also happen by our actions.
00:02:14 And we have an example of that in Peter’s actions,
00:02:17 because Peter goes to visit Antioch
00:02:20 a few months after the governing body
00:02:23 had that meeting on the issue of circumcision.
00:02:27 If we look at Galatians chapter 2,
00:02:30 verses 11 and 12, the apostle Paul tells us what happened.
00:02:35 Galatians 2:11, 12: “However, when Cephas came to Antioch,
00:02:40 “I resisted him face-to-face, because he was clearly in the wrong.
00:02:45 “For before certain men from James arrived,
00:02:47 “he used to eat with people of the nations; but when they arrived,
00:02:52 “he stopped doing this and separated himself,
00:02:55 fearing those of the circumcised class.”
00:02:59 Now, it’s interesting that the study note on these verses says this:
00:03:04 “Peter’s conduct could have undermined a decision
00:03:07  “that the governing body [had] made
00:03:09 “in the same year as Peter’s visit, about 49 C.E.
00:03:13 “[Now,] that decision had confirmed that Gentile Christians
00:03:17 “were not required to obey the Mosaic Law.
00:03:21 “[And] Paul here reviews the incident at Antioch, not to embarrass Peter,
00:03:25 but to adjust a wrong view held among the Galatians.”
00:03:30 So Peter, in this case, did not say to people,
00:03:33 ‘You must be circumcised,’
00:03:36 but by not eating with the Gentile friends
00:03:40 while “certain men from James” were there,
00:03:42 his actions had a similar chilling effect.
00:03:46 He made the Gentile brothers feel inferior
00:03:49 to the Jewish Christians who were circumcised.
00:03:53 Now, could we make others feel that way?
00:03:56 One sister told us an experience she had on a tour group
00:03:59 for an international convention.
00:04:02 Another sister in the same group
00:04:04 would ask each person in the group, “Are you a pioneer?”
00:04:08 Now, if the person answered yes,
00:04:10 she spent time talking to them and getting to know them.
00:04:12 If the person said no, she moved on very quickly.
00:04:17 When the sister came to our sister and asked her,
00:04:20 she said she wasn’t a pioneer, and the sister moved on quickly.
00:04:24 Our sister said it made her feel awful.
00:04:28 She already felt like she wasn’t doing enough to serve Jehovah.
00:04:31 She had been a pioneer, but now she was taking care
00:04:35 of her sick parents.
00:04:37 So, what is the lesson for us?
00:04:39 By our words or by our actions,
00:04:43 we can add our own requirements to being saved,
00:04:46 which can really discourage others.
00:04:49 If we stick, though, to Jehovah’s requirements for being saved,
00:04:54 we can rejoice along with our brothers and sisters.
00:04:59 Here’s a second lesson:
00:05:02 Do we recognize when we need to take a question or a matter to oversight?
00:05:07 The brothers who had told the Gentiles,
00:05:09 ‘You must be circumcised in order to be saved,’
00:05:12 had really taken it upon themselves to speak for the governing body of that time.
00:05:18 The governing body said at Acts 15:24:
00:05:22 ‘Be assured that message did not come from us.’
00:05:27 So, clearly, those brothers did not speak for the governing body.
00:05:32 Now, Paul and Barnabas were faced with the same question about circumcision.
00:05:37 Would they make the same mistake and take it upon themselves
00:05:40 to speak for the governing body?
00:05:43 To assist Paul to handle the matter correctly,
00:05:47 his overseer, Jesus, provided some direction.
00:05:52 In Galatians 2:2,
00:05:56 the apostle Paul says that he took the matter to Jerusalem
00:06:00 “as a result of a revelation.”
00:06:04 And again, if you look at the study note on Galatians 2:2,
00:06:09 it says this: “Paul here adds a detail
00:06:12 “not found in Luke’s account in the book of Acts.
00:06:15 “Christ, as the head of the Christian congregation,
00:06:18 “apparently used a revelation
00:06:21 “to direct Paul to bring the important issue of circumcision
00:06:25 to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.”
00:06:29 Yes, Jesus directed Paul to work through the governing body.
00:06:35 Now, I suppose Jesus could have simply told Paul in the revelation:
00:06:38 ‘Paul, you understand it correctly.
00:06:40 Just go ahead and handle it.’
00:06:42 And I’m sure Paul would have probably thought that would have been a lot easier.
00:06:45 ‘I don’t have to go all the way to Jerusalem.
00:06:47 ‘I don’t have to deal with all those other brothers
00:06:49 that have these strong views about circumcision.’
00:06:52 But, rather, Jesus was training Paul and others
00:06:56 on how he wanted questions like this to be handled
00:06:59 —through the governing body.
00:07:01 Jesus did not bypass the arrangement that he had set up.
00:07:06 And the fact that Jesus handled the matter this way back then
00:07:10 sets an example for us today
00:07:12 of how Jesus expects his modern-day organization to work as well.
00:07:18 So we might ask, ‘Do we recognize when we need
00:07:20 to take a question or a matter to a higher authority?’
00:07:23 Well, it’s not always easy, is it?
00:07:25 Can I decide this one on my own, or do I need to ask?
00:07:30 Proverbs 13:10 says:
00:07:32 “Presumptuousness leads only to strife,
00:07:35 but wisdom belongs to those who seek advice.”
00:07:40 Wives have to decide,
00:07:42 ‘Can I make this decision on my own, or do I need to take it to my husband?’
00:07:46 Elders, ‘Can I make this decision on my own, or do I take it to the body of elders?’
00:07:51 Body of elders need to take it to the circuit overseer
00:07:54 or to the branch office, and so on it goes.
00:07:57 I’m sure we have all had moments when we’ve made a decision
00:08:01 or sometimes we’re about to take action and someone says to us:
00:08:05 “Did you ask oversight about that?”
00:08:07 “Uh, well, no.”
00:08:10 “Don’t you think we should?”
00:08:12 “Uh, yeah, that would be a great idea.”
00:08:16 See, those are a learning experiences.
00:08:19 By experience and training,
00:08:21 we learn what things we can and should handle
00:08:24 and what things need to be taken to our oversight.
00:08:29 So in review, our first lesson:
00:08:31 By our words or actions,
00:08:33 we can add our own requirements for being saved,
00:08:36 which can really discourage others.
00:08:38 However, if we stick to Jehovah’s requirements for being saved,
00:08:42 we can rejoice along with our brothers and sisters.
00:08:45 And our second lesson:
00:08:47 Like Paul, be obedient.
00:08:50 Be ready to be trained in how to handle matters
00:08:54 according to theocratic direction.
