00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:03.820 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Unless you get circumcised . . .

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.855 line:10% position:50% align:center
you cannot [get] saved.”

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:09.559 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a very strong statement,

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.562 line:10% position:50% align:center
especially being made almost 14 years

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:14.931 line:10% position:50% align:center
after Jehovah had made clear that he had

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.701 line:10% position:50% align:center
accepted uncircumcised Gentiles

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
as anointed Christians.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:23.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s discuss two lessons
that we can learn from this account.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
A first lesson:

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:30.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we place our own conditions
on others to be saved?

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:35.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how the Gentile Christians felt.

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:38.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers associated
with the governing body of that time said,

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:41.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Unless you get circumcised . . . ,
you cannot [get] saved.”

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a Gentile brother,
you had made great changes in your life

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:49.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and morals to become a Christian.

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:52.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
You gave up the worship
of pagan gods and the lifestyle

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:55.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was associated
with that to be a Christian.

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:59.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you endured a lot of family opposition,

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:02.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now you’re being told
you’re not doing enough.

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:07.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
It must have been very discouraging for them,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially if they already had feelings

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:12.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they weren’t already doing enough.

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:17.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
The governing body
sent a letter that clearly stated

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:21.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was required for them to be saved.

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at the reaction of the congregation.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at Acts chapter 15

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:29.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 30 and 31,

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
here’s how the congregation
reacted to this letter.

00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:37.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “So when these men were dismissed,
they went down to Antioch,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they gathered the whole group together
and handed them the letter.

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:46.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
After reading it,
they rejoiced over the encouragement.”

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how reassured the Gentile Christians
must have been to get that letter!

00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a lesson for us not to allow pride

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a self-righteous spirit to push us

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:03.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
to add our own requirements for being saved

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of sticking to what Jehovah requires!

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:11.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s not just strong words that can make
others feel like they’re not doing enough.

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:14.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can also happen by our actions.

00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:17.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have an example
of that in Peter’s actions,

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Peter goes to visit Antioch

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few months after the governing body

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:27.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
had that meeting
on the issue of circumcision.

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:30.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at Galatians chapter 2,

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:34.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 11 and 12,
the apostle Paul tells us what happened.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:40.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 2:11, 12:
“However, when Cephas came to Antioch,

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:45.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I resisted him face-to-face,
because he was clearly in the wrong.

00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:47.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For before certain men from James arrived,

00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:52.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he used to eat with people of the nations;
but when they arrived,

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he stopped doing this and separated himself,

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
fearing those of the circumcised class.”

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:03.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s interesting that the study note
on these verses says this:

00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peter’s conduct
could have undermined a decision

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
 “that the governing body [had] made

00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:13.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the same year
as Peter’s visit, about 49 C.E.

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:17.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Now,] that decision
had confirmed that Gentile Christians

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:21.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were not required to obey the Mosaic Law.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:25.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[And] Paul here reviews the incident
at Antioch, not to embarrass Peter,

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to adjust a wrong view
held among the Galatians.”

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Peter, in this case,
did not say to people,

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:36.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You must be circumcised,’

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by not eating with the Gentile friends

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
while “certain men from James” were there,

00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:46.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
his actions had a similar chilling effect.

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:49.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made the Gentile brothers feel inferior

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Jewish Christians
who were circumcised.

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:56.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, could we make others feel that way?

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister told us an experience
she had on a tour group

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an international convention.

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another sister in the same group

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:08.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
would ask each person in the group,
“Are you a pioneer?”

00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:10.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if the person answered yes,

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
she spent time talking to them
and getting to know them.

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:15.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the person said no,
she moved on very quickly.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the sister came to our sister
and asked her,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
she said she wasn’t a pioneer,
and the sister moved on quickly.

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:28.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister said it made her feel awful.

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:31.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
She already felt like she wasn’t
doing enough to serve Jehovah.

00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:35.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had been a pioneer,
but now she was taking care

00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
of her sick parents.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is the lesson for us?

00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:43.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
By our words or by our actions,

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can add
our own requirements to being saved,

00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:49.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
which can really discourage others.

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we stick, though,
to Jehovah’s requirements for being saved,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can rejoice
along with our brothers and sisters.

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:01.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a second lesson:

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:07.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we recognize when we need
to take a question or a matter to oversight?

00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers who had told the Gentiles,

00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:12.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You must be circumcised
in order to be saved,’

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:17.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
had really taken it upon themselves to speak
for the governing body of that time.

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
The governing body said at Acts 15:24:

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:26.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Be assured that message
did not come from us.’

00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:31.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, clearly, those brothers
did not speak for the governing body.

00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:37.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul and Barnabas were faced
with the same question about circumcision.

00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:40.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would they make the same mistake
and take it upon themselves

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:42.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak for the governing body?

00:05:43.793 --> 00:05:46.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
To assist Paul
to handle the matter correctly,

00:05:47.663 --> 00:05:51.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
his overseer, Jesus, provided some direction.

00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:56.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Galatians 2:2,

00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:00.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul says
that he took the matter to Jerusalem

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:03.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a result of a revelation.”

00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:09.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again, if you look
at the study note on Galatians 2:2,

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:12.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says this:
“Paul here adds a detail

00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:15.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not found in Luke’s account
in the book of Acts.

00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Christ, as the head
of the Christian congregation,

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:21.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“apparently used a revelation

00:06:21.564 --> 00:06:25.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to direct Paul to bring
the important issue of circumcision

00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:28.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.”

00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:34.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jesus directed Paul
to work through the governing body.

00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:38.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I suppose Jesus could have
simply told Paul in the revelation:

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:40.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Paul, you understand it correctly.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just go ahead and handle it.’

00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m sure Paul would have probably
thought that would have been a lot easier.

00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t have to go all the way to Jerusalem.

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:49.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t have to deal
with all those other brothers

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:52.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have these strong views
about circumcision.’

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:56.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, rather,
Jesus was training Paul and others

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:59.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how he wanted
questions like this to be handled

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:01.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
—through the governing body.

00:07:01.637 --> 00:07:05.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not bypass
the arrangement that he had set up.

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:10.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the fact that Jesus
handled the matter this way back then

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
sets an example for us today

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:16.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how Jesus expects
his modern-day organization to work as well.

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:20.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we might ask,
‘Do we recognize when we need

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take a question
or a matter to a higher authority?’

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s not always easy, is it?

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:30.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I decide this one on my own,
or do I need to ask?

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 13:10 says:

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Presumptuousness leads only to strife,

00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
but wisdom belongs to those who seek advice.”

00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:42.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wives have to decide,

00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:46.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Can I make this decision on my own,
or do I need to take it to my husband?’

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:51.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders, ‘Can I make this decision on my own,
or do I take it to the body of elders?’

00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:54.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Body of elders need to take it
to the circuit overseer

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:57.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to the branch office,
and so on it goes.

00:07:57.426 --> 00:08:01.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure we have all had moments
when we’ve made a decision

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:05.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
or sometimes we’re about to take action
and someone says to us:

00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:07.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Did you ask oversight about that?”

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Uh, well, no.”

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:12.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t you think we should?”

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:15.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Uh, yeah, that would be a great idea.”

00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:19.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, those are a learning experiences.

00:08:19.115 --> 00:08:21.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
By experience and training,

00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:24.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn what things we can and should handle

00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:28.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what things need
to be taken to our oversight.

00:08:29.392 --> 00:08:31.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in review, our first lesson:

00:08:31.394 --> 00:08:33.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
By our words or actions,

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can add
our own requirements for being saved,

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:38.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
which can really discourage others.

00:08:38.734 --> 00:08:42.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, if we stick
to Jehovah’s requirements for being saved,

00:08:42.138 --> 00:08:45.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can rejoice
along with our brothers and sisters.

00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:47.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our second lesson:

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Paul, be obedient.

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:54.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be ready to be trained
in how to handle matters

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:57.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to theocratic direction.
