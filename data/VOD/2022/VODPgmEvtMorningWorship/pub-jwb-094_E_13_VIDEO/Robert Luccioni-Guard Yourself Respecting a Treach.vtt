00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.953 line:10% position:50% align:center
Malachi 2:15:

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:05.955 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Do not deal treacherously

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:07.857 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the wife of your youth.”

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:09.759 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, in Malachi’s day,

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.194 line:10% position:50% align:center
apparently Jewish husbands

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:13.296 line:10% position:50% align:center
were dealing treacherously with their wives

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:15.165 line:10% position:50% align:center
by divorcing them,

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes on frivolous grounds

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:20.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps so as to marry younger women.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the term “treacherously”
was very appropriate.

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here the Hebrew word means

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “deal deceitfully, . . . unfaithfully.”

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:32.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
A form of this verb means to be a traitor.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:34.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how Jehovah feels about this

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
is no wonder that he says what he does
in verse 16,

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he says:
“For I hate divorce.”

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:44.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hates treacherous, deceitful conduct.

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:47.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hates traitors.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Proverbs 2:22,
it says that “the treacherous

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be torn away from [the earth.]”

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, happily, the majority of marriages
in Jehovah’s organization

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not experience such treachery.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, caution is still needed.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, it’s possible
for even a once beautiful relationship

00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:06.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to begin to sour.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
And not only in marriage,

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:12.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in any relationship:
between two very close friends,

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
between us and the organization,
even between us and Jehovah.

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:18.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in Malachi chapter 2,

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:22.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah here gives us a formula
for never letting things get to that point.

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:25.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look again at the latter part of verse 15.

00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:29.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says:
“So guard yourselves respecting your spirit,

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:31.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not deal treacherously.”

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 16, the latter part of it says:

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:37.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And guard yourselves
respecting your spirit.”

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you think about it.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:43.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does somebody get to the point
where they begin to deal treacherously

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:45.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their beloved husband or wife?

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does somebody get to the point

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:51.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
where two friends can no longer speak civilly
with each other?

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does somebody get to the point

00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:57.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they turn
against Jehovah’s organization?

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, see,
long before they get to that point,

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:03.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
something has been brewing under the surface.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:08.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus the comment:
“Guard yourselves respecting your spirit.”

00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:10.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why is that appropriate?

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, grudges, harsh words,
unresolved misunderstandings,

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
questioning decisions that are made,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
see, this can begin to fester

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and begin to rot a relationship
from the inside out

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:25.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
if left unchecked.

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:29.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we can see this by looking at
(illustrate this by looking at) the example

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
of two traitors in the Bible,

00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:36.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abiathar and also Judas.

00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:41.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Abiathar was a high priest
who stuck with David right from the beginning

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Saul was trying to kill him
through David’s kingship.

00:02:44.714 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when Absalom turned traitor
and tried to take over the kingship,

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abiathar was faithful to David.

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
But later in life, Abiathar became a traitor.

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:59.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sided with David’s other son Adonijah

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he tried to take over the kingship.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were there some unresolved issues
that Abiathar buried?

00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:11.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1 Samuel chapter 22,
it’s recorded

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:16.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
where King Saul had Doeg kill
Abiathar’s father, who was the high priest,

00:03:16.312 --> 00:03:20.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 85 other priests
because David went to Abiathar’s father

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked him for some bread
and also a sword.

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:28.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only Abiathar escaped,
and he joined David’s camp.

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:31.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, was this
an unresolved issue with Abiathar?

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:34.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he secretly always have in his mind,

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know,
if David had never involved my family,

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps my father would still be alive’?

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:42.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then there could be
what could be seen as a rivalry,

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:46.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a competition,
between Abiathar and Zadok.

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:50.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Zadok was also a priest
and a prophet.

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:52.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Chronicles 12:28,

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:56.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s called
“a mighty and courageous young man.”

00:03:56.552 --> 00:04:00.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, he served with Saul
until Saul’s death,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then after Saul’s death,
he joined David’s camp.

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:09.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, from then on,
David used Abiathar and Zadok together.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, they’re usually listed together,

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:16.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s of interest
that Zadok is always listed first,

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:20.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though Abiathar was the high priest.

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:22.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Abiathar secretly maintain

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:27.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
some feelings of jealousy
or animosity toward Zadok?

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:29.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Zadok, though he was a priest,

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wasn’t killed
when Saul exterminated the priests.

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:35.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zadok sided with Saul,

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:38.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now he’s the favored one in David’s camp

00:04:38.127 --> 00:04:40.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
next to Abiathar,
who had been faithful to David

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
right from the beginning!

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:46.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, were there some seeds of competition
that grew between these two men?

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever it was,
what aspect of Abiathar’s spirit

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:52.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
did he not guard

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:56.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
that caused him
to eventually turn traitor against David?

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:58.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another example is that of Judas.

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:02.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed
the ultimate betrayal and treachery.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, no doubt,
Judas at one time loved Jesus dearly

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:08.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoyed
a very close relationship with him.

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:12.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
His very appointment as an apostle
indicates that.

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:14.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judas was also entrusted

00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
with caring for the finances
of Jesus and the Twelve.

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this also reflects favorably on him,

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:23.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when you consider
that this assignment

00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:28.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
wasn’t given to Matthew,
who had experience in handling the finances.

00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:30.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can just picture
Judas there in the beginning,

00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:34.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
listening to Jesus words, eating with him,
laughing with him and the others.

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:37.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
But somewhere along the line,

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
something started to develop in his spirit.

00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:42.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you look in John chapter 6,

00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:45.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read in that account
when many of the disciples

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:49.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
were stumbled by Jesus’ words
regarding his flesh and his blood,

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:51.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they left off following him.

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:56.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 61, John 6:61,
it says that ‘the disciples began to murmur.’

00:05:56.205 --> 00:05:59.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 67,
Jesus asks the Twelve,

00:05:59.175 --> 00:06:02.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
he says:
“You do not want to go also, do you?”

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:06.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we often focus
on Peter’s beautiful words of loyalty.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:07.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also—

00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems that at this point,
Jesus was starting to see

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeds of bitterness
starting to grow in Judas.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:18.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at what it says at John 6:70, 71:

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus answered them:
‘I chose you twelve, did I not?

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:25.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet one of you is a slanderer.’

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was, in fact, speaking
of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot.”

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:33.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, was Judas starting to listen

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who were beginning
to murmur against Jesus?

00:06:36.612 --> 00:06:40.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 12:6,
we’re told that Judas “was a thief.”

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:42.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would take money from the money box.

00:06:42.852 --> 00:06:44.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when did that start?

00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:47.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was that after he saw
some decisions made with the finances

00:06:47.924 --> 00:06:50.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he didn’t quite agree with?

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:52.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to Matthew’s and Mark’s accounts,

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:57.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
it appears that seeing
Mary pour the perfumed oil on Jesus

00:06:57.533 --> 00:06:59.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the last trigger for Judas.

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
He strongly objects,

00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:04.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus strongly rebukes Judas
on that occasion

00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:06.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
right in front of everybody.

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:09.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Judas,
no doubt stung by these words, leaves,

00:07:09.712 --> 00:07:13.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just a few days later,
he betrays Jesus to the priests.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:17.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what is the point?

00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:21.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things happen in our life:

00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:24.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
an injustice, a misunderstanding,

00:07:24.227 --> 00:07:28.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
strong discipline,
being embarrassed in public,

00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:32.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe feelings of jealousy
over privileges that somebody else has.

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:34.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, these things happen to all of us

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
at one time or another
in our life or through our life.

00:07:37.173 --> 00:07:39.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
And each time this happens,

00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:44.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
it drops a little seed, if you will,
into our heart.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if left unchecked,
a poisonous root can begin to grow

00:07:48.784 --> 00:07:52.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
that eventually can cause us
to become a traitor

00:07:52.822 --> 00:07:55.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
against our marriage mate,
against our close friend,

00:07:55.992 --> 00:07:59.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
against the organization,
or even against Jehovah.

00:07:59.362 --> 00:08:01.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we do?

00:08:01.364 --> 00:08:05.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Malachi 2:15:
“Guard yourself respecting your spirit.”

00:08:05.835 --> 00:08:10.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice what it says at Hebrews 12:15

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Hebrews 12:15.

00:08:12.942 --> 00:08:15.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Carefully watch
that no one fails to obtain

00:08:15.778 --> 00:08:17.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the undeserved kindness of God,

00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:21.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that no poisonous root springs up

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:25.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cause trouble and many are defiled by it.”

00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:29.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how do we go about
digging up poisonous roots?

00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:32.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, by following the beautiful principles
we have in the Bible

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:37.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 5:23, 24 and Matthew 18:15.

00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:40.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
When there are problems,
when there are misunderstandings,

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:41.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk it out.

00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:42.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work it out.

00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:44.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not leave them buried and unresolved.

00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:47.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seek to gain our brother or sister.

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:51.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 18:35:
“Forgive [our] brother from [the] heart.”

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:55.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Forgive and let go and move on.

00:08:55.418 --> 00:08:59.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 13:34:
“Love one another.”

00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:04.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to when we fell in love
with our husband or wife.

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:05.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
What caused us to fall in love with them?

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:10.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
What caused us to develop that close bond
between us and our best friend?

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:12.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it that convinced us
that this is the truth?

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to that.

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:16.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, see, every time we do these things,

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:20.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re pulling out
one of those poisonous roots

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stopping it from growing.

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:26.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an ongoing process
that we do over and over again.

00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:31.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may all of us be determined
to guard ourselves respecting our spirit.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is not the time

00:09:33.122 --> 00:09:37.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
to allow any poisonous roots
to begin to grow within us.

00:09:37.593 --> 00:09:42.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep our love for and our relationship
with our mate (if we’re married),

00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our friends, with the organization,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with Jehovah strong.

00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:50.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this will help us
to stay loyal to loved ones

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to Jehovah
now and in the days to come.
