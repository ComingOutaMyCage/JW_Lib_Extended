00:00:01 Malachi 2:15:
00:00:03 “Do not deal treacherously
00:00:05 with the wife of your youth.”
00:00:07 Now, in Malachi’s day,
00:00:09 apparently Jewish husbands
00:00:11 were dealing treacherously with their wives
00:00:13 by divorcing them,
00:00:15 sometimes on frivolous grounds
00:00:17 and perhaps so as to marry younger women.
00:00:20 And the term “treacherously” was very appropriate.
00:00:23 Here the Hebrew word means
00:00:25 to “deal deceitfully, . . . unfaithfully.”
00:00:28 A form of this verb means to be a traitor.
00:00:32 And how Jehovah feels about this
00:00:34 is no wonder that he says what he does in verse 16,
00:00:37 where he says: “For I hate divorce.”
00:00:40 Jehovah hates treacherous, deceitful conduct.
00:00:44 Jehovah hates traitors.
00:00:47 At Proverbs 2:22, it says that “the treacherous
00:00:49 will be torn away from [the earth.]”
00:00:52 Well, happily, the majority of marriages in Jehovah’s organization
00:00:56 do not experience such treachery.
00:00:58 However, caution is still needed.
00:01:00 You see, it’s possible for even a once beautiful relationship
00:01:04 to begin to sour.
00:01:06 And not only in marriage,
00:01:08 but in any relationship: between two very close friends,
00:01:12 between us and the organization, even between us and Jehovah.
00:01:16 Well, in Malachi chapter 2,
00:01:18 Jehovah here gives us a formula for never letting things get to that point.
00:01:22 Look again at the latter part of verse 15.
00:01:25 He says: “So guard yourselves respecting your spirit,
00:01:29 and do not deal treacherously.”
00:01:31 Verse 16, the latter part of it says:
00:01:33 “And guard yourselves respecting your spirit.”
00:01:37 So you think about it.
00:01:39 How does somebody get to the point where they begin to deal treacherously
00:01:43 with their beloved husband or wife?
00:01:45 How does somebody get to the point
00:01:47 where two friends can no longer speak civilly with each other?
00:01:51 How does somebody get to the point
00:01:53 when they turn against Jehovah’s organization?
00:01:57 Well, see, long before they get to that point,
00:01:59 something has been brewing under the surface.
00:02:03 Thus the comment: “Guard yourselves respecting your spirit.”
00:02:08 And why is that appropriate?
00:02:10 Well, grudges, harsh words, unresolved misunderstandings,
00:02:14 questioning decisions that are made,
00:02:16 see, this can begin to fester
00:02:19 and begin to rot a relationship from the inside out
00:02:23 if left unchecked.
00:02:25 Now, we can see this by looking at (illustrate this by looking at) the example
00:02:29 of two traitors in the Bible,
00:02:31 Abiathar and also Judas.
00:02:36 Now, Abiathar was a high priest who stuck with David right from the beginning
00:02:41 when Saul was trying to kill him through David’s kingship.
00:02:44 Even when Absalom turned traitor and tried to take over the kingship,
00:02:49 Abiathar was faithful to David.
00:02:51 But later in life, Abiathar became a traitor.
00:02:55 He sided with David’s other son Adonijah
00:02:59 when he tried to take over the kingship.
00:03:01 What happened?
00:03:02 Were there some unresolved issues that Abiathar buried?
00:03:08 In 1 Samuel chapter 22, it’s recorded
00:03:11 where King Saul had Doeg kill Abiathar’s father, who was the high priest,
00:03:16 and 85 other priests because David went to Abiathar’s father
00:03:20 and asked him for some bread and also a sword.
00:03:24 Only Abiathar escaped, and he joined David’s camp.
00:03:28 Well, was this an unresolved issue with Abiathar?
00:03:31 Did he secretly always have in his mind,
00:03:34 ‘You know, if David had never involved my family,
00:03:36 perhaps my father would still be alive’?
00:03:39 And then there could be what could be seen as a rivalry,
00:03:42 or a competition, between Abiathar and Zadok.
00:03:46 Now, Zadok was also a priest and a prophet.
00:03:50 At 1 Chronicles 12:28,
00:03:52 he’s called “a mighty and courageous young man.”
00:03:56 However, he served with Saul until Saul’s death,
00:04:00 and then after Saul’s death, he joined David’s camp.
00:04:04 Well, from then on, David used Abiathar and Zadok together.
00:04:09 In fact, they’re usually listed together,
00:04:11 but it’s of interest that Zadok is always listed first,
00:04:16 even though Abiathar was the high priest.
00:04:20 Did Abiathar secretly maintain
00:04:22 some feelings of jealousy or animosity toward Zadok?
00:04:27 See, Zadok, though he was a priest,
00:04:29 he wasn’t killed when Saul exterminated the priests.
00:04:32 Zadok sided with Saul,
00:04:35 and now he’s the favored one in David’s camp
00:04:38 next to Abiathar, who had been faithful to David
00:04:40 right from the beginning!
00:04:42 See, were there some seeds of competition that grew between these two men?
00:04:46 Whatever it was, what aspect of Abiathar’s spirit
00:04:50 did he not guard
00:04:52 that caused him to eventually turn traitor against David?
00:04:56 Now, another example is that of Judas.
00:04:58 He showed the ultimate betrayal and treachery.
00:05:02 Now, no doubt, Judas at one time loved Jesus dearly
00:05:06 and enjoyed a very close relationship with him.
00:05:08 His very appointment as an apostle indicates that.
00:05:12 Judas was also entrusted
00:05:14 with caring for the finances of Jesus and the Twelve.
00:05:18 And this also reflects favorably on him,
00:05:21 especially when you consider that this assignment
00:05:23 wasn’t given to Matthew, who had experience in handling the finances.
00:05:28 And we can just picture Judas there in the beginning,
00:05:30 listening to Jesus words, eating with him, laughing with him and the others.
00:05:34 But somewhere along the line,
00:05:37 something started to develop in his spirit.
00:05:40 Now, if you look in John chapter 6,
00:05:42 we read in that account when many of the disciples
00:05:45 were stumbled by Jesus’ words regarding his flesh and his blood,
00:05:49 and they left off following him.
00:05:51 In verse 61, John 6:61, it says that ‘the disciples began to murmur.’
00:05:56 In verse 67, Jesus asks the Twelve,
00:05:59 he says: “You do not want to go also, do you?”
00:06:02 And we often focus on Peter’s beautiful words of loyalty.
00:06:06 But we also—
00:06:07 It seems that at this point, Jesus was starting to see
00:06:10 seeds of bitterness starting to grow in Judas.
00:06:14 Look at what it says at John 6:70, 71:
00:06:19 “Jesus answered them: ‘I chose you twelve, did I not?
00:06:22 “Yet one of you is a slanderer.’
00:06:25 He was, in fact, speaking of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot.”
00:06:30 You see, was Judas starting to listen
00:06:33 to those who were beginning to murmur against Jesus?
00:06:36 At John 12:6, we’re told that Judas “was a thief.”
00:06:40 He would take money from the money box.
00:06:42 Well, when did that start?
00:06:44 Was that after he saw some decisions made with the finances
00:06:47 that he didn’t quite agree with?
00:06:50 According to Matthew’s and Mark’s accounts,
00:06:52 it appears that seeing Mary pour the perfumed oil on Jesus
00:06:57 was the last trigger for Judas.
00:06:59 He strongly objects,
00:07:01 and Jesus strongly rebukes Judas on that occasion
00:07:04 right in front of everybody.
00:07:06 And Judas, no doubt stung by these words, leaves,
00:07:09 and just a few days later, he betrays Jesus to the priests.
00:07:14 Well, what is the point?
00:07:17 Things happen in our life:
00:07:21 an injustice, a misunderstanding,
00:07:24 strong discipline, being embarrassed in public,
00:07:28 maybe feelings of jealousy over privileges that somebody else has.
00:07:32 See, these things happen to all of us
00:07:34 at one time or another in our life or through our life.
00:07:37 And each time this happens,
00:07:39 it drops a little seed, if you will, into our heart.
00:07:44 And if left unchecked, a poisonous root can begin to grow
00:07:48 that eventually can cause us to become a traitor
00:07:52 against our marriage mate, against our close friend,
00:07:55 against the organization, or even against Jehovah.
00:07:59 So, what do we do?
00:08:01 Malachi 2:15: “Guard yourself respecting your spirit.”
00:08:05 And notice what it says at Hebrews 12:15
00:08:11 —Hebrews 12:15.
00:08:12 It says: “Carefully watch that no one fails to obtain
00:08:15 “the undeserved kindness of God,
00:08:17 “so that no poisonous root springs up
00:08:21 to cause trouble and many are defiled by it.”
00:08:25 Well, how do we go about digging up poisonous roots?
00:08:29 Well, by following the beautiful principles we have in the Bible
00:08:32 at Matthew 5:23, 24 and Matthew 18:15.
00:08:37 When there are problems, when there are misunderstandings,
00:08:40 talk it out.
00:08:41 Work it out.
00:08:42 Do not leave them buried and unresolved.
00:08:44 Seek to gain our brother or sister.
00:08:47 Matthew 18:35: “Forgive [our] brother from [the] heart.”
00:08:51 Forgive and let go and move on.
00:08:55 John 13:34: “Love one another.”
00:08:59 Think back to when we fell in love with our husband or wife.
00:09:04 What caused us to fall in love with them?
00:09:05 What caused us to develop that close bond between us and our best friend?
00:09:10 What was it that convinced us that this is the truth?
00:09:12 Think back to that.
00:09:14 And, see, every time we do these things,
00:09:16 we’re pulling out one of those poisonous roots
00:09:20 and stopping it from growing.
00:09:22 It’s an ongoing process that we do over and over again.
00:09:26 So may all of us be determined to guard ourselves respecting our spirit.
00:09:31 Now is not the time
00:09:33 to allow any poisonous roots to begin to grow within us.
00:09:37 Keep our love for and our relationship with our mate (if we’re married),
00:09:42 with our friends, with the organization,
00:09:44 and with Jehovah strong.
00:09:47 And this will help us to stay loyal to loved ones
00:09:50 and to Jehovah now and in the days to come.
