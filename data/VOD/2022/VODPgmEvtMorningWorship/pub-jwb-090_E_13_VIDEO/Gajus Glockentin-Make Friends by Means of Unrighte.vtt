00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:02.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
The text reminds us

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.754 line:10% position:50% align:center
of using our financial means

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:07.123 line:10% position:50% align:center
to make friends with Jehovah and Jesus.

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:11.361 line:10% position:50% align:center
And even though Jehovah owns everything,

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:14.197 line:10% position:50% align:center
seeing us giving and making sacrifices

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:15.398 line:10% position:50% align:center
makes him happy.

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:17.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result is a close relationship,

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:22.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
or (in the words of our Scripture text)
we become “friends.”

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:26.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this important principle
was known by the men of old.

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
David, for example, was one of them,

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:32.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was very much interested
in having a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:37.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in 2 Samuel chapter 24,

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find David in a very difficult situation

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his own major mistake

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he has lost Jehovah’s favor.

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what would he do in order to reestablish

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:52.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
this close friendship with Jehovah?

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:57.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
After repenting from his sin and being faced
with the consequences of his wrongdoing,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was told to build “an altar

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the threshing floor of Araunah.”

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us see how David reacted
when Araunah wanted to give

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:09.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
this place to David as a gift.

00:01:09.252 --> 00:01:12.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read at 2 Samuel chapter 24,

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 24:

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:18.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, the king [David] said to Araunah:

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:21.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No, I must buy it from you for a price.

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will not offer up to Jehovah my God

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
“burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.’

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:30.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So David bought the threshing floor

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the cattle for 50 silver shekels.”

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:38.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, it was repentance and obedience
that paved the way

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:41.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
for David to reestablish his friendship
with Jehovah.

00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:44.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as we just read, David understood

00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:48.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
that giving from his own material possessions

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:52.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
—or, in the words of our Scripture text
from today, “from his unrighteous riches”—

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
would make Jehovah happy.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
David wanted to give at a cost.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how are we imitating David
in this regard?

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:04.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us look at some ways how we do this

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:08.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
as individuals, as a congregation,

00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a global organization.

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:15.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we use our financial means
to “make friends” in heaven?

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us first talk
about how we do this as individuals.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:22.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us are being guided
by a Bible principle

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:25.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in 1 Corinthians 16.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:29.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here the apostle Paul
talks about a collection

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
that likely involved money.

00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:35.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation in Corinth was encouraged
to help the Judean Christians.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:39.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what principles did Paul establish
in this connection?

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is 1 Corinthians 16;
we’ll read verse 2:

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:47.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the first day of every week,

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:50.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each of you should set something aside
according to his own means,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that collections will not take place
when I arrive.”

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:59.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul recommended that each Christian
in Corinth make it a priority

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:03.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set something aside
to donate to those in need.

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the principle is to plan our spending

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:11.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make giving a part of it.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is what we can observe:
Despite the fact

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:17.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
that special full-time servants
have very limited financial means,

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
many plan their giving.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many have established
recurring donations on the website

00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:25.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the congregation

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:30.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the organization
for the Kingdom interests worldwide.

00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:34.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way, we do not need
to think about it every month,

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:37.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we might only reconsider it
once in a while

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:42.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see whether our giving
is still in line with our overall budget.

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:45.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much
for what you do in this regard!

00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:49.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
And can you see how Jehovah, your Friend,

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:52.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
loves you for doing this?

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we do as a congregation

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to use our funds
to make friends in heaven?

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:01.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know from the monthly accounts report

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all available funds are being used

00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:07.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
for supporting Kingdom interests.

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:11.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Covering the monthly expenses
of the congregation is part of it.

00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:15.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, in addition to it,
the congregations are applying a principle

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:19.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in 2 Corinthians chapter 8.

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:23.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul referred here
to the collection we read about earlier,

00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:27.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he emphasized the reason
for this collection.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s read 2 Corinthians chapter 8,

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 13 and 14:

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I do not want to make it easy
for others, but difficult for you;

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that by means of an equalizing,

00:04:41.497 --> 00:04:45.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your surplus at the present time
might offset their need,

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:47.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that their surplus might also

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:50.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“offset your deficiency,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there may be an equalizing.”

00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:57.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the congregation in Corinth
was encouraged

00:04:57.447 --> 00:04:59.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use their financial means

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support others who were in need.

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:06.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
This principle of equalizing
is something we find in the congregation

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:09.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, when it comes to donating
for the Kingdom Hall

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Assembly Hall programs.

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:15.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might remember that once a year
the body of elders recommends

00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:17.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
a resolution to the congregation

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
for contributing to the building
and maintenance

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:21.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:23.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
For at least two reasons.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:28.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the congregations themselves

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:31.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
benefit from the Local
Design/Construction arrangement.

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why, for example,
a nearby congregation

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
who just benefited from this arrangement
by remodeling their Kingdom Hall

00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:42.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
increased their monthly contribution
to the program.

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:47.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then there’s this second reason
in line with the principle that we just read:

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is an expression of love
for our brothers in other countries.

00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:54.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a congregation, we want to give.

00:05:54.904 --> 00:05:57.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to make sacrifices

00:05:57.473 --> 00:05:59.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support the building and maintenance

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:02.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
of these places of worship
in other countries,

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
making sacrifices

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:07.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
in support of those who are in need.

00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:12.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation does not just want to give
the leftovers, so to speak,

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:15.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
but supports the arrangement wholeheartedly.

00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:17.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all the brothers and sisters

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are benefiting from this giving spirit

00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:23.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
say thank you,

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:27.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blesses the congregation.

00:06:28.337 --> 00:06:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, finally, how do we
as a global organization

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:35.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
use financial means
in order to make friends in heaven?

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, the Scriptural arrangement
has been put in place

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:43.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Governing Body is entrusted
with decision-making

00:06:43.686 --> 00:06:47.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how to use the financial means
of the organization.

00:06:47.924 --> 00:06:51.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the funds are exclusively used

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:56.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our purposes,
which is our religious purposes.

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s look at one
of the many Bible principles

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:01.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
that apply in using these funds.

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:05.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us, please, turn to Matthew chapter 10.

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:09.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was Jesus who gave this instruction
to his disciples

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
here in Matthew chapter 10.

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:14.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verse 8.

00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:18.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Cure the sick, raise up the dead,

00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:21.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
make lepers clean, expel demons.”

00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:23.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now the principle:

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:26.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You received free, give free.”

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did the apostles follow this directive?

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:31.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:35.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they even continued when Jesus died.

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:39.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now the organization does the very same.

00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:42.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are not selling
our Bibles and publications;

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:44.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are not expecting or asking
for admission fees

00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:47.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our meetings and conventions,

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:51.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are not even having
fundraising events.

00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:54.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we see that, for example, in 2018,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
the organization spent
214 million (U.S.) dollars

00:07:59.162 --> 00:08:01.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
in supporting the circuit overseers,

00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:05.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
the missionaries, and the special pioneers.

00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:07.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then think about the fact

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
that during the same time,

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:15.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
20,331 Bethelites
served at the various branches.

00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:18.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we all got our modest allowance,

00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we all have something to eat.

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:24.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we see that the branch facilities

00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:27.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to be maintained
and have been maintained.

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:30.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think about the “relief ministry.”

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to the voluntary work

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
of so many brothers and sisters

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:38.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in addition to their personal funds

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:40.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they spend in order to help,

00:08:40.903 --> 00:08:43.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
the organization spends millions

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the relief ministry.

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:49.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our activity as a global organization

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not performed in order to make
financial profit

00:08:52.248 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in order to fulfill our assignment
that Jesus gave.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:09:00.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in this way, whether we look at it
as from the perspective of an individual,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:04.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the congregation,
or of the global organization,

00:09:04.594 --> 00:09:08.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us continue to give from what we have.

00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us continue to make sacrifices,

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:15.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will be happy with having
Jehovah and Jesus as our Friends.
