00:00:01 The text reminds us
00:00:02 of using our financial means
00:00:04 to make friends with Jehovah and Jesus.
00:00:07 And even though Jehovah owns everything,
00:00:11 seeing us giving and making sacrifices
00:00:14 makes him happy.
00:00:15 The result is a close relationship,
00:00:17 or (in the words of our Scripture text) we become “friends.”
00:00:22 Now, this important principle was known by the men of old.
00:00:26 David, for example, was one of them,
00:00:28 and he was very much interested in having a close relationship with Jehovah.
00:00:32 Now, in 2 Samuel chapter 24,
00:00:37 we find David in a very difficult situation
00:00:39 because of his own major mistake
00:00:43 —he has lost Jehovah’s favor.
00:00:46 Now, what would he do in order to reestablish
00:00:48 this close friendship with Jehovah?
00:00:52 After repenting from his sin and being faced with the consequences of his wrongdoing,
00:00:57 he was told to build “an altar
00:00:59 on the threshing floor of Araunah.”
00:01:02 Let us see how David reacted when Araunah wanted to give
00:01:06 this place to David as a gift.
00:01:09 We read at 2 Samuel chapter 24,
00:01:12 and verse 24:
00:01:15 “However, the king [David] said to Araunah:
00:01:18 “‘No, I must buy it from you for a price.
00:01:21 “‘I will not offer up to Jehovah my God
00:01:24 “burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.’
00:01:27 “So David bought the threshing floor
00:01:30 and the cattle for 50 silver shekels.”
00:01:33 True, it was repentance and obedience that paved the way
00:01:38 for David to reestablish his friendship with Jehovah.
00:01:41 However, as we just read, David understood
00:01:44 that giving from his own material possessions
00:01:48 —or, in the words of our Scripture text from today, “from his unrighteous riches”—
00:01:52 would make Jehovah happy.
00:01:54 David wanted to give at a cost.
00:01:58 Now, how are we imitating David in this regard?
00:02:01 Let us look at some ways how we do this
00:02:04 as individuals, as a congregation,
00:02:08 and as a global organization.
00:02:10 How do we use our financial means to “make friends” in heaven?
00:02:15 Let us first talk about how we do this as individuals.
00:02:18 Many of us are being guided by a Bible principle
00:02:22 found in 1 Corinthians 16.
00:02:25 Here the apostle Paul talks about a collection
00:02:29 that likely involved money.
00:02:31 The congregation in Corinth was encouraged to help the Judean Christians.
00:02:35 So, what principles did Paul establish in this connection?
00:02:39 This is 1 Corinthians 16; we’ll read verse 2:
00:02:43 “On the first day of every week,
00:02:47 “each of you should set something aside according to his own means,
00:02:50 so that collections will not take place when I arrive.”
00:02:54 Paul recommended that each Christian in Corinth make it a priority
00:02:59 to set something aside to donate to those in need.
00:03:03 So the principle is to plan our spending
00:03:06 to make giving a part of it.
00:03:11 And this is what we can observe: Despite the fact
00:03:13 that special full-time servants have very limited financial means,
00:03:17 many plan their giving.
00:03:19 Many have established recurring donations on the website
00:03:23 for the congregation
00:03:25 and for the organization for the Kingdom interests worldwide.
00:03:30 In this way, we do not need to think about it every month,
00:03:34 but we might only reconsider it once in a while
00:03:37 to see whether our giving is still in line with our overall budget.
00:03:42 Thank you so much for what you do in this regard!
00:03:45 And can you see how Jehovah, your Friend,
00:03:49 loves you for doing this?
00:03:52 Now, what do we do as a congregation
00:03:55 in order to use our funds to make friends in heaven?
00:03:59 We know from the monthly accounts report
00:04:01 that all available funds are being used
00:04:04 for supporting Kingdom interests.
00:04:07 Covering the monthly expenses of the congregation is part of it.
00:04:11 However, in addition to it, the congregations are applying a principle
00:04:15 found in 2 Corinthians chapter 8.
00:04:19 The apostle Paul referred here to the collection we read about earlier,
00:04:23 and he emphasized the reason for this collection.
00:04:27 Now let’s read 2 Corinthians chapter 8,
00:04:30 verses 13 and 14:
00:04:33 “For I do not want to make it easy for others, but difficult for you;
00:04:38 “but that by means of an equalizing,
00:04:41 “your surplus at the present time might offset their need,
00:04:45 “so that their surplus might also
00:04:47 “offset your deficiency,
00:04:50 that there may be an equalizing.”
00:04:54 So the congregation in Corinth was encouraged
00:04:57 to use their financial means
00:04:59 to support others who were in need.
00:05:01 This principle of equalizing is something we find in the congregation
00:05:06 —for example, when it comes to donating for the Kingdom Hall
00:05:09 and Assembly Hall programs.
00:05:11 You might remember that once a year the body of elders recommends
00:05:15 a resolution to the congregation
00:05:17 for contributing to the building and maintenance
00:05:19 of Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.
00:05:21 Why?
00:05:23 For at least two reasons.
00:05:25 First, the congregations themselves
00:05:28 benefit from the Local Design/Construction arrangement.
00:05:31 That is why, for example, a nearby congregation
00:05:34 who just benefited from this arrangement by remodeling their Kingdom Hall
00:05:38 increased their monthly contribution to the program.
00:05:42 But then there’s this second reason in line with the principle that we just read:
00:05:47 It is an expression of love for our brothers in other countries.
00:05:52 As a congregation, we want to give.
00:05:54 We want to make sacrifices
00:05:57 to support the building and maintenance
00:05:59 of these places of worship in other countries,
00:06:02 making sacrifices
00:06:04 in support of those who are in need.
00:06:07 The congregation does not just want to give the leftovers, so to speak,
00:06:12 but supports the arrangement wholeheartedly.
00:06:15 And all the brothers and sisters
00:06:17 who are benefiting from this giving spirit
00:06:21 say thank you,
00:06:23 and Jehovah blesses the congregation.
00:06:28 Now, finally, how do we as a global organization
00:06:31 use financial means in order to make friends in heaven?
00:06:35 First of all, the Scriptural arrangement has been put in place
00:06:39 that the Governing Body is entrusted with decision-making
00:06:43 on how to use the financial means of the organization.
00:06:47 And the funds are exclusively used
00:06:51 for our purposes, which is our religious purposes.
00:06:56 Now, let’s look at one of the many Bible principles
00:06:59 that apply in using these funds.
00:07:01 Let us, please, turn to Matthew chapter 10.
00:07:05 It was Jesus who gave this instruction to his disciples
00:07:09 here in Matthew chapter 10.
00:07:12 Let’s read verse 8.
00:07:15 He said: “Cure the sick, raise up the dead,
00:07:18 make lepers clean, expel demons.”
00:07:21 And now the principle:
00:07:23 “You received free, give free.”
00:07:27 Now, did the apostles follow this directive?
00:07:30 Yes.
00:07:31 And they even continued when Jesus died.
00:07:35 And now the organization does the very same.
00:07:39 We are not selling our Bibles and publications;
00:07:42 we are not expecting or asking for admission fees
00:07:44 to our meetings and conventions,
00:07:47 and we are not even having fundraising events.
00:07:51 But then we see that, for example, in 2018,
00:07:54 the organization spent
214 million (U.S.) dollars
00:07:59 in supporting the circuit overseers,
00:08:01 the missionaries, and the special pioneers.
00:08:05 And then think about the fact
00:08:07 that during the same time,
00:08:10 20,331 Bethelites served at the various branches.
00:08:15 And we all got our modest allowance,
00:08:18 and we all have something to eat.
00:08:20 And then we see that the branch facilities
00:08:24 need to be maintained and have been maintained.
00:08:27 Well, think about the “relief ministry.”
00:08:30 In addition to the voluntary work
00:08:32 of so many brothers and sisters
00:08:35 and in addition to their personal funds
00:08:38 that they spend in order to help,
00:08:40 the organization spends millions
00:08:43 on the relief ministry.
00:08:46 So our activity as a global organization
00:08:49 is not performed in order to make financial profit
00:08:52 but in order to fulfill our assignment that Jesus gave.
00:08:55 So in this way, whether we look at it as from the perspective of an individual,
00:09:00 of the congregation, or of the global organization,
00:09:04 let us continue to give from what we have.
00:09:08 Let us continue to make sacrifices,
00:09:10 and we will be happy with having Jehovah and Jesus as our Friends.
