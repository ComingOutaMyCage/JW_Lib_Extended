00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:04.621 line:10% position:50% align:center
“The harvest”

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.425 line:10% position:50% align:center
—what do those words bring to your mind?

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.894 line:10% position:50% align:center
A resplendent, golden season

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:13.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
with plentiful work and good food?

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:16.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, but isn’t it also true

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the harvest implies urgency?

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:20.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
A harvest can’t wait.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
The crop has to be brought in.

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:26.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rains might cut short
the days or soak the grain.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:30.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone is needed to get the job done.

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:33.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does that suggest
about the way in which

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must work during the figurative harvest
that Jesus was talking about here?

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s examine the context of Jesus’ words

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:44.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning at Matthew 9:35,

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice what Jesus was doing,

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:51.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
how it made him feel,

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:55.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what specific actions
and attitudes he recommended,

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
either directly or by his example.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:02.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 9:35,

00:01:04.514 --> 00:01:08.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “Jesus set out on a tour
of all the cities and villages,

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:12.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“teaching in their synagogues
and preaching the good news of the Kingdom

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:17.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and curing every sort of disease
and every sort of infirmity.”

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was Jesus’ third tour of Galilee.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was teaching, preaching, and curing.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
What effect did it have on him?

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:29.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 36: “On seeing the crowds,
he felt pity for them,

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:34.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they were skinned and thrown
about like sheep without a shepherd.”

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:37.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote tells us
that the verb here for pity

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘denotes a feeling experienced

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘deep inside the body, an intense emotion.

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:45.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It is one of the strongest words

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:49.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Greek for compassion’

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:52.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
—compassion for people who were,
as the footnotes indicate,

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:55.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
maltreated, harassed, wounded, helpless,

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:59.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
exhausted, dejected, and neglected—

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
crowds who needed God’s Kingdom.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, Jesus said in verse 37:

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, the harvest is great,
but the workers are few.”

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The harvest”
—he called it—a short period of time

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:18.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which many people are needed
to accomplish a great work.

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:21.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would Jesus recommend?

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice verse 38, fervent prayer:

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:28.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest

00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:31.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send out workers into his harvest.”

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:34.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did Jesus just leave it at that?

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:35.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:40.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the next verse
in chapter 10 and verse 1.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he summoned his 12 disciples

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and gave them
authority over unclean spirits,

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to expel these
and to cure every sort of disease

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every sort of infirmity.”

00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:54.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the very work

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus was doing back
in chapter 9 and verse 35.

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:02.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here we find Jesus delegating authority

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:05.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and giving his disciples
permission and real power

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
to perform mighty deeds.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also organized his apostles.

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:15.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verses 2-4, we find their names.

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:18.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is not
just a list of names like the one

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:23.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find at Luke 6:13-16.

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Luke listing centers
around events that occurred months earlier

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
before Jesus’ second tour of Galilee,

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:33.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas this listing in Matthew

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:37.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
deals with Jesus’ third tour of Galilee.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whereas Luke’s list contains

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:42.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
12 names and 11 commas
between the complete names,

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
this list separates the names not by commas

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by the word “and”

00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
—used not 11 times but 6 times.

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:57.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, this is a list defining six teams.

00:03:57.253 --> 00:04:01.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in verses 2-4, the apostles get a partner;

00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:04.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 5 and 6, they get a territory;

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 7, they get a message

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
centering on the Kingdom;

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 11 and 12,

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:15.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re told to search out each city

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:20.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
for deserving ones at their homes.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by the way, did Jehovah,
the Master of the harvest,

00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:28.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
answer their plea for more harvest workers?

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:31.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
About a year later, Jesus dispatched

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:35.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
70 more disciples, so 82 in all.

00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:38.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did that relieve some of the pressure

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:42.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reduce
some of the urgency of the situation?

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:44.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice what Jesus said about this

00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:48.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Luke 10:2:

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he said to them:
‘Yes, the harvest is great,

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:56.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but the workers are few.

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:58.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send out workers into his harvest.’”

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
The wording is identical

00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:08.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that found at Matthew 9:37, 38, isn’t it?

00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ assessment of the need

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:15.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
was exactly the same.

00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:19.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, how can we be sure
that all of this applies to us?

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:23.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what Jesus said
right here in his original instructions

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 10:23:

00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:30.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When they persecute you in one city,

00:05:30.813 --> 00:05:33.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“flee to another;
for truly I say to you,

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:37.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will by no means
complete the circuit of the cities of Israel

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the Son of man arrives.”

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, these words apply
not only to those living in the first century

00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:50.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to those living
when the Son of man arrives.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:53.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that also means
that between now and Armageddon,

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be plenty of territory.

00:05:57.073 --> 00:05:59.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, too, that Jesus said

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:03.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 13:38, 39:

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The field is the world”

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:10.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “the harvest
is a conclusion of a system of things.”

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:15.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while it’s true
that we have more workers than ever before,

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
the circumstances keep changing.

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:23.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the harvest season began back in 1914,

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
earth’s population was just then

00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
cresting 1.6 billion.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:32.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, today, billions more
need to hear the truth.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:35.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we do this work as Jesus instructed.

00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:39.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray fervently for more workers,
and we get organized.

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:42.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get a partner, a territory,
a Kingdom presentation,

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we search systematically.

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:48.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past few years,

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:50.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the direction of the Service Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
a number of special preaching campaigns
have been organized

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:58.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
in very remote
or densely populated territories.

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:02.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the results confirm
that the harvest is still great

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:05.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the workers are still few.

00:07:05.274 --> 00:07:08.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
after a recent four-month campaign

00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:13.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach Aymara-speaking people
on the Andean plateau of Peru,

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:15.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
an elder reported
that way up in the mountains,

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:18.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
they found a group of people
meeting twice a week

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:23.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study <i>My Book of Bible Stories</i>
and <i>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</i>

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:26.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the group was surprised
to find out that these books

00:07:26.662 --> 00:07:29.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
were published by Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those conducting the meetings
agreed to study

00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:33.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers during the campaign.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many attended, and they were happy
to find out about our website.

00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now some members of that group

00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:44.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
are continuing their Bible study
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:48.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in our current circumstances,

00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:51.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve been able to reach wide audiences

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
through teleconferencing and broadcasting.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some regions of Africa,
without suitable Internet,

00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:01.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been able to use
television and radio to broadcast

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:05.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only the Memorial
but their regular congregation meetings.

00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:07.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
After one broadcast,

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:12.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
a non-Witness man in Malawi said:

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:15.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Coronavirus has helped me
to hear God’s Word

00:08:15.478 --> 00:08:18.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“explained effectively in a way

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:21.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have never heard before in my whole life.

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:26.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I had no idea that Witnesses
could teach so skillfully.

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:31.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t want to miss
any of these meetings, ever!”

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his comments were typical of many

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were received at the branch office.

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:39.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are still places on this earth

00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:43.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the interest in Bible truth is great

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
—places with vast unassigned territories

00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:50.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
or where travel is difficult

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:54.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
or where other conditions
restrict our movement.

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:56.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re persecuted in one city,

00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:59.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
we flee to the next one

00:08:59.188 --> 00:09:02.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
because this is a harvest.

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:05.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
The grain is ripe;
the time is limited;

00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:07.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
every worker is needed.

00:09:07.997 --> 00:09:11.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, unlike a literal harvest

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:16.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we can sort of size up
the amount of work

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:20.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet to be done by the remainder of crop
that has yet to be gathered,

00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:23.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can’t do that and say:
“We’ve got this.”

00:09:23.512 --> 00:09:28.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
We already know
that we will be working right up to the end.

00:09:28.517 --> 00:09:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as Jesus assures us

00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:34.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 10:22:

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one who has endured

00:09:36.692 --> 00:09:40.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the end will be saved.”
