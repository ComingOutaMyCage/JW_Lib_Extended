00:00:02 “The harvest”
00:00:04 —what do those words bring to your mind?
00:00:08 A resplendent, golden season
00:00:10 with plentiful work and good food?
00:00:14 Yes, but isn’t it also true
00:00:16 that the harvest implies urgency?
00:00:19 A harvest can’t wait.
00:00:20 The crop has to be brought in.
00:00:22 The rains might cut short the days or soak the grain.
00:00:26 Everyone is needed to get the job done.
00:00:30 And what does that suggest about the way in which
00:00:33 we must work during the figurative harvest that Jesus was talking about here?
00:00:38 Let’s examine the context of Jesus’ words
00:00:40 beginning at Matthew 9:35,
00:00:44 and notice what Jesus was doing,
00:00:48 how it made him feel,
00:00:51 and what specific actions and attitudes he recommended,
00:00:55 either directly or by his example.
00:00:59 At Matthew 9:35,
00:01:04 it says: “Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages,
00:01:08 “teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom
00:01:12 and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.”
00:01:17 This was Jesus’ third tour of Galilee.
00:01:20 He was teaching, preaching, and curing.
00:01:23 What effect did it have on him?
00:01:25 Verse 36: “On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them,
00:01:29 because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.”
00:01:34 The footnote tells us that the verb here for pity
00:01:37 ‘denotes a feeling experienced
00:01:39 ‘deep inside the body, an intense emotion.
00:01:43 ‘It is one of the strongest words
00:01:45 in Greek for compassion’
00:01:49 —compassion for people who were, as the footnotes indicate,
00:01:52 maltreated, harassed, wounded, helpless,
00:01:55 exhausted, dejected, and neglected—
00:01:59 crowds who needed God’s Kingdom.
00:02:03 Thus, Jesus said in verse 37:
00:02:06 “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.”
00:02:10 “The harvest” —he called it—a short period of time
00:02:13 in which many people are needed to accomplish a great work.
00:02:18 What would Jesus recommend?
00:02:21 Well, notice verse 38, fervent prayer:
00:02:25 “Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest
00:02:28 to send out workers into his harvest.”
00:02:31 But did Jesus just leave it at that?
00:02:34 Not at all.
00:02:35 Notice the next verse in chapter 10 and verse 1.
00:02:40 “So he summoned his 12 disciples
00:02:43 “and gave them authority over unclean spirits,
00:02:47 “in order to expel these and to cure every sort of disease
00:02:50 and every sort of infirmity.”
00:02:52 This was the very work
00:02:54 that Jesus was doing back in chapter 9 and verse 35.
00:02:58 So here we find Jesus delegating authority
00:03:02 and giving his disciples permission and real power
00:03:05 to perform mighty deeds.
00:03:09 He also organized his apostles.
00:03:11 In verses 2-4, we find their names.
00:03:15 But this is not just a list of names like the one
00:03:18 we find at Luke 6:13-16.
00:03:23 The Luke listing centers around events that occurred months earlier
00:03:27 before Jesus’ second tour of Galilee,
00:03:31 whereas this listing in Matthew
00:03:33 deals with Jesus’ third tour of Galilee.
00:03:37 And whereas Luke’s list contains
00:03:39 12 names and 11 commas between the complete names,
00:03:42 this list separates the names not by commas
00:03:46 but by the word “and”
00:03:49 —used not 11 times but 6 times.
00:03:52 Yes, this is a list defining six teams.
00:03:57 So in verses 2-4, the apostles get a partner;
00:04:01 in verses 5 and 6, they get a territory;
00:04:04 in verse 7, they get a message
00:04:07 centering on the Kingdom;
00:04:09 in verses 11 and 12,
00:04:11 they’re told to search out each city
00:04:15 for deserving ones at their homes.
00:04:20 And by the way, did Jehovah, the Master of the harvest,
00:04:24 answer their plea for more harvest workers?
00:04:28 About a year later, Jesus dispatched
00:04:31 70 more disciples, so 82 in all.
00:04:35 Did that relieve some of the pressure
00:04:38 and reduce some of the urgency of the situation?
00:04:42 Well, notice what Jesus said about this
00:04:44 at Luke 10:2:
00:04:50 “Then he said to them: ‘Yes, the harvest is great,
00:04:54 “‘but the workers are few.
00:04:56 “‘Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest
00:04:58 to send out workers into his harvest.’”
00:05:01 The wording is identical
00:05:03 to that found at Matthew 9:37, 38, isn’t it?
00:05:08 Jesus’ assessment of the need
00:05:12 was exactly the same.
00:05:15 Well, now, how can we be sure that all of this applies to us?
00:05:19 Notice what Jesus said right here in his original instructions
00:05:23 at Matthew 10:23:
00:05:27 “When they persecute you in one city,
00:05:30 “flee to another; for truly I say to you,
00:05:33 “you will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel
00:05:37 until the Son of man arrives.”
00:05:40 Yes, these words apply not only to those living in the first century
00:05:45 but to those living when the Son of man arrives.
00:05:50 And that also means that between now and Armageddon,
00:05:53 there will be plenty of territory.
00:05:57 Remember, too, that Jesus said
00:05:59 at Matthew 13:38, 39:
00:06:03 “The field is the world”
00:06:05 and “the harvest is a conclusion of a system of things.”
00:06:10 So while it’s true that we have more workers than ever before,
00:06:15 the circumstances keep changing.
00:06:18 When the harvest season began back in 1914,
00:06:23 earth’s population was just then
00:06:25 cresting 1.6 billion.
00:06:28 Well, today, billions more need to hear the truth.
00:06:32 So we do this work as Jesus instructed.
00:06:35 We pray fervently for more workers, and we get organized.
00:06:39 We get a partner, a territory, a Kingdom presentation,
00:06:42 and then we search systematically.
00:06:46 In the past few years,
00:06:48 under the direction of the Service Committee of the Governing Body,
00:06:50 a number of special preaching campaigns have been organized
00:06:55 in very remote or densely populated territories.
00:06:58 And the results confirm that the harvest is still great
00:07:02 and that the workers are still few.
00:07:05 For instance, after a recent four-month campaign
00:07:08 to reach Aymara-speaking people on the Andean plateau of Peru,
00:07:13 an elder reported that way up in the mountains,
00:07:15 they found a group of people meeting twice a week
00:07:18 to study My Book of Bible Stories and The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.
00:07:23 Well, the group was surprised to find out that these books
00:07:26 were published by Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:07:29 and those conducting the meetings agreed to study
00:07:31 with our brothers during the campaign.
00:07:33 Many attended, and they were happy to find out about our website.
00:07:38 And now some members of that group
00:07:40 are continuing their Bible study with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:07:45 Even in our current circumstances,
00:07:48 we’ve been able to reach wide audiences
00:07:51 through teleconferencing and broadcasting.
00:07:54 Some regions of Africa, without suitable Internet,
00:07:57 have been able to use television and radio to broadcast
00:08:01 not only the Memorial but their regular congregation meetings.
00:08:05 After one broadcast,
00:08:07 a non-Witness man in Malawi said:
00:08:12 “The Coronavirus has helped me to hear God’s Word
00:08:15 “explained effectively in a way
00:08:18 “I have never heard before in my whole life.
00:08:21 “I had no idea that Witnesses could teach so skillfully.
00:08:26 I don’t want to miss any of these meetings, ever!”
00:08:31 And his comments were typical of many
00:08:33 that were received at the branch office.
00:08:35 Isn’t that beautiful?
00:08:36 There are still places on this earth
00:08:39 where the interest in Bible truth is great
00:08:44 —places with vast unassigned territories
00:08:47 or where travel is difficult
00:08:50 or where other conditions restrict our movement.
00:08:54 If we’re persecuted in one city,
00:08:56 we flee to the next one
00:08:59 because this is a harvest.
00:09:02 The grain is ripe; the time is limited;
00:09:05 every worker is needed.
00:09:07 And yet, unlike a literal harvest
00:09:11 where we can sort of size up the amount of work
00:09:16 yet to be done by the remainder of crop that has yet to be gathered,
00:09:20 we can’t do that and say: “We’ve got this.”
00:09:23 We already know that we will be working right up to the end.
00:09:28 But as Jesus assures us
00:09:30 at Matthew 10:22:
00:09:34 “The one who has endured
00:09:36 to the end will be saved.”
