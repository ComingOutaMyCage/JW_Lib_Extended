00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:02.852 line:10% position:50% align:center
So this scripture

00:00:02.852 --> 00:00:05.155 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’re all very familiar with:

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:06.823 line:10% position:50% align:center
“No man

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:09.159 line:10% position:50% align:center
“can come to me unless the Father,

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.661 line:10% position:50% align:center
who sent me, draws him.”

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:15.432 line:10% position:50% align:center
So that’s a statement inspired by God.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:20.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we reflect on it
—give it a lot of thought—

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:23.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can sense that Jehovah

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
really cares about us as individuals.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:29.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what
we want to develop this morning.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you think of this verse,

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
it just proves Jehovah
cares about us as individuals.

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:38.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s important
because regardless of whoever we are,

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:43.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
from time to time
negative emotions can affect us.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, ‘I know Jehovah
loves all these brothers and sisters,

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:52.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m just not sure about me.’

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:55.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you reflect on this verse,

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:59.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
see, it reassures us
that Jehovah cares about us

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:01.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
as individuals.

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:05.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to help us appreciate this verse

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:09.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our revised <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
find John chapter 21, if you would, please.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:17.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll consider this account here,

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:22.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ll see how it connects
with Jehovah caring about us as individuals

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Scripture text, John 6:44.

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:32.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
You find in verse 2, Simon Peter, Thomas,

00:01:32.108 --> 00:01:34.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the other disciples here.

00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:38.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Peter says in verse 3:
“I am going fishing.”

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:41.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they go along with him,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they go to board the boat
and spend all night,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they didn’t catch a thing.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:49.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s interesting is Jesus

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:52.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
manifests himself here,
according to verse 4,

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:55.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in verse 5, he questions:

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:58.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Children, you do not have anything to eat,
do you?’

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:00.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
They answered: ‘No!’”

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now he directs them:

00:02:02.438 --> 00:02:07.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Cast the net on the right side of the boat
and you will find some.’

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they cast it,

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:13.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they were not able to haul it in

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the large number of fish.”

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the number was large,

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:21.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s specified in verse 11 as “153,”

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:24.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re called “big fish.”

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:28.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for years the 1984 revision

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:32.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
had said in this verse
—and literally in the Greek it’s appropriate

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:35.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
(doesn’t mean it’s a bad translation)—

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>New World Translation</i>
had said they weren’t “able to draw it in.”

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:42.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s appropriate

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nothing technically wrong with it.

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:50.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the revision helps us
appreciate that if you have 153 big fish,

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:55.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if you’ve got strong fishermen,
they’re hauling.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “draw” doesn’t capture it

00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:00.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
in translation.

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:05.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that helps us appreciate now John 6:44.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wouldn’t say “haul.”

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:13.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
It still says “draws him.”

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, it’s a different word, 
and words do matter.

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:19.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we appreciate the revision here.

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:21.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
This makes sense even though

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
the literal Greek is there “to draw.”

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:28.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, see, at John 6:44, “draws” is different.

00:03:28.424 --> 00:03:32.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew his Father

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still knows more about his Father

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
than any person alive.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in no way would he want us to be thinking

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:44.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
that He hauls us in or,
we might say,

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:48.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
drags people into the truth.

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:50.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a priceless lesson

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of us to remember
in our preaching activity,

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:57.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bible study activity,

00:03:57.086 --> 00:04:00.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a parent or parents raising a child.

00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:05.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, sometimes you can come across
like you’re dragging them.

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:08.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
That doesn’t work.

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:12.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is gentle
with his drawing of a person.

00:04:12.302 --> 00:04:15.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
He respects their free will.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of his holy spirit and his Word,

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:21.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll tug at the heart and he draws them.

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:24.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s important
because we have a comment there

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what young people might reason,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, he drew my parent or parents,
but not me.’

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:35.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s erroneous thinking
when you look at what Jesus said here:

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No man [and that includes
the women] can come to me

00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:42.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
unless the Father,
who sent me, draws him.”

00:04:42.465 --> 00:04:46.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s individual attention
that Jehovah gives,

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s priceless.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:50.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever you’re dealing with,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have to pause and think,
‘Well, Jehovah, you drew me.’

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s precious.

00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:59.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’ll get you through
all sorts of negative thinking,

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:04.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you just get rid of it
because the Sovereign of the universe

00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:08.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
drew you into
your baptized relationship with him.

00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:12.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s something
we should always feel special about.

00:05:12.328 --> 00:05:15.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought of different circumstances

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I was meditating on this text.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it brought to mind

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:23.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
an experience I had
back in Providence, Rhode Island.

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:25.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was before my wife and I had children.

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:29.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I remember being at the meeting,
and it was a nice experience.

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:34.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s this young person, late teens,

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:37.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
not looking like one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he just kind of came in,
and I had observed him.

00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:45.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he sits down,
and nobody is talking to him at that point.

00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:47.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I went over and sat next to him:

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:49.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How are you?”
and mentioned my name.

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:55.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Glad to have you here”
and trying to get to know him.

00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:59.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it turns out his mom
was a baptized Witness

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for long not doing anything.

00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:04.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
The family had all sorts of issues.

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:09.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet in spite of all of this,
it occurred to me,

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:14.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah drew this young person to Him
—right to the Kingdom Hall.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:16.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted a Bible study.

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:19.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had all sorts of thoughts.

00:06:19.028 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just because he was so quiet, see,
sometimes that means they’re deep thinkers.

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:26.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was a privilege
to be used by Jehovah to help him.

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:28.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I always appreciated it.

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:32.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he came along,
had different things to deal with,

00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:36.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
ended up married to a nice pioneer sister.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had children they raised in the truth.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s been an elder for a long time.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:06:42.852 --> 00:06:46.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah noticed his mom

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:49.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
—He may have drawn her
at some point in her life.

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the midst
of all of this wrong that’s going on

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and this has happened to more
than one individual Witness,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
where their parent or parents
weren’t living up to it),

00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
here they are serving the true God.

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:06.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it just proves Jehovah
cares for them as an individual.

00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:08.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
He drew them into the truth.

00:07:08.277 --> 00:07:09.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s priceless.

00:07:09.946 --> 00:07:12.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s something
that we should always treasure.

00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:14.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
And parents can learn, too,

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:19.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you’re working with a child or children,

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:22.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay away
from the dragging them into the truth.

00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:24.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not God’s way.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t do it.

00:07:25.394 --> 00:07:29.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know who we think we are,
but you cannot drag anybody,

00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:32.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s a Bible study or your own child,

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:34.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a relationship with God.

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:36.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is not that way.

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:39.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do all we can to set a good example,

00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:42.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
teach the truth, live the truth.

00:07:42.678 --> 00:07:46.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if Jehovah draws them,
they’ve got to connect with him.

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s just something
to appreciate and treasure

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:55.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and recognize
—that Jehovah is the one who draws people.

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just to keep this in mind,

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:03.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you’ll look at John 6:44 once again,

00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:08.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bear this in mind

00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:11.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
whenever you’re dealing with something

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is disturbing
your relationship with God.

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:19.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about how much Jehovah
cares about you as an individual,

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:21.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 44:

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:26.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No man [see, this is the Son of God himself:
No man]

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:30.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
can come to me unless the Father,
who sent me, draws him.”

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so that’s priceless.

00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:34.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has drawn us.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives us personal attention,
and we love him for that.

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:43.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, Psalm 73,
after Jehovah draws us,

00:08:43.406 --> 00:08:47.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have this personal responsibility,

00:08:47.143 --> 00:08:51.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah expects us to fulfill it.

00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:53.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Psalm 73

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
(remembering how much Jehovah
truly cares for us

00:08:57.486 --> 00:09:00.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then that we
have this personal responsibility)

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:03.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the <i>A </i>part of verse 28,

00:09:03.326 --> 00:09:06.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
this should be our resolve personally:

00:09:07.597 --> 00:09:09.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But as for me

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:13.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[you have to say this; I have to say this:
But as for me],

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:17.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
drawing near to God is good for me.”

00:09:17.006 --> 00:09:21.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how good it is
that after Jehovah has drawn us

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:23.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
—given us this personal attention and care—

00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:28.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
now it’s our responsibility
through personal study, meditation,

00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
meaningful prayers that we draw near to God,

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:34.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that’s “good for [us]”!
