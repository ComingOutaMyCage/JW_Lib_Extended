00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:03.720 line:10% position:50% align:center
Have you ever asked, “How long?”

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:05.622 line:10% position:50% align:center
If you’re enduring

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:07.590 line:10% position:50% align:center
some challenging circumstance right now

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.694 line:10% position:50% align:center
—perhaps old age, a serious illness,

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:12.495 line:10% position:50% align:center
or some other pressure—

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.165 line:10% position:50% align:center
such a question is very understandable.

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:18.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps you’re in the position
of giving assistance

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trying to encourage a family member
or someone in the congregation 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s going through
a very difficult time right now,

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps you’ve wondered
about the same question: ‘How long?

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long do we all
have to endure all of this?’

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:40.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asking that question puts us in good company.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
To cite one example, at Psalm 13:1, 2,

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
King David asked the question, “How long?”

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
four times in quick succession.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:54.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you recall: “How long, O Jehovah,
will you forget me?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Forever?

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How long will you hide your face from me?

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:01.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How long will I have anxious concern,

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:03.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with grief in my heart each day?

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:07.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long will my enemy triumph over me?”

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:11.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
David was a human—a real person

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:15.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
with real problems and real feelings.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habakkuk was another human just like us

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was plagued with questions,

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:26.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he asked the same: “How long?”

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:29.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
How Jehovah responded to Habakkuk

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
can strengthen our resolve to wait

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:34.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
just a little while longer 

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:37.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Jehovah, to wait patiently.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bible with me

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:42.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Habakkuk chapter 1,
and let’s read verses 2 and 3.

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:46.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice the succession

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
of six emotion-filled questions

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:53.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Habakkuk 1:2, 3:

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How long, O Jehovah,

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“must I cry for help, but you do not hear?

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How long must I ask for help from violence,

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:06.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but you do not intervene?

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:09.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:11.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And why do you tolerate oppression?

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are destruction and violence before me?

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:18.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why do quarreling and conflict abound?”

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:21.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think those were good questions?

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:23.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were.

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:27.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like us, Habakkuk
was living in a very difficult time.

00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:31.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Violence, oppression, injustice were rampant.

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:35.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habakkuk was deeply distressed

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:39.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the circumstances
that he was experiencing, that he was seeing.

00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:42.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Naturally, he wanted to know
how long it would be

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
before Jehovah fulfilled
the promise he had already given

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:49.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring judgment
against that wicked system of things.

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:55.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how Jehovah responded
to his faithful prophet’s questions

00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:59.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
really can strengthen
our confidence in Jehovah.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in chapter 2 and verse 3,

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:06.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
though not obligated to answer,
what did Jehovah tell him?

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habakkuk 2:3:

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:13.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the vision
is yet for its appointed time,

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:16.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it is rushing toward its end,

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it will not lie.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even if it should delay,
keep in expectation of it!

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:25.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it will without fail come true.

00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:28.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will not be late!”

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:33.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
A beautiful reassurance from Jehovah,
wouldn’t you agree?

00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:35.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Analyze those words.

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice first that Jehovah assured Habakkuk

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
that divine judgment was coming.

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:45.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had not changed his stated purpose.

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Jehovah added that there was 

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:50.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
an “appointed [or fixed] time”
for that judgment.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, Jehovah was telling Habakkuk,

00:03:53.883 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Habakkuk, the day of judgment
is on my calendar.’

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:01.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah then added more.

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:03.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that the judgment was “rushing

00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:05.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward its end,” or its fulfillment.

00:04:05.528 --> 00:04:07.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It [would] not lie.”

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:11.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result of thinking and meditating
on those assurances,

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:16.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habakkuk had no reason to be impatient
or to give way to despair.

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:19.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, instead of criticizing Habakkuk

00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:23.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those very sincere,
very poignant questions,

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:26.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah encouraged Habakkuk:

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:28.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep in expectation of it!”

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wait eagerly for it.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will not be late!”

00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:36.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know,
it’s one thing to receive encouragement,

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:40.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m sure you’d agree
that it’s another thing to fully accept it,

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:44.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take it to heart and be nourished at heart
by such encouragement.

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:48.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Habakkuk
take Jehovah’s response to heart?

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:51.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did it encourage him?

00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:53.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, cast your eyes
to chapter 2 and verse 1,

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:57.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ll notice
that Habakkuk’s communication with Jehovah

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
did, in fact, calm his heart.

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:04.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
He resolved to keep waiting confidently

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:06.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and patiently on Jehovah.

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:09.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, in chapter 3 and verse 16,

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:12.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habakkuk repeated his resolve when he said

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:16.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would
“quietly wait” for Jehovah’s day.

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:20.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does all of this have to do
with you and with me?

00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:23.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we live at a time when Jehovah

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
has also appointed a fixed day of judgment.

00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:29.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nearly 2,000 years ago,

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Father already knew
when the end would come, according to Jesus.

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:36.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 24:36,

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:38.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
what had Jehovah already established?

00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:40.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
A “day and hour.”

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:45.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that means that the day
that you and I eagerly anticipate

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
is on Jehovah’s calendar.

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:50.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been there for a long time.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will come on time, at the right time,

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a time that Jehovah
knows to be the best time.

00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:02.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t that what we would expect
of our best Friend, Jehovah God;

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:06.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of love; the Great Timekeeper;
“the King of eternity”?

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditating on the fact
that the day and hour is established 

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us renew our resolve

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:16.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep waiting patiently on Jehovah.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if the day seems to be delaying?

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:24.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, there at Habakkuk 2:3,

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah himself
brought up the subject of a delay.

00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:30.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was Jehovah who said:

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:33.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even if it should delay,
keep in expectation of it!”

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how could the end come on time
and yet be delayed?

00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:43.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, consider the situation
back in Habakkuk’s day.

00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:45.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about 100 years earlier

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:47.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the prophet Isaiah had foretold

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would use Babylon
to bring a day of judgment.

00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:54.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you or I were in Habakkuk’s sandals,

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:57.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
how might we have felt?

00:06:57.033 --> 00:07:00.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
From our point of view
enduring that wicked system of things,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may have well seemed
that the day of Jehovah was delaying.

00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:07.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if Habakkuk felt that way,

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:10.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Jehovah’s assurances
surely comforted him.

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:13.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we noticed that Jehovah
didn’t criticize him

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
for asking, How long? How long? twice 

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:18.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, Why? four times.

00:07:18.554 --> 00:07:19.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:22.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah took into consideration

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:25.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pain of heart of his friend
and then reassured him.

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do you know what happened 20 years later?

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:31.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s words were fulfilled.

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:35.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 B.C.E.

00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:39.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
So had there really been a delay?

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:40.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:44.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
That delay was only a perceived one

00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:47.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the mind of Habakkuk.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, you and I can look back

00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:55.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the book of history
and see the bigger picture, 

00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:59.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that Habakkuk
simply could not see fully in his time.

00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:02.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do we see now
about that day of judgment

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:05.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 607 B.C.E.?

00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, like a piece
in a very detailed but beautiful puzzle,

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:13.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
the destruction of Jerusalem
came right on time

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
—at the perfect time—

00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:20.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that was a pivotal date
in the fulfillment of other Bible prophecies,

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:24.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
prophecies that have to do
with our day during the last days.

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:29.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while Habakkuk
may have thought that there was a delay,

00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:31.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knew better.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:36.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the reminder
that nourishes our heart this morning?

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:41.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything linked to Jehovah’s grand purpose

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
has always been and will always be

00:08:44.574 --> 00:08:48.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the perfect control
of the Great Timekeeper, Jehovah.

00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:54.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
In summary, we could conclude
from our Morning Worship program today

00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:58.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Habakkuk’s experience
teaches us valuable lessons.

00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:03.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
One, Jehovah is not indifferent

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:07.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the suffering and the emotional distress
of his servants.

00:09:08.264 --> 00:09:11.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
So are you in some emotional distress

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
or assisting someone else who is?

00:09:14.604 --> 00:09:18.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be afraid
to keep pouring out your heart to Jehovah,

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:22.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping others to do so,
even repeatedly if needed.

00:09:22.945 --> 00:09:26.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Habakkuk,
wait patiently for the answers,

00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:29.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
the reassurance that Jehovah will provide.

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:34.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember this too about the salvation
that Jehovah has foretold:

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
His salvation for his people
is not a temporary solution.

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:41.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a bandage on a wound.

00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:44.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
His solution will completely resolve

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:48.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
any and all trials we may be experiencing.

00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:51.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once they’re gone, they’re gone for good.

00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:54.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how reassuring it is—isn’t it?—to know

00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:56.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
that today we are one day closer

00:09:56.779 --> 00:10:00.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the fixed day
that’s on Jehovah’s calendar!

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:05.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s judgments
by means of his Kingdom will not be late.
