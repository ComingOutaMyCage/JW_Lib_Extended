00:00:01 Have you ever asked, “How long?”
00:00:04 If you’re enduring
00:00:05 some challenging circumstance right now
00:00:07 —perhaps old age, a serious illness,
00:00:10 or some other pressure—
00:00:12 such a question is very understandable.
00:00:15 Or perhaps you’re in the position of giving assistance
00:00:18 and trying to encourage a family member or someone in the congregation
00:00:23 who’s going through a very difficult time right now,
00:00:27 and perhaps you’ve wondered about the same question: ‘How long?
00:00:31 How long do we all have to endure all of this?’
00:00:36 Asking that question puts us in good company.
00:00:40 To cite one example, at Psalm 13:1, 2,
00:00:43 King David asked the question, “How long?”
00:00:46 four times in quick succession.
00:00:49 Maybe you recall: “How long, O Jehovah, will you forget me?
00:00:54 “Forever?
00:00:55 “How long will you hide your face from me?
00:00:58 “How long will I have anxious concern,
00:01:01 “with grief in my heart each day?
00:01:03 How long will my enemy triumph over me?”
00:01:08 David was a human—a real person
00:01:11 with real problems and real feelings.
00:01:16 Habakkuk was another human just like us
00:01:19 who was plagued with questions,
00:01:22 and he asked the same: “How long?”
00:01:26 How Jehovah responded to Habakkuk
00:01:29 can strengthen our resolve to wait
00:01:32 just a little while longer
00:01:34 on Jehovah, to wait patiently.
00:01:37 Please open your Bible with me
00:01:39 to Habakkuk chapter 1, and let’s read verses 2 and 3.
00:01:43 And notice the succession
00:01:46 of six emotion-filled questions
00:01:50 —Habakkuk 1:2, 3:
00:01:53 “How long, O Jehovah,
00:01:56 “must I cry for help, but you do not hear?
00:02:00 “How long must I ask for help from violence,
00:02:04 “but you do not intervene?
00:02:06 “Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?
00:02:09 “And why do you tolerate oppression?
00:02:11 “Why are destruction and violence before me?
00:02:14 And why do quarreling and conflict abound?”
00:02:19 Do you think those were good questions?
00:02:22 They were.
00:02:23 Like us, Habakkuk was living in a very difficult time.
00:02:27 Violence, oppression, injustice were rampant.
00:02:33 Habakkuk was deeply distressed
00:02:35 by the circumstances that he was experiencing, that he was seeing.
00:02:39 Naturally, he wanted to know how long it would be
00:02:42 before Jehovah fulfilled the promise he had already given
00:02:46 to bring judgment against that wicked system of things.
00:02:50 But how Jehovah responded to his faithful prophet’s questions
00:02:55 really can strengthen our confidence in Jehovah.
00:02:59 Notice in chapter 2 and verse 3,
00:03:02 though not obligated to answer, what did Jehovah tell him?
00:03:07 Habakkuk 2:3:
00:03:09 “For the vision is yet for its appointed time,
00:03:13 “and it is rushing toward its end,
00:03:16 “and it will not lie.
00:03:18 “Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it!
00:03:22 “For it will without fail come true.
00:03:25 It will not be late!”
00:03:29 A beautiful reassurance from Jehovah, wouldn’t you agree?
00:03:33 Analyze those words.
00:03:35 Notice first that Jehovah assured Habakkuk
00:03:38 that divine judgment was coming.
00:03:42 Jehovah had not changed his stated purpose.
00:03:45 And then Jehovah added that there was
00:03:47 an “appointed [or fixed] time” for that judgment.
00:03:51 In effect, Jehovah was telling Habakkuk,
00:03:53 ‘Habakkuk, the day of judgment is on my calendar.’
00:03:59 Jehovah then added more.
00:04:01 He said that the judgment was “rushing
00:04:03 toward its end,” or its fulfillment.
00:04:05 “It [would] not lie.”
00:04:07 And as a result of thinking and meditating on those assurances,
00:04:11 Habakkuk had no reason to be impatient or to give way to despair.
00:04:16 In fact, instead of criticizing Habakkuk
00:04:19 for those very sincere, very poignant questions,
00:04:23 Jehovah encouraged Habakkuk:
00:04:26 “Keep in expectation of it!”
00:04:28 Wait eagerly for it.
00:04:30 “It will not be late!”
00:04:34 Well, you know, it’s one thing to receive encouragement,
00:04:36 but I’m sure you’d agree that it’s another thing to fully accept it,
00:04:40 to take it to heart and be nourished at heart by such encouragement.
00:04:44 Did Habakkuk take Jehovah’s response to heart?
00:04:48 Did it encourage him?
00:04:51 Well, cast your eyes to chapter 2 and verse 1,
00:04:53 and you’ll notice that Habakkuk’s communication with Jehovah
00:04:57 did, in fact, calm his heart.
00:05:01 He resolved to keep waiting confidently
00:05:04 and patiently on Jehovah.
00:05:06 Later, in chapter 3 and verse 16,
00:05:09 Habakkuk repeated his resolve when he said
00:05:12 that he would “quietly wait” for Jehovah’s day.
00:05:18 Well, what does all of this have to do with you and with me?
00:05:21 Well, we live at a time when Jehovah
00:05:23 has also appointed a fixed day of judgment.
00:05:27 Nearly 2,000 years ago,
00:05:29 the Father already knew when the end would come, according to Jesus.
00:05:33 At Matthew 24:36,
00:05:36 what had Jehovah already established?
00:05:38 A “day and hour.”
00:05:41 So that means that the day that you and I eagerly anticipate
00:05:45 is on Jehovah’s calendar.
00:05:48 It’s been there for a long time.
00:05:50 It will come on time, at the right time,
00:05:53 at a time that Jehovah knows to be the best time.
00:05:58 And isn’t that what we would expect of our best Friend, Jehovah God;
00:06:02 the God of love; the Great Timekeeper; “the King of eternity”?
00:06:07 Meditating on the fact that the day and hour is established
00:06:10 helps us renew our resolve
00:06:14 to keep waiting patiently on Jehovah.
00:06:17 But what if the day seems to be delaying?
00:06:20 Interestingly, there at Habakkuk 2:3,
00:06:24 Jehovah himself brought up the subject of a delay.
00:06:28 It was Jehovah who said:
00:06:30 “Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it!”
00:06:34 Well, how could the end come on time and yet be delayed?
00:06:39 Well, consider the situation back in Habakkuk’s day.
00:06:43 It was about 100 years earlier
00:06:45 that the prophet Isaiah had foretold
00:06:47 that Jehovah would use Babylon to bring a day of judgment.
00:06:51 Now, if you or I were in Habakkuk’s sandals,
00:06:54 how might we have felt?
00:06:57 From our point of view enduring that wicked system of things,
00:07:00 it may have well seemed that the day of Jehovah was delaying.
00:07:06 And if Habakkuk felt that way,
00:07:07 then Jehovah’s assurances surely comforted him.
00:07:11 Again, we noticed that Jehovah didn’t criticize him
00:07:13 for asking, How long? How long? twice
00:07:16 and, Why? four times.
00:07:18 No.
00:07:19 Jehovah took into consideration
00:07:22 the pain of heart of his friend and then reassured him.
00:07:26 And do you know what happened 20 years later?
00:07:28 Jehovah’s words were fulfilled.
00:07:31 Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 B.C.E.
00:07:35 So had there really been a delay?
00:07:39 Not at all.
00:07:40 That delay was only a perceived one
00:07:44 in the mind of Habakkuk.
00:07:48 Of course, you and I can look back
00:07:51 through the book of history and see the bigger picture,
00:07:55 one that Habakkuk simply could not see fully in his time.
00:08:00 And what do we see now about that day of judgment
00:08:02 in 607 B.C.E.?
00:08:05 Well, like a piece in a very detailed but beautiful puzzle,
00:08:09 the destruction of Jerusalem came right on time
00:08:13 —at the perfect time—
00:08:15 because that was a pivotal date in the fulfillment of other Bible prophecies,
00:08:20 prophecies that have to do with our day during the last days.
00:08:25 So while Habakkuk may have thought that there was a delay,
00:08:29 Jehovah knew better.
00:08:32 What’s the reminder that nourishes our heart this morning?
00:08:37 Everything linked to Jehovah’s grand purpose
00:08:41 has always been and will always be
00:08:44 in the perfect control of the Great Timekeeper, Jehovah.
00:08:49 In summary, we could conclude from our Morning Worship program today
00:08:54 that Habakkuk’s experience teaches us valuable lessons.
00:08:58 One, Jehovah is not indifferent
00:09:03 to the suffering and the emotional distress of his servants.
00:09:08 So are you in some emotional distress
00:09:11 or assisting someone else who is?
00:09:14 Don’t be afraid to keep pouring out your heart to Jehovah,
00:09:18 helping others to do so, even repeatedly if needed.
00:09:22 Like Habakkuk, wait patiently for the answers,
00:09:26 the reassurance that Jehovah will provide.
00:09:29 Remember this too about the salvation that Jehovah has foretold:
00:09:34 His salvation for his people is not a temporary solution.
00:09:38 It’s not a bandage on a wound.
00:09:42 His solution will completely resolve
00:09:44 any and all trials we may be experiencing.
00:09:48 Once they’re gone, they’re gone for good.
00:09:52 So how reassuring it is—isn’t it?—to know
00:09:54 that today we are one day closer
00:09:56 to the fixed day that’s on Jehovah’s calendar!
00:10:00 Jehovah’s judgments by means of his Kingdom will not be late.
