00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:05.789 line:10% position:50% align:center
Solomon had three horrible half brothers

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.892 line:10% position:50% align:center
—Amnon,

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:12.028 line:10% position:50% align:center
Adonijah, and Absalom.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.498 line:10% position:50% align:center
They were a lot older than he was,

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:18.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Solomon didn’t try to imitate them.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:20.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he didn’t allow himself to be stumbled

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
by their bad conduct, as if to say,

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:25.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, if that’s the kind of people
they have around here,

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:28.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want nothing to do
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.’

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Solomon followed his own path.

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:35.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
He developed a strong personal relationship
with Jehovah God.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember what the Bible says
about Solomon in the beginning?

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:44.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved him.

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:46.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:49.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you love it
if that were said about you?

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:50.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved Solomon,

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed Solomon in many ways.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, while Solomon was faithful,
Israel was at peace.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:05.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Solomon said: “Jehovah my God
has given me rest [all around].

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no one opposing me

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:12.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing bad [is] happening.”

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was only
after Solomon became unfaithful

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:20.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
that resisters were raised up in Israel.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only was Israel at peace
when Solomon was at peace with God,

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:27.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Israel was rich.

00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:29.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon had no financial problems.

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:33.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that the silver
was as common as the stones.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Solomon started
drawing away from Jehovah,

00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:40.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah withdrew his blessing.

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:44.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that prosperity didn’t last
even during Solomon’s reign. 

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight</i>  tells us

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:50.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there was a drain on Israel’s economy.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon was still spending money
as if it were going out of style,

00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:57.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he didn’t have the income
that he once had.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, even materially, Israel suffered.

00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:04.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Rehoboam did not inherit
the wealth from Solomon

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Solomon had
had at the peak of his reign.

00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:11.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as our comment points out,
for much of his reign,

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:14.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon did a lot of good things.

00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:18.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is it possible
that right from the beginning,

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:22.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
as involved as Solomon
was in theocratic projects,

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a little red flag

00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:28.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
that something wasn’t quite right?

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s possible.

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:34.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as our comment points out,
when Solomon became king,

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:39.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was a young man,
but he was a young married man.

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:41.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, when he became king,

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:44.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon had probably been married
for a couple of years already.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:46.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a little boy.
He was a daddy.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a little boy—one-year-old Rehoboam.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who was his wife

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:56.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
—probably his first wife?

00:02:56.726 --> 00:03:01.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was an Ammonitess.

00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:05.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ammonitess—what do we remember
about “Ammonitess”?

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:08.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, Deuteronomy chapter 23

00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:14.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 3.

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:20.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember, when Solomon gets married,
King David is still alive.

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
David is probably at the wedding.

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:25.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s what Deuteronomy 23:3 says:

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No Ammonite

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:32.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or Moabite may come
into the congregation of Jehovah.

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:35.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even to the tenth generation,

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:37.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“none of their descendants

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:42.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
may ever come
into the congregation of Jehovah.”

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
What part of “never”
did Solomon not understand?

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:52.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so could that mean
that even before he became king,

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:57.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon had a casual view
of Jehovah’s laws on marriage?

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:59.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s possible.

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:01.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, why do we say “possible”?

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, without being dogmatic, 

00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight</i>  says that there may
have been exceptions for foreign women

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:10.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Ruth the Moabitess.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:13.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
But <i>Insight</i>  also says

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:15.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Solomon’s Ammonite wife

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:18.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
possibly contributed to his apostasy.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:22.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any event, why was the first wife

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
a foreign woman and an Ammonitess to boot?

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:31.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if Solomon
had married a nice Jewish girl

00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:34.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
(just one)

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:37.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ‘rejoiced with the wife of his youth,’

00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:40.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t you think that the history of Israel
would have been much different?

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:42.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it would have been.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:46.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s take a moment to think
about the women Solomon did marry

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:49.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
—pagan women.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:53.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you may have relatives
who are not in the truth;

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:57.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
you love your relatives,
and you go visit from time to time.

00:04:57.447 --> 00:05:01.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how long is it before you
run out of things to talk about?

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:06.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we just don’t have
the most important thing in common—the truth.

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:09.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to ask:

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:13.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was Solomon so comfortable
with these pagan women?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he talk about?

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you can be sure he wasn’t studying
<i>The Watchtower</i>  with them.

00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:21.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was he doing?

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the attraction
to these foreign women?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it their humility?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
their modest dress?

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:32.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
their “chaste conduct”?

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:35.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
their “quiet and mild spirit”?

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:38.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or was it mainly physical?

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:41.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s be blunt.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:46.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon was attracted
to the wrong kind of woman.

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:50.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there may have been early warning signs.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of “red flags,”
when Solomon began marrying many women,

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:58.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
did a prophet or a priest ever approach him

00:05:58.374 --> 00:06:00.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give him some counsel?

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:05.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they ever read Deuteronomy 17:17,
which applied directly to the king?

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 17:17

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:11.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it says about the king:

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:14.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Neither should he take
many wives for himself,

00:06:14.924 --> 00:06:19.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that his heart may not go astray.”

00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:23.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if he did receive that counsel,
he certainly didn’t apply it.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:27.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if he didn’t receive that counsel,
we wonder, ‘Why not?’

00:06:28.438 --> 00:06:30.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the application?

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we may be very busy
in Jehovah’s organization,

00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:39.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we have to be alert to any red flags

00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:43.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
that despite outward appearances,
all is not well with us.

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:47.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
A single brother is a regular publisher.

00:06:47.924 --> 00:06:50.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a regular meeting attender.

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:53.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on his nights off,
he likes to go to nightclubs,

00:06:53.863 --> 00:06:56.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s comfortable in that atmosphere.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:07:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
He isn’t shy about striking up conversations
with worldly people,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he loves to dance.

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:06.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are no sisters there,
so he dances with worldly women.

00:07:07.777 --> 00:07:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the attraction?

00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:12.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is busy in the congregation,

00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:15.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there’s something there
that isn’t quite right.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
A young pioneer brother loves to flirt.

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several young sisters think
he’s interested only in them.

00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:26.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
The attention makes them feel special.

00:07:28.164 --> 00:07:30.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
A ministerial servant

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:34.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
spends a lot of time
talking to a married woman.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was asked about it,
he justifies it and says: “We’re just friends.

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:40.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re just talking.”

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:42.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Famous last words.

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
A fine young sister is offended

00:07:45.948 --> 00:07:50.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
when an older sister approaches her
and points out that her skirts and jeans

00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:53.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
are too tight, too revealing.

00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:56.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, all of these are red flags.

00:07:57.793 --> 00:08:01.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to examine ourselves
from time to time to see whether,

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:03.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how many privileges we have,

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
something isn’t quite right.

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to choosing a mate,

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:13.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon’s example can be instructive to us.

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what qualities
do we value in a marriage mate

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:19.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
—spiritual qualities?

00:08:19.215 --> 00:08:21.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it merely the physical

00:08:21.217 --> 00:08:24.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we hope that the spiritual
will catch up later?

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
A younger sister is getting acquainted
with a young brother.

00:08:28.524 --> 00:08:31.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is really good looking
and has a great personality

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gets along with everybody.

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:35.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how is he doing spiritually?

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:40.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he have a good schedule
for theocratic activities, and does he stick to it?

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:44.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example: If you mention an article
in a recent magazine,

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
does he often say,
“I must have missed that one”?

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:51.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that’s what happens, it’s a bad sign.

00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:56.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he make spiritual activities
a priority in his life?

00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:58.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he doesn’t do that while he is single,

00:08:58.387 --> 00:09:02.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
what makes you think that he’s going
to do it after you get married?

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:07.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you change him, or will he change you?

00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:12.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our comment reminds us,
Solomon enjoyed many privileges.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he apparently felt that some of God’s laws
just didn’t apply to him.

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:18.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t know.

00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:22.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could it be what Solomon
said in Ecclesiastes:

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:24.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The king does whatever he wants’?

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:26.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe so.

00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:32.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon multiplied horses
and acquired many wives for himself.

00:09:32.054 --> 00:09:34.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the lesson for us?

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:36.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how long we’ve been in the truth,

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:39.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how many privileges we have,

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how much Jehovah has used us,

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:45.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can’t afford to let down our guard.

00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:48.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must guard our heart,

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:50.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we mustn’t ignore any red flags

00:09:50.973 --> 00:09:54.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might indicate that all is not well.
