00:00:01 Well, here is a question:
00:00:03 Do you see people as Jehovah sees them?
00:00:07 Now, that’s a very practical question
00:00:10 that comes up when we read in the Scriptures
00:00:12 that they describe Noah
00:00:15 as being “faultless among his contemporaries.”
00:00:19 Now, we all know that Noah was an imperfect human.
00:00:23 So why would the Bible make the comment
00:00:26 that Noah was “faultless”?
00:00:29 Well, if you go to Insight, Volume 2,
00:00:32 page 604, under the article “Perfection,”
00:00:36 there’s a very, very interesting discussion of this,
00:00:39 and I want to read some of it to you.
00:00:41 It says, when talking about men like Noah and Job and others, it says:
00:00:45 “It is clear that such men were ‘faultless’ and ‘blameless’
00:00:50 “in the sense of measuring up fully
00:00:54 “to God’s requirements for them,
00:00:56 requirements that took into account their imperfection and disability.”
00:01:02 Now, “even as a potter
00:01:03 “[this is the illustration the Insight  book uses, even as a potter]
00:01:07 “would not expect the same quality
00:01:10 “when molding a vase from common clay
00:01:13 “as he would when forming one
00:01:16 “from special refined clay,
00:01:19 “so Jehovah’s requirements take into consideration
00:01:22 “the weakness of imperfect humans.
00:01:26 “Though committing errors and wrongs because of their fleshly imperfection,
00:01:30 “such faithful men nevertheless manifested
00:01:33 “‘a complete heart’ toward Jehovah.
00:01:36 “Thus, within the limits possible for them to attain,
00:01:40 “their devotion was complete, sound,
00:01:43 “satisfying the divine requirements in their case.
00:01:48 “Since God the Judge was pleased with their worship,
00:01:52 “no human or spirit creature
00:01:55 could rightly find fault with [them].”
00:01:58 Isn’t that an interesting quote from the Insight  volume?
00:02:01 The June 1, 2008, Watchtower
00:02:04 just adds one more thought.
00:02:07 It says: “Notice that the Bible says he was faultless
00:02:11 “among, not from the viewpoint of, his contemporaries.
00:02:16 “In other words, he was faultless in the eyes of God,
00:02:20 “but to the people of the pre-Flood world,
00:02:23 Noah was odd.”
00:02:26 Well, that’s an interesting comment, isn’t it?
00:02:28 Well, maybe even the members of Noah’s family
00:02:31 might have had some interesting comments about Noah.
00:02:34 Maybe those were some of the questions Sister Denyse Ekrann mentioned,
00:02:37 some questions her Bible student would like to ask.
00:02:39 Maybe we’d like to ask some questions like that about Noah.
00:02:42 Did he have some annoying habits?
00:02:44 Did he snore?
00:02:47 Noah was imperfect, right?
00:02:49 But from Jehovah’s standpoint, he was “faultless.”
00:02:54 He did everything that Jehovah expected him to do,
00:02:58 given his imperfection.
00:03:01 Well, that highlights a very important truth,
00:03:04 which is that there is a difference
00:03:07 between the way that Jehovah sees people
00:03:10 and the way that we see people.
00:03:12 But it should always be our desire
00:03:15 to try to see people
00:03:18 the way that Jehovah can see them.
00:03:20 Well, now, think of some examples.
00:03:24 Let’s start with King David.
00:03:26 Now, if you had to describe David’s life course,
00:03:30 what would you say?
00:03:32 Well, would you begin by describing some of the major sins
00:03:37 that David had committed during his life?
00:03:41 See, maybe that’s our human tendency,
00:03:43 to right away think of the failure
00:03:46 that we know about David.
00:03:48 But what does 1 Kings chapter 15 say?
00:03:51 Let’s read this together —1 Kings chapter 15
00:03:58 and verse 5.
00:04:02 It says: “For David did what was right
00:04:05 “in the eyes of Jehovah,
00:04:07 “and he did not turn aside from anything
00:04:11 “that He had commanded him all the days of his life,
00:04:15 except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.”
00:04:20 Now, isn’t that an interesting description of David?
00:04:23 Probably for us, that’s a pretty big “except,” isn’t it?
00:04:27 And yet, how did Jehovah see David?
00:04:31 How did he view him?
00:04:32 Well, again, let’s look at 1 Kings chapter 11
00:04:37 and verse 4.
00:04:40 It says: “In Solomon’s old age,
00:04:43 “his wives inclined his heart to follow other gods,
00:04:47 “and his heart [now, notice this, and his heart]
00:04:51 “was not complete with Jehovah his God
00:04:54 like the heart of David his father.”
00:04:58 So from the standpoint of Jehovah,
00:05:01 David had a complete heart.
00:05:04 Now, why was that?
00:05:05 Why was it that Jehovah could see David as having a complete heart?
00:05:10 Insight, Volume 1, page 1211,
00:05:14 under the article on “Integrity,”
00:05:16 says this:
00:05:18 “David . . . committed several serious wrongs,
00:05:21 “but he, nevertheless,  ‘walked with integrity of heart,’
00:05:26 “for he accepted reproof and corrected his way.
00:05:30 “He thereby proved that his heart
00:05:33 still retained genuine love for Jehovah God.”
00:05:37 Well, whether we’re speaking about Noah
00:05:40 or we’re speaking about David,
00:05:43 Jehovah could see good in these men.
00:05:46 He could view Noah as “faultless” and David as having a complete heart.
00:05:52 Well, now, how do we view others?
00:05:54 We know how Jehovah sees people, but how do we view them?
00:05:58 Well, the human tendency is always to look
00:06:01 for flaws and imperfections
00:06:04 and then to focus on these.
00:06:07 Well, now, let me show you— Let me show you this.
00:06:10 What do you see here?
00:06:13 Well, now, there are two ways you could answer.
00:06:15 You could say a piece of paper,
00:06:17 or you could say a spot.
00:06:21 Well, our human tendency would be to answer, “I see a spot.”
00:06:25 And that’s the way we tend to look at other people.
00:06:28 We tend to immediately identify their weaknesses.
00:06:31 And by focusing on those spots, or blemishes,
00:06:36 what happens?
00:06:38 Well, often they tend to get bigger
00:06:40 and bigger and bigger
00:06:43 so that now,
00:06:45 instead of seeing the good things about our brothers,
00:06:48 we become completely focused on their negative qualities.
00:06:53 Yet, if we were to actually speak to the individual involved
00:06:58 (the actual person, maybe), how do they see themselves?
00:07:01 Well, maybe it’s sort of like this.
00:07:03 You see, they see themselves
00:07:05 as all black with just that one —one small spot—
00:07:10 maybe just one small, bright spot in their life.
00:07:14 And by focusing constantly on negatives and imperfections,
00:07:18 what’s the effect?
00:07:20 Well, we could even close out that one bright spot.
00:07:24 Brothers, what’s the solution?
00:07:27 We have to learn
00:07:29 to see people the way Jehovah sees them.
00:07:33 We have to learn from our heavenly Father
00:07:35 and work very, very hard  to be able to see them as he does.
00:07:40 That means we have to look for the good;
00:07:43 we have to emphasize the good.
00:07:45 And if we don’t see it initially or immediately,
00:07:48 then we have to work hard to get to know our brothers better
00:07:53 so that we can identify clearly their beautiful qualities
00:07:57 so we come to see them the way Jehovah does.
00:08:00 When I served in the Philippines,
00:08:03 I was deeply moved by the experience of a brother named Miguel,
00:08:08 who while preaching in a prison
00:08:10 met a man named Esmeraldo,
00:08:13 who had killed Miguel’s own grandson.
00:08:17 Now, Miguel was afraid that when he met Esmeraldo in the prison,
00:08:21 he would try to kill him.
00:08:24 So immediately when Esmeraldo approached him,
00:08:27 Miguel began to explain to him truths from the Bible.
00:08:31 Well, Esmeraldo was so moved by what he heard
00:08:36 that he admitted that he had committed the murder,
00:08:39 and he apologized to Miguel for doing so.
00:08:43 Another brother was watching this scene from a distance,
00:08:47 and he encouraged Miguel to start a Bible study with Esmeraldo.
00:08:52 The brother had no idea of the connection between the two men.
00:08:57 Well, even so, Miguel did agree
00:09:01 to study the Bible with Esmeraldo.
00:09:04 And on February 1, 2010,
00:09:07 Esmeraldo was baptized as our Christian brother.
00:09:11 Can you imagine?
00:09:12 Can you imagine how much effort it would have taken for Miguel
00:09:16 to be able to see Esmeraldo
00:09:19 in the way that Jehovah would come to see him?
00:09:21 But he was willing to make the effort.
00:09:25 Although it will never ever be easy,
00:09:27 if we can learn to see others in the way that Jehovah sees them,
00:09:32 we’ll focus on their good qualities.
00:09:35 We’ll be eager to help them to improve,
00:09:38 and we may even have the joy of being able to serve
00:09:42 our wonderful God Jehovah forever along with them.
