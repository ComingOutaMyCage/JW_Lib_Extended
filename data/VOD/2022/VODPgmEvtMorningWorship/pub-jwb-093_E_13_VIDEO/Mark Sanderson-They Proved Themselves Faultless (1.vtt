00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:02.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here is a question:

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.757 line:10% position:50% align:center
Do you see people as Jehovah sees them?

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:10.126 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a very practical question

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.929 line:10% position:50% align:center
that comes up when we read in the Scriptures

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.398 line:10% position:50% align:center
that they describe Noah

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:19.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
as being “faultless
among his contemporaries.”

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we all know
that Noah was an imperfect human.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why would the Bible make the comment

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:29.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Noah was “faultless”?

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you go to <i>Insight,</i> Volume 2,

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
page 604,
under the article “Perfection,”

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s
a very, very interesting discussion of this,

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I want to read some of it to you.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:45.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says, when talking about men
like Noah and Job and others, it says:

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:50.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is clear that such men
were ‘faultless’ and ‘blameless’

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:54.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the sense of measuring up fully

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:56.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to God’s requirements for them,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
requirements that took into account
their imperfection and disability.”

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:03.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, “even as a potter

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:07.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[this is the illustration
the <i>Insight</i>  book uses, even as a potter]

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:10.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“would not expect the same quality

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when molding a vase from common clay

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:16.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as he would when forming one

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:19.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from special refined clay,

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:22.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so Jehovah’s requirements
take into consideration

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:26.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the weakness of imperfect humans.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Though committing errors and wrongs
because of their fleshly imperfection,

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:33.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“such faithful men nevertheless manifested

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘a complete heart’ toward Jehovah.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thus, within the limits possible
for them to attain,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“their devotion was complete, sound,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“satisfying the divine requirements
in their case.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:52.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Since God the Judge was pleased
with their worship,

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:55.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“no human or spirit creature

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:58.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
could rightly find fault with [them].”

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:01.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that an interesting quote
from the <i>Insight</i>  volume?

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
The June 1, 2008, <i>Watchtower </i>

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
just adds one more thought.

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:11.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Notice that the Bible
says he was faultless

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:16.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“<i>among</i>, not from the viewpoint of,
his contemporaries.

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:20.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In other words,
he was faultless in the eyes of God,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but to the people of the pre-Flood world,

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah was odd.”

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s an interesting comment,
isn’t it?

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe even the members
of Noah’s family

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
might have had some interesting comments
about Noah.

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:37.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe those were some of the questions
Sister Denyse Ekrann mentioned,

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
some questions
her Bible student would like to ask.

00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:42.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we’d like to ask
some questions like that about Noah.

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he have some annoying habits?

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:47.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he snore?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah was imperfect, right?

00:02:49.452 --> 00:02:54.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
But from Jehovah’s standpoint,
he was “faultless.”

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:58.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did everything
that Jehovah expected him to do,

00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
given his imperfection.

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:04.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that highlights a very important truth,

00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:07.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is that there is a difference

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:10.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the way that Jehovah sees people

00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:12.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the way that we see people.

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:15.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it should always be our desire

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:18.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to see people

00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:20.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way that Jehovah can see them.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, think of some examples.

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:26.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start with King David.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:30.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you had to describe
David’s life course,

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:32.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
what would you say?

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:37.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, would you begin
by describing some of the major sins

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
that David had committed during his life?

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, maybe that’s our human tendency,

00:03:43.206 --> 00:03:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
to right away think of the failure

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we know about David.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does 1 Kings chapter 15 say?

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:56.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read this together
—1 Kings chapter 15

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:00.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 5.

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:05.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “For David did what was right

00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:07.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the eyes of Jehovah,

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:11.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he did not turn aside from anything

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:15.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that He had commanded him
all the days of his life,

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:19.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.”

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:23.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, isn’t that
an interesting description of David?

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Probably for us,
that’s a pretty big “except,” isn’t it?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, how did Jehovah see David?

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he view him?

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, again,
let’s look at 1 Kings chapter 11

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:39.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 4.

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:43.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “In Solomon’s old age,

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“his wives inclined his heart
to follow other gods,

00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:51.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and his heart
[now, notice this, and his heart]

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:54.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was not complete with Jehovah his God

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:57.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the heart of David his father.”

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
So from the standpoint of Jehovah,

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:04.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
David had a complete heart.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why was that?

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:09.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was it that Jehovah could see David
as having a complete heart? 

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight,</i> Volume 1, page 1211,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the article on “Integrity,”

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
says this:

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“David . . . committed
several serious wrongs,

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:26.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but he, nevertheless, 
‘walked with integrity of heart,’

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:30.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for he accepted reproof
and corrected his way.

00:05:30.847 --> 00:05:33.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He thereby proved that his heart

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:36.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
still retained genuine love for Jehovah God.”

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:40.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, whether we’re speaking about Noah

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we’re speaking about David,

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could see good in these men.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could view Noah as “faultless”
and David as having a complete heart.

00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:54.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, how do we view others?

00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:58.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know how Jehovah sees people,
but how do we view them?

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the human tendency is always to look

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
for flaws and imperfections

00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:07.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then to focus on these.

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:09.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, let me show you—
Let me show you this.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you see here?

00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:15.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now,
there are two ways you could answer.

00:06:15.324 --> 00:06:17.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could say a piece of paper,

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you could say a spot.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our human tendency
would be to answer, “I see a spot.”

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s the way
we tend to look at other people.

00:06:28.104 --> 00:06:31.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tend to immediately identify
their weaknesses.

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:36.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by focusing on those spots, or blemishes,

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:38.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happens?

00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, often they tend to get bigger

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bigger and bigger

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:45.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that now,

00:06:45.354 --> 00:06:48.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of seeing the good things
about our brothers,

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:53.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
we become completely focused
on their negative qualities.

00:06:53.863 --> 00:06:58.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, if we were to actually speak
to the individual involved

00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:01.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
(the actual person, maybe),
how do they see themselves?

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe it’s sort of like this.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, they see themselves

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:10.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
as all black with just that one
—one small spot—

00:07:10.646 --> 00:07:14.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe just one small, bright spot
in their life.

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:18.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by focusing constantly
on negatives and imperfections,

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s the effect?

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:24.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we could even close out
that one bright spot.

00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:27.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, what’s the solution?

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to learn

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:33.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see people the way Jehovah sees them.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:35.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to learn from our heavenly Father

00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:40.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
and work very, very hard 
to be able to see them as he does.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means we have to look for the good;

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:45.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to emphasize the good.

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:48.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we
don’t see it initially or immediately,

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we have to work hard
to get to know our brothers better

00:07:53.122 --> 00:07:57.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can identify clearly
their beautiful qualities

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we come to see them
the way Jehovah does.

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:03.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I served in the Philippines,

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:08.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was deeply moved by the experience
of a brother named Miguel,

00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:10.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
who while preaching in a prison

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
met a man named Esmeraldo,

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:17.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had killed Miguel’s own grandson.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Miguel was afraid
that when he met Esmeraldo in the prison,

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would try to kill him.

00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:27.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
So immediately when Esmeraldo approached him,

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:31.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miguel began to explain to him
truths from the Bible.

00:08:31.394 --> 00:08:36.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Esmeraldo was so moved
by what he heard

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:39.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he admitted
that he had committed the murder,

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he apologized to Miguel for doing so.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:47.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another brother
was watching this scene from a distance,

00:08:47.176 --> 00:08:52.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he encouraged Miguel
to start a Bible study with Esmeraldo.

00:08:52.181 --> 00:08:57.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother had no idea
of the connection between the two men.

00:08:57.086 --> 00:09:01.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, even so, Miguel did agree

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study the Bible with Esmeraldo.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on February 1, 2010,

00:09:07.363 --> 00:09:11.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Esmeraldo was baptized
as our Christian brother.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine?

00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:16.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine how much effort
it would have taken for Miguel

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:19.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to see Esmeraldo

00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:21.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way that Jehovah
would come to see him?

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he was willing to make the effort.

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although it will never ever be easy,

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:32.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we can learn to see others
in the way that Jehovah sees them,

00:09:32.722 --> 00:09:35.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll focus on their good qualities.

00:09:35.424 --> 00:09:38.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be eager to help them to improve,

00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:42.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we may even have the joy
of being able to serve

00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:46.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
our wonderful God Jehovah forever
along with them.
