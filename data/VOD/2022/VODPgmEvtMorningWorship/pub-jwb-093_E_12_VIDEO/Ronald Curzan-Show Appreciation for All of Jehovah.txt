00:00:01 Most of us have been attending meetings
00:00:03 for years—some for decades,
00:00:05 others for our entire life.
00:00:08 But isn’t it good to stop and pause
00:00:10 from time to time and think to ourselves
00:00:13 and ask ourselves,
00:00:14 ‘Why am I attending meetings?’
00:00:18 It seems like such a simple,
00:00:20 basic question but how profound
00:00:23 because it has huge meaning for us!
00:00:25 It really shows our motives, what’s inside, and it shows our goals.
00:00:30 It affects our relationship with Jehovah as well as others.
00:00:35 Our Watchtower  article under consideration for today is entitled
00:00:39 “Why Should We Meet Together for Worship?”
00:00:43 So there’s our clue, “for worship.”
00:00:46 And the Watchtower  article featured a box entitled
00:00:49 “Reasons to Attend Meetings.”
00:00:51 As shown on the monitor,
00:00:54 the box listed eight reasons.
00:00:56 And they were grouped into
00:00:57 three basic categories.
00:00:59 The first is how you are personally affected.
00:01:03 So we receive education at the meeting
00:01:05 and also encouragement.
00:01:07 They bring us closer to Jehovah
00:01:09 through his holy spirit,
00:01:10 and we can tap into that powerful spirit.
00:01:13 The second area is how others are affected.
00:01:16 So we have an opportunity
00:01:19 to show our brothers and sisters
00:01:20 that we love them
00:01:21 and that we want to encourage them.
00:01:23 And the last category
00:01:24 is how Jehovah is affected.
00:01:26 As we go to the meetings
00:01:28 and we have good meeting attendance,
00:01:29 it really gives us an opportunity
00:01:32 to give Jehovah what he deserves
00:01:33 —our heartfelt praise, our worship.
00:01:35 It shows Jehovah that we want
00:01:37 to draw close to him and his Son, Jesus.
00:01:40 And last, it demonstrates
00:01:41 that we support God’s sovereignty.
00:01:44 Now, this is the way The Watchtower  listed
00:01:46 these subjects, these categories.
00:01:48 But if you were to rearrange these,
00:01:50 how would you put these
00:01:52 in order of importance?
00:01:56 Isn’t it true that worshipping Jehovah
00:01:58 is the most important reason
00:02:01 why we go to the Kingdom Hall?
00:02:02 These other reasons are good.
00:02:04 We benefit; others benefit.
00:02:06 But as we meditate and we stop and think,
00:02:11 ‘Are meetings a priority in my life
00:02:15 ‘even if I’m tired, even if I’m full of anxiety,
00:02:18 or if I’m going through some difficult times?,’
00:02:20 we need to stop, think, and meditate
00:02:24 on why we go to meetings.
00:02:26 It’s to worship Jehovah.
00:02:29 And that’s exactly what the composer of Psalm 116 did.
00:02:33 He paused, he stopped,
00:02:35 and he thought about his relationship with Jehovah
00:02:38 and what he could do to serve Jehovah more in the future.
00:02:42 He saw how Jehovah helped him through the difficult times
00:02:45 as well as the good times.
00:02:48 He took this time, in Psalm 116, to reflect on all that Jehovah did for him,
00:02:53 and it’s good for us to do the same.
00:02:55 So please open your Bibles or your tablets with me to Psalm 116.
00:03:00 And as we find that psalm,
00:03:03 we will see that the psalmist
00:03:06 really tells us some wonderful things about Jehovah
00:03:10 and how we can cope with our issues.
00:03:12 We see here this psalm is referred to as “a song of gratitude.”
00:03:17 And we see this right away in verse 1,
00:03:19 where the psalmist makes this thankful saying,
00:03:24 this expression of gratitude: “I love Jehovah.”
00:03:29 Well, there are many reasons why he loved Jehovah,
00:03:31 but he starts out by saying “because he hears my voice,
00:03:35 my pleas for help”
00:03:37 and in verse 2: “He inclines his ear to me,”
00:03:39 and the footnote says: “Or [he] ‘bends down to listen.’”
00:03:44 Now, just because the psalmist had this relationship with Jehovah
00:03:48 and he loved Jehovah, it did not mean that his life was carefree,
00:03:53 that it was stress free, or that he had an easy life.
00:03:56 No, by no means.
00:03:57 In fact, it’s quite the opposite.
00:03:59 He had many problems, and he had many trials.
00:04:02 And many of us can relate
00:04:04 to some of the things that we’ll be reading in Psalm 116,
00:04:07 what this psalmist went through.
00:04:09 Notice there in verse 3,
00:04:12 it says that he faced death.
00:04:14 Well, if we were to face death, we would feel the same way as the psalmist.
00:04:18 It caused him distress; it caused him grief.
00:04:22 There in verse 6: “[He] was brought low.”
00:04:25 Well, this could mean that he felt downhearted, weak, depressed.
00:04:30 Whatever the circumstances he was in, this is how he felt.
00:04:33 In verses 10 and 11, he said: “[He] was greatly afflicted.”
00:04:38 This caused him to panic, to become anxious.
00:04:42 Now, although he was going through some difficult times and he had these trials,
00:04:46 he made a vow to Jehovah.
00:04:48 He promised in verses 2 and 4
00:04:51 to “call on” Jehovah, to give Him the praise that He deserves,
00:04:55 to rely on Him in prayer.
00:04:57 And he would do this for how long?
00:05:00 For as long as he lived.
00:05:02 And this is just what he did.
00:05:04 And as the psalmist reflected
00:05:06 on all that Jehovah had done for his loyal servants in the past
00:05:10 as well as what he had done for the psalmist himself,
00:05:13 it really helped him to come to the conclusion in verse 5
00:05:17 that the God that he worships is one who “is compassionate,”
00:05:21 one who “is . . . righteous,” one who “is merciful.”
00:05:25 And in verses 6-8, we’ll notice that Jehovah,
00:05:28 in the eyes of the psalmist, is viewed as a trusted Guardian,
00:05:32 Savior, Rescuer, a kind and compassionate Father,
00:05:37 who always provides comfort and guidance to his children.
00:05:42 And all of this —this love, this attachment to Jehovah—
00:05:46 what did it do for the psalmist?
00:05:48 Notice there in verse 10.
00:05:50 That strong love gave him strong faith.
00:05:53 It gave him the confidence to speak up and to praise his God.
00:05:58 His problems did not disappear, but neither did Jehovah.
00:06:03 Jehovah was always there to back him, to give him the comfort,
00:06:07 and to help him endure, to never give up.
00:06:11 Now, after meditating on all the ways that Jehovah cared for him over the years,
00:06:15 the psalmist asked himself a question
00:06:18 (maybe it’s a question we need to ask from time to time)
00:06:21 in verse 12:
00:06:23 “With what will I repay Jehovah
00:06:25 for all the good he has done for me [personally]?”
00:06:30 So he thought about that; he pondered.
00:06:32 And what was the conclusion?
00:06:34 Notice verse 17.
00:06:37 He said: “I will offer to you [Jehovah] the sacrifice of thanksgiving;
00:06:42 “I will call on the name of Jehovah.
00:06:45 “I will pay my vows to Jehovah in the presence of all his people,
00:06:50 “in the courtyards of the house of Jehovah,
00:06:53 “in your midst, O Jerusalem.
00:06:56 Praise Jah!”
00:06:58 So we can see the determination in the psalmist and his closeness to Jehovah.
00:07:03 Jehovah inclined his ear to listen to him, to help him.
00:07:07 Well, this really strengthened the bond
00:07:09 between the psalmist and Jehovah.
00:07:12 He was resolved to do his best to give thanks back to Jehovah
00:07:17 and live up to his promises and his vows.
00:07:20 It was his desire.
00:07:22 It was his goal to always praise Jehovah,
00:07:25 and he would do this for the rest of his life.
00:07:27 And where would he do this?
00:07:29 “In . . . the house of Jehovah.”
00:07:31 And who would he worship “in . . . the house of Jehovah” with?
00:07:34 With “all [of Jehovah’s] people.”
00:07:36 So we see a pattern for us today.
00:07:39 How can we possibly pay, or repay, Jehovah?
00:07:44 How can we show our appreciation for all the provisions,
00:07:48 all that he has done for us?
00:07:50 Well, we can never fully repay Jehovah; that’s impossible.
00:07:54 But what we can do is show him our love and our appreciation.
00:07:59 We can live up to our dedication every day.
00:08:02 We can give back to Jehovah praise every week at our meetings
00:08:06 and in the ministry and doing so
00:08:09 with our brothers and our sisters.
00:08:12 We can also show appreciation for the many provisions
00:08:15 that are available to Jehovah’s organization today,
00:08:19 like our revised Bible.
00:08:21 What a treasure that is for us!
00:08:23 And then we have the Study Bible  with all those study notes,
00:08:26 the videos, the pictures, the charts
00:08:29 —all of these helping us visual people
00:08:31 to understand what Jehovah’s righteous ways are,
00:08:35 how he wants us to act and serve him.
00:08:39 We also have the many printed publications.
00:08:42 We have jw.org, JW Broadcasting®,
00:08:46 and the beautiful music and videos
00:08:48 that are being produced for our benefit today.
00:08:52 Now, these provisions will help strengthen our love for Jehovah
00:08:56 and keep Jehovah as the number one thing in our life.
00:09:00 But to fully benefit from all of these provisions,
00:09:05 what is needed on our part?
00:09:07 Well, first of all, we need to be acquainted with what is available.
00:09:11 We need to learn how to use them.
00:09:13 And then we need to take the time, slow down,
00:09:16 and use these tools to our benefit,
00:09:19 to the worship of Jehovah, and to benefit others.
00:09:24 Now, thinking about it (just a really simple illustration),
00:09:27 many of us have a phone.
00:09:29 Some of us have these things called smartphones
00:09:31 (you need to be smart to even use these smartphones).
00:09:34 But it takes time; it takes effort to learn all the different features on these phones.
00:09:39 They can take pictures and videos.
00:09:41 We can study on these.
00:09:42 We can go on the Internet, and we can do all kinds of wonderful things.
00:09:46 We could talk to our families
00:09:48 through Skype or different means.
00:09:51 We can talk (use it as a phone).
00:09:53 How amazing!
00:09:57 But with all these things, what is needed on our part?
00:10:00 First of all, we need to understand how to use it, right?
00:10:04 And this phone or some of these tablets would never work
00:10:08 if we would not plug it into a power source.
00:10:12 It has to be charged in order to be useful to us.
00:10:16 And isn’t that the same when we think about what we need to do for Jehovah?
00:10:20 We need to be at the meetings.
00:10:22 We need to understand what he wants us to do
00:10:25 to work in accord with his will, his purposes.
00:10:27 But we also need to plug ourselves into his powerful holy spirit.
00:10:31 And if we do that, we will be able to give Jehovah the worship he deserves,
00:10:36 we will benefit, and then we will be beneficial to others.
