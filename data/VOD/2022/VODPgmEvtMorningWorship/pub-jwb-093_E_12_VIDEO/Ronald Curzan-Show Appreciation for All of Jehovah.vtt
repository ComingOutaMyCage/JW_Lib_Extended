00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:03.086 line:10% position:50% align:center
Most of us have been attending meetings

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:05.755 line:10% position:50% align:center
for years—some for decades,

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:08.491 line:10% position:50% align:center
others for our entire life.

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:10.960 line:10% position:50% align:center
But isn’t it good to stop and pause

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.129 line:10% position:50% align:center
from time to time and think to ourselves

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.731 line:10% position:50% align:center
and ask ourselves,

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why am I attending meetings?’

00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:20.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems like such a simple,

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:23.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
basic question but how profound

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it has huge meaning for us!

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:30.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really shows our motives,
what’s inside, and it shows our goals.

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:35.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
It affects our relationship with Jehovah
as well as others.

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:39.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our <i>Watchtower</i>  article
under consideration for today is entitled

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:43.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why Should We Meet Together for Worship?”

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:46.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s our clue, “for worship.”

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:49.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Watchtower</i>  article
featured a box entitled

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reasons to Attend Meetings.”

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
As shown on the monitor,

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
the box listed eight reasons.

00:00:56.372 --> 00:00:57.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were grouped into

00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:59.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
three basic categories.

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:03.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is how you are personally affected.

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:05.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we receive education at the meeting

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:07.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also encouragement.

00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
They bring us closer to Jehovah

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his holy spirit,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can tap into that powerful spirit.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second area is how others are affected.

00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:19.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have an opportunity

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:20.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show our brothers and sisters

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we love them

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:23.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we want to encourage them.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the last category

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
is how Jehovah is affected.

00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:28.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we go to the meetings

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:29.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have good meeting attendance,

00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:32.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really gives us an opportunity

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give Jehovah what he deserves

00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:35.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our heartfelt praise, our worship.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:37.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows Jehovah that we want

00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:40.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
to draw close to him and his Son, Jesus.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
And last, it demonstrates

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:44.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we support God’s sovereignty.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is the way <i>The Watchtower</i>  listed

00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:48.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
these subjects, these categories.

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:50.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you were to rearrange these,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
how would you put these

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order of importance?

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:58.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it true that worshipping Jehovah

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the most important reason

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
why we go to the Kingdom Hall?

00:02:02.672 --> 00:02:04.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
These other reasons are good.

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
We benefit; others benefit.

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:10.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we meditate and we stop and think,

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:15.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Are meetings a priority in my life

00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:18.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘even if I’m tired, even if I’m full of anxiety,

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:20.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if I’m going through some difficult times?,’

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to stop, think, and meditate

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
on why we go to meetings.

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s to worship Jehovah.

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:33.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly
what the composer of Psalm 116 did.

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:35.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
He paused, he stopped,

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he thought
about his relationship with Jehovah

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:42.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what he could do
to serve Jehovah more in the future.

00:02:42.312 --> 00:02:45.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw how Jehovah
helped him through the difficult times

00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as the good times.

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:53.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took this time, in Psalm 116,
to reflect on all that Jehovah did for him,

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:55.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s good for us to do the same.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:03:00.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please open your Bibles
or your tablets with me to Psalm 116.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we find that psalm,

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will see that the psalmist

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
really tells us
some wonderful things about Jehovah

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:12.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can cope with our issues.

00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:17.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see here this psalm
is referred to as “a song of gratitude.”

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we see this right away in verse 1,

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:24.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the psalmist
makes this thankful saying,

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:29.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
this expression of gratitude:
“I love Jehovah.”

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:31.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are many reasons
why he loved Jehovah,

00:03:31.227 --> 00:03:35.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he starts out by saying
“because he hears my voice,

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:37.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
my pleas for help”

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:39.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in verse 2:
“He inclines his ear to me,”

00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:44.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the footnote says:
“Or [he] ‘bends down to listen.’”

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:48.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just because the psalmist
had this relationship with Jehovah

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:53.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he loved Jehovah,
it did not mean that his life was carefree,

00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:56.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was stress free,
or that he had an easy life.

00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:57.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, by no means.

00:03:57.887 --> 00:03:59.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had many problems,
and he had many trials.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many of us can relate

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
to some of the things
that we’ll be reading in Psalm 116,

00:04:07.864 --> 00:04:09.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
what this psalmist went through.

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:11.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice there in verse 3,

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says that he faced death.

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we were to face death,
we would feel the same way as the psalmist.

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:22.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
It caused him distress; it caused him grief.

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:25.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
There in verse 6:
“[He] was brought low.”

00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:30.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this could mean that he felt
downhearted, weak, depressed.

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever the circumstances he was in,
this is how he felt.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verses 10 and 11, he said:
“[He] was greatly afflicted.”

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
This caused him to panic,
to become anxious.

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:46.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, although he was going through
some difficult times and he had these trials,

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
he made a vow to Jehovah.

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:51.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
He promised in verses 2 and 4

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “call on” Jehovah,
to give Him the praise that He deserves,

00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rely on Him in prayer.

00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:00.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he would do this for how long?

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:02.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
For as long as he lived.

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:04.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is just what he did.

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:06.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the psalmist reflected

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:10.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
on all that Jehovah had done
for his loyal servants in the past

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as what he had done
for the psalmist himself,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really helped him
to come to the conclusion in verse 5

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the God that he worships
is one who “is compassionate,”

00:05:21.137 --> 00:05:25.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
one who “is . . . righteous,”
one who “is merciful.”

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:28.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in verses 6-8,
we’ll notice that Jehovah,

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the eyes of the psalmist,
is viewed as a trusted Guardian,

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:37.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Savior, Rescuer,
a kind and compassionate Father,

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:42.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
who always provides
comfort and guidance to his children.

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:46.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of this
—this love, this attachment to Jehovah—

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did it do for the psalmist?

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:50.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice there in verse 10.

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:53.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
That strong love gave him strong faith.

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:57.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gave him the confidence
to speak up and to praise his God.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:03.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
His problems did not disappear,
but neither did Jehovah.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was always there to back him,
to give him the comfort,

00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:10.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to help him endure,
to never give up.

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:15.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, after meditating on all the ways
that Jehovah cared for him over the years,

00:06:15.892 --> 00:06:18.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
the psalmist asked himself a question

00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:21.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
(maybe it’s a question
we need to ask from time to time)

00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:23.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 12:

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With what will I repay Jehovah

00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:30.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all the good
he has done for me [personally]?”

00:06:30.573 --> 00:06:32.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he thought about that; he pondered.

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:34.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what was the conclusion?

00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:37.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice verse 17.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I will offer to you [Jehovah]
the sacrifice of thanksgiving;

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will call on the name of Jehovah.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:50.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will pay my vows to Jehovah
in the presence of all his people,

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:53.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the courtyards of the house of Jehovah,

00:06:53.196 --> 00:06:56.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in your midst, O Jerusalem.

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Praise Jah!”

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:03.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can see the determination
in the psalmist and his closeness to Jehovah.

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:07.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah inclined his ear to listen to him,
to help him.

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this really strengthened the bond

00:07:09.946 --> 00:07:12.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the psalmist and Jehovah.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:17.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was resolved to do his best
to give thanks back to Jehovah

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:20.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and live up to his promises and his vows.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was his desire.

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:25.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was his goal to always praise Jehovah,

00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:27.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would do this for the rest of his life.

00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:29.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
And where would he do this?

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:31.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In . . . the house of Jehovah.”

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:34.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who would he worship
“in . . . the house of Jehovah” with?

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
With “all [of Jehovah’s] people.”

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:38.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we see a pattern for us today.

00:07:39.642 --> 00:07:44.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we possibly pay, or repay, Jehovah?

00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:48.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we show
our appreciation for all the provisions,

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:50.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
all that he has done for us?

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can never fully repay Jehovah;
that’s impossible.

00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:59.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what we can do
is show him our love and our appreciation.

00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:02.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can live up to our dedication every day.

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:06.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can give back to Jehovah
praise every week at our meetings

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the ministry and doing so

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:11.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers and our sisters.

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:15.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also show
appreciation for the many provisions

00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:19.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are available
to Jehovah’s organization today,

00:08:19.148 --> 00:08:21.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
like our revised Bible.

00:08:21.184 --> 00:08:23.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a treasure that is for us!

00:08:23.386 --> 00:08:26.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we have
the <i>Study Bible </i> with all those study notes,

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:29.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
the videos, the pictures, the charts

00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:31.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of these helping us visual people

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:35.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand
what Jehovah’s righteous ways are,

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:39.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he wants us to act and serve him.

00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:42.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also have the many printed publications.

00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have jw.org, JW Broadcasting®,

00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:48.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the beautiful music and videos

00:08:48.644 --> 00:08:52.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are being produced for our benefit today.

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:56.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these provisions
will help strengthen our love for Jehovah

00:08:56.319 --> 00:09:00.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep Jehovah
as the number one thing in our life.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to fully benefit
from all of these provisions,

00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is needed on our part?

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all, we need
to be acquainted with what is available.

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:13.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to learn how to use them.

00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:16.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we need to take the time, slow down,

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and use these tools to our benefit,

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:23.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the worship of Jehovah,
and to benefit others.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, thinking about it
(just a really simple illustration),

00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:29.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of us have a phone.

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of us have
these things called smartphones

00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
(you need to be smart
to even use these smartphones).

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:39.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it takes time; it takes effort to learn
all the different features on these phones.

00:09:39.262 --> 00:09:41.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can take pictures and videos.

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can study on these.

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:46.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can go on the Internet,
and we can do all kinds of wonderful things.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could talk to our families

00:09:48.804 --> 00:09:51.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
through Skype or different means.

00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:53.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can talk (use it as a phone).

00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:56.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
How amazing!

00:09:57.647 --> 00:10:00.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with all these things,
what is needed on our part?

00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:04.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all,
we need to understand how to use it, right?

00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:08.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this phone
or some of these tablets would never work

00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:12.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we would not plug it into a power source.

00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to be charged
in order to be useful to us.

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:20.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t that the same when we
think about what we need to do for Jehovah?

00:10:20.836 --> 00:10:22.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to be at the meetings.

00:10:22.505 --> 00:10:25.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to understand what he wants us to do

00:10:25.007 --> 00:10:27.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work in accord with his will,
his purposes.

00:10:27.777 --> 00:10:31.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also need to plug ourselves
into his powerful holy spirit.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:36.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we do that, we will be able to give
Jehovah the worship he deserves,

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:40.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will benefit,
and then we will be beneficial to others.
