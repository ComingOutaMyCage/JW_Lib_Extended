00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:03.153 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve got the text:

00:00:03.153 --> 00:00:05.155 line:10% position:50% align:center
“I was given a thorn in the flesh.”

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.758 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re going to talk a little bit about that.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
So you think or you may say:

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:15.699 line:10% position:50% align:center
‘I know what it means

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to have a thorn in the flesh.

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:19.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I feel it.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:21.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It hurts.

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s like stepping on a sharp needle
with your bare foot.

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:30.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
It hurts.’

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a question:

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:39.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is a (that is one) needle in your foot
that bad?

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just one needle

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I’d bet it hurts.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And see that picture up there?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
See a little blood coming out?

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looks like he’s getting ready to slap it,

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:57.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I don’t think he’d do that.

00:00:57.874 --> 00:00:59.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I bet it hurts.

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:02.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s more than just a sting.

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:08.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just one “thorn in the flesh” hurts.

00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:13.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suppose that’s all you have

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:17.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one thorn in the flesh.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:20.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what can hurt worse?

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:23.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take a look.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at all those thorns

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:30.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
all over the man’s body!

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’m going to tell you
a little bit about this man.

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:40.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
This man fell into a pile of thorns

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:44.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
—thorny, barberry branches.

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:46.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when he tried to get up,

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:49.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
he fainted from pain

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
because thousands of needlelike thorns

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:56.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
were in his flesh.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for the following six years,

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:02.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
both he and his doctors

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:05.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
picked barbs from his body,

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
totaling 32,131 thorns.

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:13.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phew!

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:15.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
That hurts.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what did I hear you say
about your one needle?

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:25.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you say:
“But it’s hard to take, Brother Herd!

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:29.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It hurts, and it’s perplexing!

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s getting me down!”

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:35.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, can you still walk?

00:02:35.772 --> 00:02:37.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you move about?

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:44.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul didn’t let his needle, whatever it was,
get him down.

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:46.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had to live with it.

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with Jehovah’s help,

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:52.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
you too will be able
to handle the discomfort.

00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:59.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you can,
take a look at what the Bible says,

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:02.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
something that Paul wrote

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
—2 Corinthians 4:8, 9.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what he said:

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are hard-pressed in every way,

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but not cramped beyond movement;

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we are perplexed

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:21.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[I want you to concentrate
on that word “perplexed”],

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but not absolutely with no way out;

00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:28.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we are persecuted, but not abandoned;

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:32.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are knocked down, but not destroyed.”

00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:37.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about it.
When did you get your thorn?

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it before your dedication and baptism?

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:47.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before you were baptized,
you prayed earnestly

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the depths of your heart to Jehovah
for forgiveness.

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:56.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you must accept
his merciful forgiveness.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:01.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it still hurts from time to time.

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:04.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul didn’t say that it wouldn’t.

00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:06.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you were “knocked down”

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:09.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not trampled on “beyond movement.”

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
So what do we say?
We say: “Stand up!

00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:16.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Get off the ground!

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Get on your feet!

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:22.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Move forward toward the new world

00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s just around the corner.”

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s something to think about:
Think about King David.

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:34.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
He got another man’s wife pregnant,
and then he tried to hide it.

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he couldn’t.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he had him killed.

00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:43.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he repented from the heart,
and Jehovah forgave him.

00:04:45.234 --> 00:04:47.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
He found solace.

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:49.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jehovah did not eliminate

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:53.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
the painful consequences of his sin.

00:04:53.843 --> 00:04:56.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
The effects were to continue with David

00:04:56.312 --> 00:05:00.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the rest of his sinful, imperfect life.

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:08.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think of when you see
a beautiful little hummingbird?

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:13.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that something?

00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:19.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
What comes to my mind when I see one?

00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:21.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me, at the age of 12 or 13,

00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:24.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
walking in the woods near my house.

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:29.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon seeing a hummingbird
on a limb of a tree,

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
I took my slingshot and pebble

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:37.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and knocked it out of the tree,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
stone dead.

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:44.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t in the truth at the time.

00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:48.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
I killed a beautiful little bird.

00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:49.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
For what reason?

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:51.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t eat it.

00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe to prove to myself
that I was a dead shot with my slingshot.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created the colorful little bird
to bring delight to the eye.

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:09.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a sad experience.

00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s mine, not yours.

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you have one, a sad experience?

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:20.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some painful experiences
may not quickly leave the brain

00:06:20.563 --> 00:06:25.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
after repentance and God’s forgiveness.

00:06:25.234 --> 00:06:29.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what do we say?
We say: “Don’t dwell on them.

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:32.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t keep them before your eyes
all the time.

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:37.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Push them aside
by thinking about good things.”

00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:42.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not open the door to your brain and mind

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let the good things come in?

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:50.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply put,
put a bandage on your thorn

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:52.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little while longer.

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:56.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will pluck it out very soon now,

00:06:56.732 --> 00:07:00.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the pain will be long gone forever.

00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:03.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember this verse?

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may have been one of the first verses

00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you took to memory,
put to memory,

00:07:08.978 --> 00:07:11.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
and used in the field.

00:07:11.114 --> 00:07:13.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where is it?
Well, it’s Revelation 21:4.

00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:19.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I used to get out going door to door,
I still used that scripture a lot.

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:24.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here it says: “And he will wipe out
every tear from their eyes,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and death will be no more,

00:07:26.762 --> 00:07:30.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“neither will mourning nor outcry
nor pain be anymore.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:34.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
The former things have passed away.”

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when that happens,

00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can say goodbye forever.

00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:47.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
This kind of pain will never return.

00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Bye-bye, pain

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:53.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—out of sight and felt no more.

00:07:56.125 --> 00:08:01.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the tree or bush producing the thorns

00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:04.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been uprooted

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:08.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and presently is nonproductive.

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:10.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank Jehovah!”
