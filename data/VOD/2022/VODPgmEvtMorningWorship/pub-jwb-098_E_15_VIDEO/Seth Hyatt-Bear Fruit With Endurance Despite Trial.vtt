The Mediterranean region is well-known

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:10.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
for its beautiful olive groves

00:00:10.193 --> 00:00:14.864 line:10% position:50% align:center
and delicious olive oil.

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:17.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the oldest olive trees are found

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Greece and in the Middle East.

00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s thought that some of the trees

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:26.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
are thousands of years old,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet they continue to “bear fruit,”

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they endure.

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:39.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
They endure

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
epidemic disease,

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
they endure drought,

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
they endure abuse

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:52.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even neglect,

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:55.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they “bear fruit.”

00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:59.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s one thing that is required

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:03.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an olive tree to produce fruit

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
—water.

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:10.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
In years of drought,
olive trees don’t produce fruit.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we learn from the olive tree,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how does that relate to today’s text?

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:21.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Luke chapter 8,

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 15 in its entirety.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, Jesus concludes his discussion

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:37.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the man who sowed seed
that fell on different types of soil.

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As for that on the fine soil,

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“these are the ones who,

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:49.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after hearing the word
with a fine and good heart,

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:51.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
[number one] retain it.”

00:01:51.628 --> 00:01:53.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
They ‘retain the word,’

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, number two, they “bear fruit

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
with endurance.”

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:03.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re glad Luke included that detail

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
that neither Mark nor Matthew
included in their accounts.

00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:12.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bearing fruit as faithful disciples of Christ

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:15.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
would require endurance.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:19.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is the key to endurance?

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the answer is in the verse.

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see it?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
By ‘retaining the word,’

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:30.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
we “bear fruit with endurance.”

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:36.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, like the olive tree,
you and I want to be fruitful.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:39.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the olive tree,
you and I will experience hardships,

00:02:39.976 --> 00:02:42.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
challenges, disappointments,

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:44.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
and discouragement at times.

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how is it
that we “bear fruit with endurance”?

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:52.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
By having a heart attachment

00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:55.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s Word.

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:58.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to read it every day

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:00.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meditate on it

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:02.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
—digest it spiritually.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:08.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the hope that we share with others

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the same hope that sustains us

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:15.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthens our determination

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:20.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue faithful
in the work Jehovah has given us to do.

00:03:21.918 --> 00:03:25.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>
from which today’s text is drawn,

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:27.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
discussed one challenge

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
—unresponsive territory.

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
And certainly, that can be a challenge.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t help but think
of Brother Georg Lindal.

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lindal

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
lived in Canada when he learned the truth,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and shortly after his baptism,
he began to pioneer.

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:52.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Lindal had a skill.

00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:56.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could speak Icelandic.

00:03:56.586 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he decided to move to Iceland.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did that in 1929 at the age of 40.

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:07.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, little did he know

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:10.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much endurance would be required

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stick to his assignment.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
For 18 years

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:18.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was the only Witness in Iceland.

00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:23.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during those years,
not one person to whom he preached

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:26.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
took a stand for the truth.

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in 1936,

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:30.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
after he had been there for seven years,

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:35.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
he commented that he had placed
tens of thousands of books,

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet not one person responded.

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:43.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said,
‘Some have taken a stand against the truth,

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the majority continue to be indifferent.’

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:51.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would such an assignment
call for endurance?

00:04:51.741 --> 00:04:54.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:59.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Lindal
did endure faithfully in that assignment.

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:01.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there are other challenges

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can make bearing witness difficult.

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:10.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we have brothers and sisters in the world

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:13.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are facing persecution

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:15.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restrictions on the work.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:19.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in some places, the work is banned,

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet they continue

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:24.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “bear fruit with endurance.”

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:27.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought of Brother Harold King

00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:31.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
who, along with his
missionary partner Stanley Jones,

00:05:31.047 --> 00:05:34.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
served in China during the 1950’s

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and early 1960’s.

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1958, Brother King was sentenced

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:44.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
to five years of solitary confinement.

00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:47.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that would be,

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:52.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seems, a recipe
for a long period of loneliness

00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:55.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and possible discouragement.

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:57.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did Brother King address it?

00:05:57.407 --> 00:05:59.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he approach it?

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what sustained him?

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it was the reservoir

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:08.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had built up of Bible knowledge.

00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:12.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just like his partner, Brother Jones,

00:06:12.588 --> 00:06:17.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother King remembered
as many Bible verses as he could.

00:06:17.427 --> 00:06:21.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he drew on that reservoir
to sustain himself spiritually

00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:24.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
during his years of imprisonment.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might think of the brother
featured in the Sunday morning symposium

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our regional convention program

00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:34.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was able to write down 500 Bible verses.

00:06:36.913 --> 00:06:38.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many could we write

00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:42.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we found ourselves in that situation?

00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:46.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
It emphasizes the importance
of building up a reservoir. 

00:06:46.923 --> 00:06:50.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> asked
this interesting question:

00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:55.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If the two brothers, King and Jones,

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:58.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘had failed to make a serious and diligent
study of the Bible

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘before their arrest,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
what would have sustained them spiritually?’

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:08.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s a good reminder for us.

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:12.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the verses that Brother King recalled

00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:16.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
also helped him to “bear fruit,” in a way.

00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:18.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
In solitary confinement,

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:21.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still went out in the ministry
in the mornings,

00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:24.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
talking to imaginary people.

00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:27.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, he met Mrs. Carter

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:32.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
who, after a series of return visits,
agreed to a Bible study.

00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:34.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the course of his ministry,

00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother King says that he spoke out loud.

00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:39.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:42.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that he could hear with his ears

00:07:42.345 --> 00:07:46.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
the hope that he was sharing
with his imaginary audience,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s Word sustained him.

00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:53.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we ‘retain the word,’

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:57.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we “bear fruit with endurance.”

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s one other thing that we are enduring

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a pandemic.

00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:08.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And would you agree
that it calls for endurance

00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:11.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways that we haven’t experienced before?

00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:14.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in our ministry,

00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:17.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve been forced to consider
avenues of witnessing

00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:21.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we might not have been
attracted to before.

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:28.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
A circuit overseer’s wife shared
some interesting comments in that connection.

00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:31.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said: “We’re having
some of the best experiences

00:08:31.227 --> 00:08:33.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through telephone witnessing.

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:37.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have to say, it was
somewhat intimidating when we started.

00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:42.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But it is so obvious
how Jehovah is blessing this work.

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:47.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the congregations,
Bible studies have almost doubled,

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:50.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we have more return visits
than we can handle.

00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:52.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is so wonderful.”

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:56.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it is wonderful
because Jehovah is blessing the work,

00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:58.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is enabling us

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep bearing fruit with endurance.

00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:09.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his letter, James said
that we should ‘consider it all joy,

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:11.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when we meet with various trials,

00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:16.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘knowing as we do
that the tested quality of our faith

00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:18.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
works out endurance.’

00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:20.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
But James continues:

00:09:20.843 --> 00:09:23.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Allow endurance to complete its work.’

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:24.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:09:24.914 --> 00:09:29.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So that you and I will be
complete and sound in all respects,

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:32.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
not lacking in anything.’

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:34.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is our determination, isn’t it?

00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:36.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never seek to escape a trial

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:39.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
by some unscriptural means.

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we’re determined to “retain” God’s Word

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to “bear fruit.”

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
As one of our Kingdom songs so well states:

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will not give up
nor see the need for doubt or fear.

00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:56.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faithfully we’ll serve
until Jehovah’s day is here.

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:59.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let’s keep on enduring.

00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:02.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
That time is very near.”

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:06.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you and I are determined
to be amongst those

00:10:06.422 --> 00:10:09.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will “retain” God’s Word

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:12.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “bear fruit with endurance.”
