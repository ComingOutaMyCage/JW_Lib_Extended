Our family and friends are precious to us.

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:10.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
They show us love.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are there when we need them.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we lose a loved one in death,

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:23.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want comfort
from someone who understands.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:29.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
God and his Son, Jesus, understand.

00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:32.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
While on earth,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus experienced the pain
of losing family and friends.

00:00:38.623 --> 00:00:41.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the death
of a close friend named Lazarus,

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:44.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ grief was intense.

00:00:45.213 --> 00:00:47.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felt what others felt.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
The pain was crushing.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, his empathy

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
moved him to comfort others.

00:00:56.849 --> 00:01:01.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, he wanted to do more.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus spoke with his Father
and brought his friend back to life.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God and Jesus have not changed.

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:14.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
They feel pain when people die.

00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:17.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
They feel your pain

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have promised to eliminate death.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[God] will swallow up death forever . . .

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will wipe away the tears

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all faces.”

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:32.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus also gave
this beautiful promise for the future.

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:36.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be amazed at this,

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:37.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the hour is coming

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:40.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in which all those in the memorial tombs

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
will hear his voice and come out.”
