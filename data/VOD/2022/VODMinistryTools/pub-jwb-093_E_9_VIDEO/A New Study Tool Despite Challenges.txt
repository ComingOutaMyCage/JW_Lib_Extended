00:00:03 Everything about Enjoy Life Forever!
00:00:04 is different from any other publication
00:00:06 we’ve produced in the past.
00:00:07 And from the start of the project,
00:00:09 two things were critical:
00:00:10 good communication and good documentation.
00:00:13 But honestly, time and again,
00:00:14 the thing that proved to be the most important
00:00:16 was reliance on Jehovah.
00:00:17 The Writing Committee’s goal was to create
00:00:19 a first-class digital experience
00:00:22 that would engage Bible students.
00:00:25 The digital design system had to be completely remodeled
00:00:29 so that Enjoy Life Forever!  would look uniform
00:00:30 whether it’s viewed in JW Library®,
00:00:32 on jw.org, or in print.
00:00:35 Right from the inception of this project,
00:00:37 the brothers looked for input
00:00:38 so that the study material would be
00:00:40 easily available in as many languages as possible.
00:00:43 And for that reason, a team from Translation Services
00:00:46 worked along with the writers.
00:00:48 A publication of this size would usually take
00:00:51 about two or three years to complete,
00:00:53 but the Writing Committee
00:00:54 was really interested in getting the Enjoy Life Forever!  book
00:00:57 out there as soon as possible.
00:00:58 The Enjoy Life Forever!  book
00:01:00 required an intense amount of collaboration.
00:01:02 Right from the beginning,
00:01:03 the Writing Committee
00:01:04 got all six departments together
00:01:06 so we could work unitedly through the production.
00:01:42 Our existing tool set didn’t have the ability
00:01:45 to style digital publications like we can with print.
00:01:48 We could do black text on a white background with gray boxes.
00:01:52 That was the extent of the functionality that we had available.
00:01:56 Enjoy Life Forever!  is very interactive for the student.
00:01:59 When producing the audio for this publication,
00:02:01 we endeavored to maintain that feel.
00:02:04 So we added multiple voices, musical cues
00:02:07 and, in some cases, the audio track for the video
00:02:10 was reedited to teach the point effectively.
00:02:13 When we got to Lesson 32,
00:02:15 we felt that it might be too complicated
00:02:17 to build as a digital experience,
00:02:19 but that’s when the collaboration really paid off.
00:02:22 It took every tool that we had
00:02:24 and basically every trick in order to build
00:02:27 the digital version of that lesson.
00:02:29 As we were working on the prototype,
00:02:31 we would collaborate with the User Experience Group
00:02:33 to make sure that the look and feel of the digital edition
00:02:36 was the same whether it was on a large device
00:02:38 or a small device.
00:02:40 The entire chart is a visual aid.
00:02:42 So we wanted to be sure that all of our users,
00:02:44 especially those who are visually impaired,
00:02:46 would be able to understand the teaching point.
00:02:49 This required us to build the chart
00:02:51 so that screen readers could read the text
00:02:54 and that each picture would have a description for those who needed it.
00:02:58 Early in the concept stage, we understood that there would be
00:03:01 about 200 videos in this publication,
00:03:03 requiring thousands of hours of work:
00:03:05 eight brand new videos
00:03:07 and of the remaining videos, around 60 would need to be edited.
00:03:11 Just as eight new videos were entering their production phase,
00:03:14 COVID-19 hit, effectively halting
00:03:16 video production around the world.
00:03:18 This work stoppage continued until each branch could determine
00:03:22 how they could film safely
00:03:25 and still meet the deadline only nine months away.
00:03:28 Because of the pandemic, photo sessions here at headquarters
00:03:30 were completely stopped for four months.
00:03:32 Now, as things progressed, we were able to resume photography,
00:03:36 only by adhering to strict protocols.
00:03:39 For example, we had a family photograph themselves
00:03:41 while being directed by the Art Department here.
00:03:44 So everything that a Bible study conductor had been trained to do
00:03:47 —ask all the important questions,
00:03:49 develop love for Jehovah in their Bible students, show videos—
00:03:52 it’s all built into the publication.
00:03:55 So would the concept work with actual Bible students?
00:03:58 To find out, we did in-house testing.
00:04:00 And then at the same time,
00:04:02 we sent out the lessons around the world to publishers, pioneers,
00:04:05 missionaries, and circuit overseers.
00:04:07 And they used the lessons with actual Bible students.
00:04:10 We tested every lesson of the book this way.
00:04:12 And then the responses that we got back were analyzed,
00:04:15 and we made further refinements.
00:04:17 We had hundreds of team meetings, and we felt Jehovah’s holy spirit
00:04:20 equipping all of us after we opened a meeting with prayer.
00:04:23 When you collaborate, you get a better product.
00:04:26 It’s more direct, simpler, and easier to understand.
00:04:30 Also, thinking ahead
00:04:32 about potential translation problems and addressing them
00:04:34 helped expedite translation in hundreds of languages.
00:04:53 I feel that Jehovah helped us
00:04:55 accomplish this job in a shorter amount of time
00:04:57 and a quality that would have been very difficult
00:04:59 even under normal circumstances.
00:05:01 How amazing Jehovah is!
