00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Energy is essential to life on earth.

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:21.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living things must acquire energy

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and manage it properly.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
This enables creatures
to live in extreme climates,

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:33.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
move with speed,

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:36.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
and travel vast distances.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
The wandering albatross

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:45.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
flies thousands of kilometers to find food,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it can stay up in the air
for days at a time,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
rarely flapping its wings.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
It rides the wind like a rollercoaster,

00:00:57.912 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
diving toward the water,

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
turning,

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
rising in repeated arcs.

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
This efficient use of the wind’s energy

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
is known as dynamic soaring.

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:16.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
The albatross has the longest wingspan

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.599 line:10% position:50% align:center
of any bird,

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.436 line:10% position:50% align:center
about 3.5 meters, or over 11 feet.

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has a special tendon for each shoulder,

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
enabling it
to lock its wings in place at will,

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
like an airplane’s fixed wings.

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of this,

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t tire out
from keeping those long wings extended

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:44.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can continue that pattern
virtually without end.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:51.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other birds carefully conserve energy

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:53.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay warm in cold conditions.

00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:57.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stand and walk on ice

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
for extended periods of time
without freezing.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
As their blood circulates,

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
energy is transferred through a process

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
known as countercurrent heat exchange.

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:16.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a warm fluid runs in the same direction

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
alongside a cool fluid,

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
at best, 50 percent of the heat

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
is transmitted.

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if the fluids run in opposite directions,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
nearly all of the heat is transmitted.

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:36.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
The veins and arteries
in the legs of seagulls, geese, and penguins

00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:38.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
act this way.

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:41.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
This highly efficient system

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
maintains the body’s core temperature

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
while leaving
just enough heat in the bird’s feet

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep them from freezing.

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:55.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about creatures
facing the opposite extreme?

00:02:56.238 --> 00:03:00.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if instead of conserving energy
they need to lose some?

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:05.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Silver ants of the Sahara Desert

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:08.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
live in one of the hottest places on earth.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:12.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
They forage for food
when temperatures on the desert floor

00:03:12.838 --> 00:03:16.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
are as high as 70 degrees Celsius,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 158 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:25.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
To survive,
they reflect and dissipate energy.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
The secret is its hair.

00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:33.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
While some animals rely on hair to keep warm,

00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:37.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
the silver ant uses its hair to stay cool.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:43.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ant’s hairs are triangular-shaped tubes.

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:47.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like carefully crafted prisms,

00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:50.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
they reflect
the hottest wavelengths of sunlight

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and dissipate heat.

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:57.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some researchers think it may tolerate heat

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
better than any other animal on the planet.

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the natural world,

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
animals acquire,

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:08.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
conserve,

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:10.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
and manage energy

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:13.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
in remarkably efficient ways.

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:16.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the ability of animals
to manage energy evolve?

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:24.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or was it designed?
