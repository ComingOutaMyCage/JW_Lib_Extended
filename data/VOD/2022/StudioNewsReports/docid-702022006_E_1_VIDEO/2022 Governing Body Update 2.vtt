00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:03.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:06.819 line:10% position:50% align:center
We have many updates to share.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.196 line:10% position:50% align:center
Of course, the world’s attention

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.198 line:10% position:50% align:center
has been fixed on events

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Russia and Ukraine.

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s people,
we are not surprised by such events.

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re well aware that Russia and its allies

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill the role described in Daniel chapter 11

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the king of the north.”

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Governing Body
first made this identification

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:34.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the annual meeting in 2018,

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:37.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
we mentioned that the king of the north

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
had already taken possession of Crimea.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
When reading Daniel chapter 11,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not surprising
to see that the king of the north

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
is interested in other territories.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, this is the time

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:57.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep on the watch continually

00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:01.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to maintain our Christian neutrality!

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:06.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
As of February 28, we have no deaths,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we have one reported injury
among our brothers in Ukraine.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dozens of their homes have been damaged.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thousands of our brothers
have fled areas of military conflict.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re keeping you dear brothers and sisters

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:25.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Ukraine and Russia in our prayers.

00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:29.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,
we’re doing everything possible

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be sure that you’ll have
the needed spiritual food

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as the necessities of life.

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:42.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
With regard to legal matters,
during the week of February 21,

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had three significant court decisions.

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:50.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
On February 22, a court in Ust-Abakan

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:54.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
ruled to grant parole and release

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 70-year-old Valentina Baranovskaya.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Baranovskaya has been in prison

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the past 12 months.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prosecutor has until March 4 to appeal.

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:10.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
If there is no appeal,

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:15.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
then she could be released
as early as March 5.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:20.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please keep dear Sister Baranovskaya
in your prayers.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:26.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
On February 22, 2022,
the European Court of Human Rights

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
issued two significant judgments

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:32.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
concerning our brothers in Russia.

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cases involved
searches and police detention

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:40.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
affecting various brothers from 2010 to 2012.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
The court ruled in our favor
and awarded damages

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:50.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the 15 brothers and sisters
who were involved in these cases.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
In total, the government of Russia

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:58.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be required to pay nearly 100,000 euros.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
The court noted that the public ministry

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:06.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a fundamental right

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “a public authority”

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:10.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
should not interfere with.

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
In many countries,

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:17.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of COVID-19 cases is dropping.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:22.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some governments are starting to relax
or eliminate various restrictions.

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:27.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope that conditions
will allow us to resume

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
more of our theocratic activities in person.

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, we want to maintain
our cautious approach.

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:39.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
has directed Branch Committees

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:44.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
to monitor the situation
in each part of their branch territory.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each Branch Committee may initiate

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:50.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
or expand the pilot program

00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:55.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
for in-person meetings
when it can be done safely.

00:03:56.173 --> 00:04:00.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will it be possible
to hold an in-person Memorial

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:03.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your congregation this year?

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:06.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only time will tell.

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any case,
this may be a good time for all of us

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:16.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
to consider how we view
our congregation meetings.

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:19.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we can return to the Kingdom Hall,

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
will we be ready to do so?

00:04:22.992 --> 00:04:26.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about how we reason
with our Bible students

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:29.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the importance of attending meetings

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
in lesson 10
of the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book.

00:04:33.252 --> 00:04:34.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says:

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:39.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Effort is required to attend meetings.

00:04:39.884 --> 00:04:43.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Consider the example of Jesus’ family.

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:46.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To attend a yearly event, they had to walk

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“some 60 miles (100 km)

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through mountainous terrain

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Nazareth to Jerusalem.”

00:04:57.359 --> 00:04:59.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the book asks this question:

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:03.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why might you have to put forth effort

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:05.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend meetings?”

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:07.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt that soul-searching question

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:12.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
has prompted some Bible students
to begin to attend meetings.

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:17.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
But maybe that’s a question
that we’ll all have to think about.

00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:22.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Going back to in-person meetings
will take some effort on our part.

00:05:22.676 --> 00:05:26.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course,
we have to think about the blessings

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:31.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
that come from in-person association
with our brothers and sisters.

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:33.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can just imagine

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:37.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much Joseph and Mary and their children

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:40.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoyed being in person in Jerusalem

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:45.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the city was filled
with fellow worshippers of Jehovah!

00:05:45.574 --> 00:05:48.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt the joy from being there

00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:51.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped Joseph and Mary realize

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:55.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was truly worth the effort.

00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:59.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, our joy
in being at the Kingdom Hall

00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:01.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our dear brothers and sisters

00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:06.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
will far outweigh any initial inconvenience.

00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:10.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Until we can return to the Kingdom Hall,

00:06:10.432 --> 00:06:15.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
we appreciate the fine effort
that you dear brothers and sisters make

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:18.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend the meetings on Zoom.

00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:21.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
By connecting early and staying after,

00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:25.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have more opportunities
to do what’s mentioned

00:06:25.114 --> 00:06:29.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 10:24, 25:

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:32.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And let us consider one another

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so as to incite to love and fine works,

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:39.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not forsaking our meeting together,

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:40.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as some have the custom,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but encouraging one another,

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:45.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all the more so

00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:47.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you see the day drawing near.”

00:06:48.637 --> 00:06:51.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can experience the joy of giving

00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:55.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we actively ‘encourage
our brothers and sisters,

00:06:55.728 --> 00:07:00.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
inciting them to love and fine works.’

00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:05.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
why do we put forth all of this effort?

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:07.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we work so hard

00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:11.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain our own spirituality
and encourage others?

00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:16.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we want to keep our relationship

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:20.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah strong and at the same time

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:23.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
take our stand against

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:28.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
our great adversary, Satan the Devil.

00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:33.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember the warning recorded at 1 Peter 5:8.

00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:35.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we read:

00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:39.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep your senses, be watchful!

00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:41.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your adversary, the Devil,

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“walks about like a roaring lion,

00:07:44.318 --> 00:07:46.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeking to devour someone.”

00:07:48.072 --> 00:07:51.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the Devil
doesn’t cause all our problems,

00:07:51.534 --> 00:07:56.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s always looking for a way to use them.

00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:59.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would love to use the stress

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and isolation of the pandemic

00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:03.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
to weaken our faith

00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:08.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to sidetrack us with his propaganda.

00:08:08.217 --> 00:08:10.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us?

00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:13.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what’s stated in verse 9:

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:17.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But take your stand against him,

00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:19.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“firm in the faith,

00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:22.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“knowing that the same kind of sufferings

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are being experienced

00:08:24.692 --> 00:08:26.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the entire association

00:08:26.694 --> 00:08:29.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your brothers in the world.”

00:08:30.698 --> 00:08:32.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply put,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of Jehovah’s people
are facing the same attack!

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:41.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although our challenges may be different,

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:44.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter where we live on this earth,

00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:47.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are under attack.

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:49.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we meditate

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:53.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what our brothers and sisters
in other places are dealing with,

00:08:53.762 --> 00:08:57.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can help us
to see our challenges differently.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:08:59.852 --> 00:09:01.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about our brothers and sisters

00:09:01.854 --> 00:09:05.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
facing natural disasters and persecution.

00:09:07.026 --> 00:09:09.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far this service year,

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:11.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers have been affected

00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:14.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
by over 120 disasters.

00:09:14.992 --> 00:09:16.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider a few examples.

00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:22.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
In December,
Typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette)

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:25.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
devastated the Philippines.

00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:28.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, four publishers died,

00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:30.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
a dozen were injured,

00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:34.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 2,000 were displaced.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
And can you imagine?

00:09:36.472 --> 00:09:40.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 1,700 of our brothers’ homes

00:09:40.893 --> 00:09:44.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
were damaged or destroyed!

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, in January,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tropical Storm Ana struck

00:09:48.776 --> 00:09:50.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
southeastern Africa.

00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:54.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, one brother lost his wife

00:09:54.073 --> 00:09:56.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two children.

00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:59.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three brothers and a child were injured,

00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:02.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 2,000 were displaced,

00:10:02.373 --> 00:10:05.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 400 of our brothers’ homes

00:10:05.334 --> 00:10:08.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
were damaged or destroyed.

00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:11.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on February 15,

00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:15.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
heavy rainstorms and mudslides hit Brazil.

00:10:15.761 --> 00:10:18.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, one of our brothers

00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:20.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his two-year-old son

00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:22.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
were swept away by a mudslide.

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:27.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
The father survived despite serious injuries.

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:31.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
But tragically, his son died.

00:10:31.068 --> 00:10:34.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, another brother also died.

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:39.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray for all
who have lost loved ones

00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:43.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
or who have been affected
by these recent disasters.

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:47.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to natural disasters,

00:10:47.668 --> 00:10:51.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers also face civil unrest.

00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:54.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:57.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of our brothers and sisters
in several regions

00:10:57.845 --> 00:11:01.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
have had to flee their villages and fields.

00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:03.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, with Jehovah’s help,

00:11:03.893 --> 00:11:05.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve been able to provide

00:11:05.936 --> 00:11:08.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 81 tons of food

00:11:08.772 --> 00:11:13.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
to assist more than 19,600 people!

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:17.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
We deeply appreciate your support

00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:20.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters
who are facing disasters.

00:11:20.993 --> 00:11:24.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your prayers and generous donations

00:11:24.747 --> 00:11:27.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
are having a tremendous impact.

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:29.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:32.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite all these disasters,

00:11:32.922 --> 00:11:36.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters
remain firm in the faith.

00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:41.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear how some
in Congo, the Philippines,

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:45.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Caribbean
feel about the help they’ve received.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
I sincerely thank Jehovah

00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:04.537 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the material support to help me

00:12:04.537 --> 00:12:06.747 line:10% position:50% align:center
return to my normal life.

00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:14.839 line:10% position:50% align:center
For me, thank you is not enough

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:17.591 line:10% position:50% align:center
to express my appreciation

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:20.302 line:10% position:50% align:center
for all the good things that we’ve received,

00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:25.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
since I was among
those who were helped to have

00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:27.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
damaged houses repaired.

00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:31.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers really helped us.

00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:36.986 line:10% position:50% align:center
Despite the difficulties

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:39.363 line:10% position:50% align:center
brought on by Typhoon Odette,

00:12:39.363 --> 00:12:42.032 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not abandon us.

00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:44.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped us.

00:12:44.368 --> 00:12:48.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the very next day,
the brothers contacted us

00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:52.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provided us food
and helped us repair our house.

00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:57.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so thankful for Jehovah’s help

00:12:57.256 --> 00:12:59.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for providing us our needs

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:02.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can continue with our lives!

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:18.068 line:10% position:50% align:center
I sincerely thank Jehovah

00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:19.904 line:10% position:50% align:center
and his organization for the love

00:13:19.904 --> 00:13:21.780 line:10% position:50% align:center
they have shown us during this time

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.407 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we became victims

00:13:23.407 --> 00:13:25.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the volcanic eruption.

00:13:25.284 --> 00:13:27.286 line:10% position:50% align:center
We don’t know what words

00:13:27.286 --> 00:13:30.206 line:10% position:50% align:center
to use to express our gratitude.

00:13:30.206 --> 00:13:32.958 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s like Jehovah is taking us by his hand,

00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
caring for us, and saying: “Do not be afraid.

00:13:36.712 --> 00:13:38.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will help you.”

00:13:38.797 --> 00:13:41.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly, we are very thankful.

00:13:42.927 --> 00:13:45.721 line:10% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for getting us this house,

00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:48.182 line:10% position:50% align:center
because our house burned down.

00:13:48.182 --> 00:13:51.268 line:10% position:50% align:center
And to you servants of Jehovah,

00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:53.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to tell you

00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:57.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.288 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I left,

00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:13.290 line:10% position:50% align:center
I left with the clothes on my back.

00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:18.796 line:10% position:50% align:center
The condition that we left our home in—

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:20.798 line:10% position:50% align:center
And coming back and seeing the work

00:14:20.798 --> 00:14:22.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the brothers did for us,

00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:24.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know how

00:14:24.927 --> 00:14:27.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put it into words.

00:14:27.137 --> 00:14:29.223 line:10% position:50% align:center
I love and appreciate

00:14:29.223 --> 00:14:31.058 line:10% position:50% align:center
every single one of you

00:14:31.058 --> 00:14:32.935 line:10% position:50% align:center
and what you have done for us.

00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:35.312 line:10% position:50% align:center
You will never understand just how much

00:14:35.312 --> 00:14:40.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
it means to know that we don’t
have to do this by ourselves.

00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:56.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m very, very thankful
to see Jehovah’s blessing.

00:15:05.885 --> 00:15:10.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another challenge our brothers and sisters
are facing is persecution.

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:15.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take, for example, Sister Anna Safronova.

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:17.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
On January 25,

00:15:17.605 --> 00:15:19.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
56-year-old Anna

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
was sentenced to six years in a penal colony.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the harshest, longest sentence

00:15:27.281 --> 00:15:29.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
imposed on a sister in Russia

00:15:29.658 --> 00:15:32.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
since the 2017 ban.

00:15:32.828 --> 00:15:34.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
The court imprisoned Anna

00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:39.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though she was
the caregiver for her 81-year-old mother.

00:15:40.503 --> 00:15:45.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
What challenges do the family members
of those imprisoned face?

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:48.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is Jehovah helping them?

00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:52.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch the following
interviews from Russia.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our trials and hardships

00:15:56.602 --> 00:15:59.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
began on June 12, 2018,

00:15:59.855 --> 00:16:02.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
when authorities searched our home.

00:16:04.109 --> 00:16:07.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we didn’t see Aleksey for 11 months

00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:11.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he was
in the pretrial detention center.

00:16:13.118 --> 00:16:16.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
The judge sentenced
him to three and a half years

00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:18.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a general regime prison colony.

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:24.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then another terrible thing happened.

00:16:24.213 --> 00:16:28.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the fire when our home burned
to the ground in the middle of the night.

00:16:30.052 --> 00:16:35.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
In October 2020,
the children and I got COVID.

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:39.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just recently,
we came down with COVID for a second time.

00:16:39.979 --> 00:16:42.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I live with my daughter, Anna.

00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:45.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
In July 2021,

00:16:45.818 --> 00:16:48.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
our home was searched,

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:52.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on January 25, 2022,

00:16:52.867 --> 00:16:56.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
a court sentenced her to six years in prison.

00:16:57.162 --> 00:16:59.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were not even allowed

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say goodbye to each other.

00:17:07.173 --> 00:17:10.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad has been in a prison
for a year and a half already.

00:17:13.721 --> 00:17:16.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
In January of this year, he was sentenced

00:17:16.015 --> 00:17:19.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
to seven years in a correctional facility.

00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:21.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with all of that,

00:17:21.187 --> 00:17:25.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of last year,
my mother died unexpectedly from COVID.

00:17:25.733 --> 00:17:28.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
One trial is difficult enough,

00:17:28.402 --> 00:17:31.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when you get two at the same time—

00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:36.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the two people
who are dearest to me are no longer with me.

00:17:39.538 --> 00:17:41.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
I pray to Jehovah

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel that he gives
me peace of heart and a sense of calm.

00:17:46.086 --> 00:17:49.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I don’t worry quite as much.

00:17:49.715 --> 00:17:53.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friends come over
and help me with the cleaning,

00:17:53.177 --> 00:17:56.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they go shopping for me, and we chat.

00:17:56.055 --> 00:17:59.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
In all of that, I see Jehovah’s hand

00:17:59.558 --> 00:18:02.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his help and his support.

00:18:04.438 --> 00:18:07.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah constantly strengthened us
by means of his Word.

00:18:07.983 --> 00:18:10.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he used the brothers.

00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:12.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, our friends

00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:15.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
sent us text messages,
quoting the very scriptures

00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:17.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gave me strength.

00:18:17.243 --> 00:18:19.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
These were answers to my prayers.

00:18:19.578 --> 00:18:22.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was my parent’s wedding anniversary,

00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:24.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all day it was, like—

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:28.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Couriers were bringing us gifts,
flowers, and parcels.

00:18:28.629 --> 00:18:30.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was, like—

00:18:30.256 --> 00:18:33.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
The whole day the house was full of flowers.

00:18:33.092 --> 00:18:36.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was as though Jehovah
were shouting to us: “I love you.

00:18:36.303 --> 00:18:38.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m right with you.
I won’t leave you!”

00:18:38.472 --> 00:18:41.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Sasha said,
“Mum, if Dad had been free,

00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:45.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would have had only
one bouquet of flowers at the most!”

00:18:47.147 --> 00:18:50.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember that time
when you were afraid to shout out:

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:51.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dad!
I love you!

00:18:51.986 --> 00:18:54.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hang in there.
Jehovah loves you!”?

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
You mustered up courage,
and we prayed as well.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he wrote in letters that he cried

00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:08.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he was so happy that he had heard me.

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:11.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
My faith has only been made stronger.

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:13.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve started reading the Bible every day.

00:19:13.674 --> 00:19:17.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, I’ve taken a big step
toward Jehovah—even two.

00:19:17.678 --> 00:19:20.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
I dedicated my life to him and was baptized.

00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:24.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times I remembered
the thought that Jehovah

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
often embraces us using someone else’s arms.

00:19:27.563 --> 00:19:29.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in these last years,

00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:32.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have felt Jehovah’s embrace many times.

00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:36.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah always turns
hardships into blessings.

00:19:36.739 --> 00:19:38.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was the fire, and we lost our home.

00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:42.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we have a new home,
which is better than the previous one.

00:19:42.745 --> 00:19:44.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am certain that whatever happens,

00:19:44.413 --> 00:19:46.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will definitely get through it.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
The main thing is to be close to Jehovah.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so proud

00:19:56.592 --> 00:20:00.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all those
who are standing firm in the faith

00:20:00.763 --> 00:20:03.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite persecution.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re reminded of 2 Corinthians 4:9:

00:20:07.853 --> 00:20:12.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are persecuted, but not abandoned;

00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:16.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are knocked down, but not destroyed.”

00:20:17.488 --> 00:20:22.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will never
abandon his faithful servants.

00:20:22.284 --> 00:20:25.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve been reminded in this update,

00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:28.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters worldwide

00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:31.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to “stand firm in the faith”

00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:36.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite military actions, a global pandemic,

00:20:36.423 --> 00:20:40.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
disasters, and persecution.

00:20:40.094 --> 00:20:42.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:20:42.096 --> 00:20:46.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
as 1 Peter 5:8 says:

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep your senses, be watchful!”

00:20:51.146 --> 00:20:56.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our adversary, Satan the Devil,
has filled this world

00:20:56.026 --> 00:20:59.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his satanic propaganda.

00:20:59.405 --> 00:21:01.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be cautious!

00:21:01.615 --> 00:21:04.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take your stand against him.”

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the world becomes

00:21:06.495 --> 00:21:10.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
more and more nationalistic and divided,

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:14.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not compromise our neutrality.

00:21:14.879 --> 00:21:17.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will remain united

00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:20.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our loyalty to God’s Kingdom

00:21:20.634 --> 00:21:23.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in our love for one another.

00:21:23.971 --> 00:21:27.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to listen to the voice

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:30.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our Fine Shepherd, Jesus Christ,

00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:35.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his appointed channel,
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:21:35.107 --> 00:21:39.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our almighty God, Jehovah, is with us!

00:21:39.612 --> 00:21:44.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have our
worldwide brotherhood to support us.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what trials lay ahead,

00:21:46.911 --> 00:21:49.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have everything we need

00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:53.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain faithful to Jehovah.

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:57.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,
we love you all very much.

00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:02.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:22:02.176 --> 00:22:04.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
