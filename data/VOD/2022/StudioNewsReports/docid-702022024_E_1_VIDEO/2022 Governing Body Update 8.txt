00:00:01 Welcome!
00:00:03 In this program,
00:00:04 we’re going to talk about the importance
00:00:06 of adapting as Jehovah’s chariot moves.
00:00:11 But first, here are a few updates.
00:00:15 Earlier this year, the Governing Body approved for branch visits
00:00:18 to resume during the 2023 service year.
00:00:22 The Service Committee
00:00:24 assigns Governing Body members
00:00:26 to make shepherding visits on branches.
00:00:29 It also assigns headquarters representatives
00:00:32 to visit branches.
00:00:34 This is similar to when circuit overseers
00:00:36 visit congregations,
00:00:38 except that the Governing Body members
00:00:40 and headquarters representatives
00:00:42 visit branches.
00:00:45 As of November 28,
00:00:47 over 15 of these visits
00:00:49 have already taken place this service year.
00:00:52 These visits have resulted
00:00:54 in a tremendous
00:00:56 “interchange of encouragement”
00:00:58 for all involved
00:00:59 and have strengthened our unity.
00:01:03 We have also heard positive comments
00:01:06 about the special meetings with pioneers
00:01:09 that are held in conjunction with circuit assemblies.
00:01:13 One pioneer in New York said:
00:01:15 “I attended the first in-person pioneer meeting
00:01:18 “in three years at the Queens Assembly Hall today.
00:01:22 “I couldn’t hold back tears a couple of times
00:01:25 “because our Father deeply understood
00:01:28 “what we went through during the pandemic.
00:01:31 Jehovah is good indeed.”
00:01:35 No doubt many of our pioneers around the globe feel similarly.
00:01:42 It’s also encouraging to hear
00:01:45 that the Local Design/Construction work
00:01:47 is moving ahead.
00:01:49 Where there are no government restrictions,
00:01:52 Kingdom Hall construction groups have restarted.
00:01:56 What theocratic construction is on the horizon?
00:02:00 We now need over 15,700 new Kingdom Halls
00:02:05 and major renovations around the world.
00:02:08 We need these Kingdom Halls
00:02:10 for our in-person meetings!
00:02:13 To begin addressing these needs,
00:02:15 over 1,600 projects worldwide
00:02:18 are planned for this year alone.
00:02:21 And branches are also working hard
00:02:23 to prepare facilities
00:02:25 for in-person circuit assemblies and theocratic schools
00:02:28 starting in January 2023.
00:02:31 Can you make yourself available
00:02:33 to help with theocratic construction?
00:02:37 Ask your congregation elders for more information.
00:02:41 It’s wonderful to see young people
00:02:43 assisting with the work.
00:02:44 Think of the training they’re receiving now
00:02:47 that they’ll be able to use during the great rebuilding work
00:02:50 after Armageddon.
00:02:53 We have another exciting update regarding freedom of worship.
00:02:58 As Jesus foretold at Matthew 10:22,
00:03:01 we face much opposition.
00:03:05 Jesus said:
00:03:06 “And you will be hated
00:03:08 by all people on account of my name.”
00:03:12 To assist Jehovah’s people,
00:03:14 we have recently established the Freedom of Worship Office
00:03:19 at the Central Europe branch.
00:03:21 This headquarters department
00:03:23 will coordinate our efforts to defend our worship in Europe.
00:03:28 Now, you might be wondering:
00:03:31 ‘The work has been established throughout Europe for many years,
00:03:34 so is this really needed?’
00:03:37 Yes, it is.
00:03:40 For example, recently, the government of Norway
00:03:43 decided that Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:03:46 would no longer receive certain state benefits
00:03:49 that are provided to all registered religions.
00:03:53 Here to explain more about this
00:03:55 is Brother Jørgen Pedersen.
00:03:58 We were shocked when we received a letter
00:04:01 from government authorities in Oslo, Norway,
00:04:04 threatening to remove our registration
00:04:06 as a religious community.
00:04:09 Jehovah’s Witnesses have been actively preaching the good news in Norway
00:04:13 for more than 120 years!
00:04:15 In fact, Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:04:18 suffered for their faith
00:04:20 under the Nazi occupation of Norway
00:04:22 during World War II.
00:04:23 Commenting on how Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:04:26 were the only religious group
00:04:27 who stood firm against the Nazis,
00:04:30 a previous minister for religion exclaimed:
00:04:33 ‘People throughout the country should know about this
00:04:36 —especially young ones would benefit from this information.’
00:04:41 We’ve always been known as good citizens.
00:04:44 In fact, a public report stated
00:04:46 that Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:04:48 ‘are careful to obey the laws of the land.’
00:04:52 Now they’ve suspended our grants,
00:04:54 while there are over 700 religious communities
00:04:57 who continue to receive such state benefits.
00:05:00 This decision is unconstitutional
00:05:04 and an unprecedented attack
00:05:07 on religious freedom in Norway.
00:05:09 With the assistance
00:05:10 of the newly established Freedom of Worship Office,
00:05:14 we’re pursuing legal remedies.
00:05:16 At the same time,
00:05:18 we’re pursuing dialogue with government officials.
00:05:21 And we pray that this situation will be amicably resolved.
00:05:26 Thank you, Brother Pedersen.
00:05:29 The authorities in Norway
00:05:31 have threatened to remove our legal registration
00:05:35 because of our Scriptural beliefs and practices
00:05:38 regarding disfellowshipping.
00:05:41 In the future, various governments
00:05:44 will challenge our freedom of worship.
00:05:48 They may pressure us to change our Scriptural beliefs.
00:05:52 But we’re certainly not going to do that!
00:05:57 As Brother Pedersen mentioned,
00:05:59 efforts are being made to address this issue.
00:06:02 In the meantime,
00:06:04 please make it a matter of prayer.
00:06:11 At the beginning of the pandemic,
00:06:13 many activities were quickly suspended.
00:06:17 But now, as we’re coming out of the pandemic,
00:06:21 many activities are quickly resuming.
00:06:24 And this is no surprise because Jehovah’s celestial chariot
00:06:28 moves swiftly, like lightning.
00:06:32 Notice how this is described at Ezekiel 1:16, 17.
00:06:38 Here Ezekiel gets an awe-inspiring glimpse of the chariot.
00:06:42 He describes it this way:
00:06:45 “The wheels and their structure
00:06:47 “appeared to glow like chrysolite,
00:06:49 “and the four of them looked alike.
00:06:51 “Their appearance and structure looked
00:06:53 “as though a wheel were within a wheel.
00:06:56 “When they moved,
00:06:57 “they could go in any of the four directions
00:07:00 without turning as they went.”
00:07:03 What an amazing vision of the heavenly part
00:07:06 of Jehovah’s universal organization!
00:07:10 The Pure Worship  book explains:
00:07:12 “Jehovah’s chariot perfectly reflects the reasonable,
00:07:17 “adaptable God who is in control of it.
00:07:21 “As his very name suggests,
00:07:23 “he can become anything that is needed
00:07:26 “in order to accomplish his purpose. . . .
00:07:29 “Never should we . . . worry
00:07:31 “that our God will be late in responding to our needs
00:07:35 “or that his organization will fail to adapt to some new challenge
00:07:40 “arising in the volatile world around us.
00:07:43 “We do well to remember
00:07:45 “that Jehovah’s organization is active,
00:07:48 ever on the move.”
00:07:51 We’ve certainly experienced the truth of these words
00:07:54 during the pandemic.
00:07:57 Thank you for the fine spirit you show
00:08:00 as we all adapt to these changes.
00:08:04 Earlier in the pandemic,
00:08:06 we couldn’t meet together in person.
00:08:09 But as a result of faithfully following the chariot,
00:08:12 we adapted and used videoconferencing
00:08:15 for our meetings and ministry.
00:08:17 Thankfully, circumstances are different now.
00:08:21 We rejoice to be able to meet in person again.
00:08:25 Back in July, the Governing Body prepared an announcement
00:08:29 that was read in all congregations about attending in-person meetings.
00:08:34 Do you recall some of the key points from that announcement?
00:08:39 The announcement began:
00:08:41 “In reviewing the results of resuming
00:08:43 “in-person congregation meetings . . . ,
00:08:45 “it is evident that Jehovah
00:08:47 “is clearly blessing this arrangement.
00:08:50 “We thank Jehovah for the opportunity
00:08:53 “to greet our brothers and sisters face-to-face,
00:08:56 “sing songs of praise to Jehovah harmoniously,
00:09:00 “and make other appropriate expressions
00:09:03 “of Christian affection once again.
00:09:06 “After more than two years
00:09:08 “of not being able to meet together at our Kingdom Halls,
00:09:11 “we have renewed appreciation for in-person Christian meetings
00:09:16 “that lift our spirits and strengthen our faith
00:09:19 during these difficult times.”
00:09:22 The announcement continued:
00:09:25 “We acknowledge that because of advanced age,
00:09:28 “infirmities, or other circumstances,
00:09:31 “some may be limited in their ability to attend meetings in person.
00:09:36 “For such ones, please keep in mind
00:09:38 “the loving reminder at Hebrews 6:10:
00:09:42 “‘God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work
00:09:45 “‘and the love you showed for his name
00:09:48 by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.’”
00:09:53 Jehovah will never forget you and your faithful service!
00:09:58 You continue to show your love for his name
00:10:00 as you regularly attend and participate in meetings on Zoom.
00:10:05 And this is such an encouragement to the congregation.
00:10:08 Now, some of us got used to doing everything on Zoom.
00:10:14 I know for me,
00:10:16 only for Jehovah would I have done what we needed to do
00:10:19 during the pandemic.
00:10:21 As soon as we could,
00:10:23 I was so happy to go back to the Kingdom Hall.
00:10:26 There really is nothing like being together
00:10:29 with our brothers and sisters in person.
00:10:33 I appreciate that others can’t.
00:10:35 But I was happy to get back to the hall.
00:10:38 Many feel the same way.
00:10:41 Let’s hear how some of our brothers and sisters feel
00:10:44 about being back in person at the Kingdom Hall.
00:10:50 I was so sad when they announced
00:10:52 that we would stop having meetings
00:10:54 at the Kingdom Hall because of COVID.
00:10:59 I felt trapped
00:11:03 because I couldn’t go to the Kingdom Hall anymore
00:11:05 to be fed spiritually.
00:11:09 For two years, the faithful slave made arrangements
00:11:13 for us to listen to the meetings over the radio.
00:11:19 Since I did not have a radio,
00:11:22 I went to different brothers’ homes to listen to the meetings.
00:11:28 Then the elders arranged to start having meetings on Zoom.
00:11:32 I do not have a smartphone,
00:11:34 so I had to go to the homes of those in the congregation.
00:11:37 Sometimes after arriving,
00:11:39 I would find out that their Internet data bundle was used up.
00:11:43 This made the pandemic very difficult for me.
00:11:47 When I heard the news  that “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:11:50 decided to resume in-person meetings,
00:11:54 I was just so happy!
00:11:58 Now I can see the brothers and sisters
00:12:00 that I had not seen during the pandemic.
00:12:03 I am back at the Kingdom Hall;
00:12:05 I am back where I can have my spiritual food
00:12:08 the way I have always enjoyed it.
00:12:11 To not be able to go to the hall
00:12:14 was a challenge for me.
00:12:15 It wasn’t easy.
00:12:17 But I appreciated Zoom
00:12:19 because we kept being fed spiritually
00:12:21 and that was a blessing.
00:12:23 But still, I missed the people.
00:12:25 When I heard we were going back in person, I was so excited.
00:12:29 I was like a child going into a candy store.
00:12:32 I was so excited.
00:12:34 It was great. It really was energizing.
00:12:37 You felt alive again.
00:12:41 We all have challenges.
00:12:42 We’re tired.
00:12:44 So who doesn’t need to be energized?
00:12:46 We all do.
00:12:47 And so to come to the Kingdom Hall
00:12:49 —there’s no question that I am going to the meeting.
00:12:53 You’re with the older friends, even older than me,
00:12:57 and younger ones.
00:12:59 Little children come running up to you.
00:13:02 That just brings joy to your heart and a smile on your face.
00:13:05 And I think that’s the experience
00:13:07 Jehovah wants us to have as a brotherhood.
00:13:10 So I feel more fulfilled by being at the Kingdom Hall.
00:13:14 I’m happy.
00:13:17 It’s heartwarming to hear their expressions.
00:13:22 We’ve received many positive reports about in-person meetings.
00:13:27 For example, the Burundi branch recently wrote:
00:13:32 “The decision to return to in-person meetings
00:13:35 “has been a great blessing to our brothers and sisters in Burundi.
00:13:41 “Although they did what they could to connect virtually,
00:13:44 “the reality was that many
00:13:47 “just did not have the circumstances to do so.
00:13:51 “Since resuming in-person congregation meetings,
00:13:54 “our attendance has increased tremendously throughout the country.
00:13:59 “For example, in one congregation,
00:14:02 “the attendance was 140 persons
00:14:05 “when the meetings were held virtually,
00:14:07 “but after resuming in-person meetings at the Kingdom Hall,
00:14:11 the attendance is now 227.”
00:14:17 Continuing with the announcement,
00:14:19 we want to draw your attention to this one comment.
00:14:23 After acknowledging those with advanced age,
00:14:26 infirmities, and other circumstances
00:14:29 that may prevent them from attending meetings in person,
00:14:33 the announcement included this thought-provoking statement:
00:14:38 “On the other hand, some brothers and sisters
00:14:42 “—younger and in good health—
00:14:44 “have more favorable circumstances
00:14:47 “that may allow them to attend Christian meetings regularly
00:14:52 “at the Kingdom Hall.
00:14:54 “However, it has been observed
00:14:57 “that some have developed a tendency
00:14:59 “to attend meetings on a videoconference when,
00:15:02 “according to their circumstances,
00:15:05 they could be physically at the Kingdom Hall.”
00:15:09 That’s what the announcement said.
00:15:12 It’s something we can continue to reflect on.
00:15:16 The chariot is moving!
00:15:18 We’re getting ready for in-person circuit assemblies
00:15:21 and regional conventions.
00:15:24 So now is an excellent time
00:15:26 to evaluate our attitude about in-person meetings.
00:15:32 Again, we appreciate that some cannot attend in person.
00:15:37 But on the other hand, maybe some could.
00:15:41 What will help each of us to honestly evaluate
00:15:44 our personal circumstances?
00:15:47 Well, the announcement drew our attention to three verses
00:15:52 that express Jehovah’s thinking on this important matter.
00:15:57 Let’s read just one of those verses
00:16:00 at Psalm 22:22:
00:16:04 “I will declare your name to my brothers;
00:16:07 in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.”
00:16:12 How we cherish our opportunities
00:16:14 to be “in the midst of the congregation”
00:16:17 at in-person meetings!
00:16:20 The announcement concluded by saying:
00:16:23 “Strong faith and endurance are required
00:16:28 “to face deteriorating world conditions.
00:16:32 “So, we take this opportunity
00:16:34 “to warmly commend you dear brothers and sisters
00:16:36 “for your faithfulness, love, and heartful desire
00:16:41 “to praise our glorious God, Jehovah.
00:16:44 We love you very much!”
00:16:48 Our brothers and sisters in Ukraine
00:16:50 have faced especially challenging circumstances
00:16:54 when it comes to holding in-person meetings.
00:16:57 Recently, approximately
100 congregations in Ukraine
00:17:02 were approved to resume in-person meetings
00:17:06 where it was safe to do so.
00:17:09 The brothers and sisters responded enthusiastically.
00:17:14 Notice some of their expressions, which highlight the joy and benefits
00:17:19 of in-person meetings.
00:17:22 A sister named Svitlana says:
00:17:26 “When the announcement was read about the return to in-person meetings,
00:17:30 “the first thing I did
00:17:32 “was thank Jehovah in fervent prayer.
00:17:36 “Meetings at the Kingdom Hall refresh and give emotional strength.
00:17:41 “The hugs and conversations
00:17:43 “improve my mood and give me the needed support.
00:17:48 “This is especially the case after spending hours in basements
00:17:53 and hearing bombs explode.”
00:17:57 Nadia states:
00:18:00 “I compare online meetings
00:18:02 “to rescue boats helping us to stay afloat.
00:18:06 “Attending in-person meetings
00:18:08 “feels like being aboard a huge cruise ship.
00:18:12 “The war is taking an emotional and physical toll on all of us,
00:18:16 “but when I am in the Kingdom Hall,
00:18:18 I forget about my problems, my worries, and even the war.”
00:18:25 Brother Stanislav who got baptized during the pandemic
00:18:29 without ever having attended a meeting at the Kingdom Hall says:
00:18:34 “I am a modern person and found our Zoom meetings OK.
00:18:39 “But I did not expect that the atmosphere
00:18:42 “in the Kingdom Hall would be so overwhelming.
00:18:46 “I also find it easier to follow
00:18:49 the presented material and to remember it.”
00:18:55 We’re encouraged by the determination
00:18:57 of our brothers and sisters in Ukraine
00:18:59 to attend in-person meetings
00:19:01 despite the many challenges they face.
00:19:05 Their expressions echo the words of Psalm 122:1:
00:19:11 “I rejoiced when they said to me:
00:19:14 ‘Let us go to the house of Jehovah.’”
00:19:18 What have we learned from this update?
00:19:20 As we’ve seen from Ezekiel’s vision,
00:19:23 we must always be ready to adapt
00:19:26 when Jehovah’s chariot moves.
00:19:29 We do so not only by attending meetings
00:19:32 and participating in the field ministry
00:19:34 but also by staying up-to-date
00:19:36 with our spiritual feeding program.
00:19:40 By keeping pace with Jehovah’s chariot,
00:19:43 we show that we respect and have confidence in Jehovah.
00:19:49 As a result, we enjoy what is stated
00:19:52 at Psalm 29:11:
00:19:55 “Jehovah will give strength to his people.
00:19:58 Jehovah will bless his people with peace.”
00:20:02 Yes, by being part of Jehovah’s organization,
00:20:06 we share in the strength and peace
00:20:09 that only he can provide.
00:20:13 May we all continue to adapt as Jehovah’s chariot moves
00:20:18 and enjoy his rich blessing.
