WEBVTT

00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:03.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:03.023 --> 00:00:04.733 line:10% position:50% align:center
In this program,

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.902 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’re going to talk about the importance

00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:11.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
of adapting as Jehovah’s chariot moves.

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:15.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, here are a few updates.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier this year,
the Governing Body approved for branch visits

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:22.710 line:10% position:50% align:center
to resume during the 2023 service year.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.336 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Service Committee

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.046 line:10% position:50% align:center
assigns Governing Body members

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:29.216 line:10% position:50% align:center
to make shepherding visits on branches.

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:32.177 line:10% position:50% align:center
It also assigns headquarters representatives

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:34.221 line:10% position:50% align:center
to visit branches.

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.640 line:10% position:50% align:center
This is similar to when circuit overseers

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.142 line:10% position:50% align:center
visit congregations,

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.811 line:10% position:50% align:center
except that the Governing Body members

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.813 line:10% position:50% align:center
and headquarters representatives

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:45.399 line:10% position:50% align:center
visit branches.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.484 line:10% position:50% align:center
As of November 28,

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:49.778 line:10% position:50% align:center
over 15 of these visits

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:52.865 line:10% position:50% align:center
have already taken place this service year.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:54.909 line:10% position:50% align:center
These visits have resulted

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.493 line:10% position:50% align:center
in a tremendous

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:58.412 line:10% position:50% align:center
“interchange of encouragement”

00:00:58.412 --> 00:00:59.955 line:10% position:50% align:center
for all involved

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:02.541 line:10% position:50% align:center
and have strengthened our unity.

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:06.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have also heard positive comments

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the special meetings with pioneers

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are held in conjunction
with circuit assemblies.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
One pioneer in New York said:

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I attended the first
in-person pioneer meeting

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:22.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in three years
at the Queens Assembly Hall today.

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I couldn’t hold back tears a couple of times

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because our Father deeply understood

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what we went through during the pandemic.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is good indeed.”

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt many of our pioneers
around the globe feel similarly.

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also encouraging to hear

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Local Design/Construction work

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
is moving ahead.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where there are no government restrictions,

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:56.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kingdom Hall construction groups
have restarted.

00:01:56.178 --> 00:01:59.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
What theocratic construction
is on the horizon?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now need over 15,700 new Kingdom Halls

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
and major renovations around the world.

00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need these Kingdom Halls

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:13.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our in-person meetings!

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:15.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin addressing these needs,

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 1,600 projects worldwide

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
are planned for this year alone.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
And branches are also working hard

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prepare facilities

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:28.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
for in-person circuit assemblies
and theocratic schools

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting in January 2023.

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you make yourself available

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:36.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help with theocratic construction?

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:39.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask your congregation elders
for more information.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:43.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s wonderful to see young people

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:44.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
assisting with the work.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the training they’re receiving now

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:50.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they’ll be able to use
during the great rebuilding work

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:52.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Armageddon.

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:57.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have another exciting update
regarding freedom of worship.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jesus foretold at Matthew 10:22,

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:04.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
we face much opposition.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said:

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you will be hated

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:11.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
by all people on account of my name.”

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:14.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
To assist Jehovah’s people,

00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:19.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have recently established
the Freedom of Worship Office

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:21.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Central Europe branch.

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:23.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
This headquarters department

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:27.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
will coordinate our efforts
to defend our worship in Europe.

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you might be wondering:

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The work has been established
throughout Europe for many years,

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:36.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
so is this really needed?’

00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, recently,
the government of Norway

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
decided that Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
would no longer receive
certain state benefits

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:52.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are provided
to all registered religions.

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:55.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here to explain more about this

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Brother Jørgen Pedersen.

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:01.553 line:10% position:50% align:center
We were shocked when we received a letter

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.264 line:10% position:50% align:center
from government authorities in Oslo, Norway,

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:06.809 line:10% position:50% align:center
threatening to remove our registration

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a religious community.

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have been
actively preaching the good news in Norway

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.609 line:10% position:50% align:center
for more than 120 years!

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:20.072 line:10% position:50% align:center
suffered for their faith

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:22.032 line:10% position:50% align:center
under the Nazi occupation of Norway

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:23.867 line:10% position:50% align:center
during World War II.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.120 line:10% position:50% align:center
Commenting on how Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.329 line:10% position:50% align:center
were the only religious group

00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
who stood firm against the Nazis,

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:33.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
a previous minister for religion exclaimed:

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:36.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘People throughout the country
should know about this

00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:40.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
—especially young ones
would benefit from this information.’

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve always been known as good citizens.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:46.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, a public report stated

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:48.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘are careful to obey the laws of the land.’

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:54.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now they’ve suspended our grants,

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:57.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
while there are
over 700 religious communities

00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
who continue to receive such state benefits.

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:04.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
This decision is unconstitutional

00:05:04.032 --> 00:05:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an unprecedented attack

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:09.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
on religious freedom in Norway.

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:10.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the assistance

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:14.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the newly established
Freedom of Worship Office,

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re pursuing legal remedies.

00:05:16.378 --> 00:05:18.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:21.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re pursuing dialogue
with government officials.

00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:25.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we pray that this situation
will be amicably resolved.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Pedersen.

00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:31.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
The authorities in Norway

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:35.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
have threatened
to remove our legal registration

00:05:35.314 --> 00:05:38.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of our Scriptural beliefs
and practices

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:40.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding disfellowshipping.

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:44.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the future, various governments

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
will challenge our freedom of worship.

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:52.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may pressure us
to change our Scriptural beliefs.

00:05:52.664 --> 00:05:55.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re certainly not going to do that!

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Brother Pedersen mentioned,

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:02.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
efforts are being made to address this issue.

00:06:02.674 --> 00:06:04.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the meantime,

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
please make it a matter of prayer.

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the beginning of the pandemic,

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:17.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
many activities were quickly suspended.

00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:21.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, as we’re coming out of the pandemic,

00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:23.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
many activities are quickly resuming.

00:06:24.488 --> 00:06:28.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is no surprise
because Jehovah’s celestial chariot

00:06:28.575 --> 00:06:31.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
moves swiftly, like lightning.

00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:37.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how this is described
at Ezekiel 1:16, 17.

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:42.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here Ezekiel
gets an awe-inspiring glimpse of the chariot.

00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:44.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
He describes it this way:

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wheels and their structure

00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:49.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“appeared to glow like chrysolite,

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:51.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the four of them looked alike.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Their appearance and structure looked

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as though a wheel were within a wheel.

00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When they moved,

00:06:57.854 --> 00:07:00.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they could go in any of the four directions

00:07:00.232 --> 00:07:02.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
without turning as they went.”

00:07:03.318 --> 00:07:06.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an amazing vision of the heavenly part

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:09.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s universal organization!

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Pure Worship </i> book explains:

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:17.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s chariot
perfectly reflects the reasonable,

00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:21.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“adaptable God who is in control of it.

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:23.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As his very name suggests,

00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:26.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he can become anything that is needed

00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:29.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to accomplish his purpose. . . .

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:31.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Never should we . . . worry

00:07:31.972 --> 00:07:35.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that our God will be late
in responding to our needs

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or that his organization
will fail to adapt to some new challenge

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:43.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“arising in the volatile world around us.

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:45.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We do well to remember

00:07:45.193 --> 00:07:48.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah’s organization is active, 

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
ever on the move.”

00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:54.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve certainly experienced
the truth of these words

00:07:54.202 --> 00:07:56.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the pandemic.

00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:00.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for the fine spirit you show

00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:03.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we all adapt to these changes.

00:08:04.504 --> 00:08:06.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier in the pandemic,

00:08:06.715 --> 00:08:09.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
we couldn’t meet together in person.

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:12.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as a result
of faithfully following the chariot,

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:15.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
we adapted and used videoconferencing

00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:17.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our meetings and ministry.

00:08:17.517 --> 00:08:21.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, circumstances are different now.

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:25.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice to be able
to meet in person again.

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:29.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in July, the Governing Body
prepared an announcement

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was read in all congregations
about attending in-person meetings.

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:38.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall some of the key points
from that announcement?

00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:41.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
The announcement began:

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:43.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In reviewing the results of resuming

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:45.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in-person congregation meetings . . . ,

00:08:45.754 --> 00:08:47.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is evident that Jehovah

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:50.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is clearly blessing this arrangement.

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:53.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We thank Jehovah
for the opportunity

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to greet our brothers
and sisters face-to-face,

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sing songs of praise
to Jehovah harmoniously,

00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:03.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and make other
appropriate expressions

00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:06.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of Christian affection once again.

00:09:06.316 --> 00:09:08.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After more than two years

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:11.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of not being able
to meet together at our Kingdom Halls,

00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:16.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have renewed appreciation
for in-person Christian meetings

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:19.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that lift our spirits
and strengthen our faith

00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:21.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
during these difficult times.”

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:25.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
The announcement continued:

00:09:25.127 --> 00:09:28.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We acknowledge
that because of advanced age,

00:09:28.463 --> 00:09:31.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
“infirmities, or other circumstances,

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:35.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“some may be limited in their ability
to attend meetings in person.

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:38.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For such ones, please keep in mind

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the loving reminder at Hebrews 6:10:

00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:45.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘God is not unrighteous
so as to forget your work

00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:48.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the love you showed for his name

00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:52.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
by ministering and continuing to minister
to the holy ones.’”

00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:57.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will never forget you
and your faithful service!

00:09:58.076 --> 00:10:00.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
You continue to show your love for his name

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you regularly attend
and participate in meetings on Zoom.

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:08.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is such an encouragement
to the congregation.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:13.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some of us
got used to doing everything on Zoom.

00:10:14.176 --> 00:10:16.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know for me,

00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:19.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
only for Jehovah would I
have done what we needed to do

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:21.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the pandemic.

00:10:21.641 --> 00:10:23.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
As soon as we could,

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy
to go back to the Kingdom Hall.

00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:29.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
There really is nothing like being together

00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:33.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers and sisters in person.

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:35.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
I appreciate that others can’t.

00:10:35.864 --> 00:10:38.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I was happy to get back to the hall.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many feel the same way.

00:10:41.786 --> 00:10:44.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear
how some of our brothers and sisters feel

00:10:44.748 --> 00:10:48.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
about being back in person
at the Kingdom Hall.

00:10:50.754 --> 00:10:52.714 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was so sad when they announced

00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:54.090 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we would stop having meetings

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the Kingdom Hall because of COVID.

00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:03.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt trapped

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:05.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I couldn’t go
to the Kingdom Hall anymore

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be fed spiritually.

00:11:09.314 --> 00:11:13.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
For two years,
the faithful slave made arrangements

00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:15.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to listen
to the meetings over the radio.

00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:22.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I did not have a radio,

00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:25.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went to different brothers’ homes
to listen to the meetings.

00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:32.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the elders arranged
to start having meetings on Zoom.

00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:34.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not have a smartphone,

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:37.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I had to go to the homes
of those in the congregation.

00:11:37.592 --> 00:11:39.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes after arriving,

00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:43.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would find out
that their Internet data bundle was used up.

00:11:43.598 --> 00:11:47.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made the pandemic very difficult for me.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:50.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I heard the news 
that “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:11:50.272 --> 00:11:53.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
decided to resume in-person meetings,

00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:56.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just so happy!

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I can see the brothers and sisters

00:12:00.782 --> 00:12:03.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I had not seen during the pandemic.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am back at the Kingdom Hall;

00:12:05.203 --> 00:12:08.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am back where I can have my spiritual food

00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:10.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way I have always enjoyed it.

00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:14.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
To not be able to go to the hall

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:15.922 line:10% position:50% align:center
was a challenge for me.

00:12:15.922 --> 00:12:17.674 line:10% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy.

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:19.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I appreciated Zoom

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we kept being fed spiritually

00:12:21.052 --> 00:12:23.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was a blessing.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
But still, I missed the people.

00:12:25.599 --> 00:12:29.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I heard we were going back in person,
I was so excited.

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:32.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was like a child going into a candy store.

00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:34.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so excited.

00:12:34.357 --> 00:12:37.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was great.
It really was energizing.

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:41.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
You felt alive again.

00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:42.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all have challenges.

00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:44.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re tired.

00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:46.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
So who doesn’t need to be energized?

00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:47.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all do.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so to come to the Kingdom Hall

00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:52.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
—there’s no question
that I am going to the meeting.

00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:57.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re with the older friends,
even older than me,

00:12:57.672 --> 00:12:59.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and younger ones.

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:02.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little children come running up to you.

00:13:02.052 --> 00:13:05.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
That just brings joy to your heart
and a smile on your face.

00:13:05.722 --> 00:13:07.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think that’s the experience

00:13:07.557 --> 00:13:10.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to have as a brotherhood.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I feel more fulfilled
by being at the Kingdom Hall.

00:13:14.648 --> 00:13:16.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m happy.

00:13:17.859 --> 00:13:21.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s heartwarming to hear their expressions.

00:13:22.155 --> 00:13:26.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve received many positive reports
about in-person meetings.

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:32.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
the Burundi branch recently wrote:

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The decision to return to in-person meetings

00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:40.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been a great blessing
to our brothers and sisters in Burundi.

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:44.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although they did what they could
to connect virtually,

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:47.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the reality was that many

00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:50.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just did not have
the circumstances to do so.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Since resuming
in-person congregation meetings,

00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:59.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our attendance has increased tremendously
throughout the country.

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:02.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For example, in one congregation,

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:05.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the attendance was 140 persons

00:14:05.073 --> 00:14:07.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when the meetings were held virtually,

00:14:07.534 --> 00:14:11.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but after resuming
in-person meetings at the Kingdom Hall,

00:14:11.287 --> 00:14:16.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
the attendance is now 227.”

00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:19.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continuing with the announcement,

00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:23.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to draw your attention
to this one comment.

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:26.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
After acknowledging those with advanced age,

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
infirmities, and other circumstances

00:14:29.514 --> 00:14:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may prevent them
from attending meetings in person,

00:14:33.309 --> 00:14:38.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
the announcement
included this thought-provoking statement:

00:14:38.565 --> 00:14:42.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the other hand,
some brothers and sisters

00:14:42.026 --> 00:14:44.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—younger and in good health—

00:14:44.863 --> 00:14:47.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have more favorable circumstances

00:14:47.907 --> 00:14:52.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that may allow them
to attend Christian meetings regularly

00:14:52.203 --> 00:14:54.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at the Kingdom Hall.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, it has been observed

00:14:57.167 --> 00:14:59.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that some
have developed a tendency

00:14:59.586 --> 00:15:02.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to attend meetings
on a videoconference when,

00:15:02.922 --> 00:15:05.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to their circumstances,

00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:08.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
they could be physically
at the Kingdom Hall.”

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:12.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the announcement said.

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:16.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s something we can continue to reflect on.

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:18.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
The chariot is moving!

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re getting ready
for in-person circuit assemblies

00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:24.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and regional conventions.

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:26.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now is an excellent time

00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:31.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
to evaluate our attitude
about in-person meetings.

00:15:32.452 --> 00:15:37.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we appreciate
that some cannot attend in person.

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:41.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on the other hand, maybe some could.

00:15:41.711 --> 00:15:44.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will help each of us
to honestly evaluate

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:46.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
our personal circumstances?

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:52.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the announcement
drew our attention to three verses

00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:56.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
that express Jehovah’s thinking
on this important matter.

00:15:57.852 --> 00:16:00.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read just one of those verses

00:16:00.522 --> 00:16:03.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 22:22:

00:16:04.484 --> 00:16:07.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will declare your name to my brothers;

00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the midst of the congregation
I will praise you.”

00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:14.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
How we cherish our opportunities

00:16:14.828 --> 00:16:17.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be “in the midst of the congregation”

00:16:17.413 --> 00:16:19.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
at in-person meetings!

00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:23.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
The announcement
concluded by saying:

00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:28.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Strong faith and endurance
are required

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:32.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to face deteriorating
world conditions.

00:16:32.053 --> 00:16:34.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, we take this opportunity

00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:36.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to warmly commend you
dear brothers and sisters

00:16:36.975 --> 00:16:41.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for your faithfulness, love,
and heartful desire

00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:44.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to praise
our glorious God, Jehovah.

00:16:44.983 --> 00:16:47.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you very much!”

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:50.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Ukraine

00:16:50.697 --> 00:16:54.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
have faced
especially challenging circumstances

00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:57.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to holding in-person meetings.

00:16:57.954 --> 00:17:02.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, approximately
100 congregations in Ukraine

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
were approved to resume in-person meetings

00:17:06.254 --> 00:17:09.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it was safe to do so.

00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:13.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters
responded enthusiastically.

00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:19.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice some of their expressions,
which highlight the joy and benefits

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
of in-person meetings.

00:17:22.812 --> 00:17:26.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister named Svitlana says:

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:30.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the announcement was read
about the return to in-person meetings,

00:17:30.153 --> 00:17:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the first thing I did

00:17:32.196 --> 00:17:36.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was thank Jehovah in fervent prayer.

00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Meetings at the Kingdom Hall
refresh and give emotional strength.

00:17:41.497 --> 00:17:43.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The hugs and conversations

00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:48.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
“improve my mood
and give me the needed support.

00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:53.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is especially the case
after spending hours in basements

00:17:53.092 --> 00:17:56.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hearing bombs explode.”

00:17:57.889 --> 00:18:00.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nadia states:

00:18:00.016 --> 00:18:02.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I compare online meetings

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to rescue boats helping us to stay afloat.

00:18:06.397 --> 00:18:08.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Attending in-person meetings

00:18:08.441 --> 00:18:12.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“feels like being aboard a huge cruise ship.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The war is taking an emotional
and physical toll on all of us,

00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but when I am in the Kingdom Hall,

00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
I forget about my problems,
my worries, and even the war.”

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Stanislav
who got baptized during the pandemic

00:18:29.337 --> 00:18:34.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
without ever having attended
a meeting at the Kingdom Hall says:

00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:39.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a modern person
and found our Zoom meetings OK.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I did not expect that the atmosphere

00:18:42.934 --> 00:18:46.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the Kingdom Hall
would be so overwhelming.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I also find it easier to follow

00:18:49.315 --> 00:18:52.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
the presented material and to remember it.”

00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:57.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re encouraged by the determination

00:18:57.198 --> 00:18:59.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters in Ukraine

00:18:59.492 --> 00:19:01.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend in-person meetings

00:19:01.786 --> 00:19:05.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the many challenges they face.

00:19:05.915 --> 00:19:10.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their expressions
echo the words of Psalm 122:1:

00:19:11.379 --> 00:19:14.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I rejoiced when they said to me:

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Let us go to the house of Jehovah.’”

00:19:18.136 --> 00:19:20.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have we learned from this update?

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve seen from Ezekiel’s vision,

00:19:23.474 --> 00:19:26.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must always be ready to adapt

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah’s chariot moves.

00:19:29.355 --> 00:19:32.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do so not only by attending meetings

00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:34.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and participating in the field ministry

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also by staying up-to-date

00:19:36.988 --> 00:19:40.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our spiritual feeding program.

00:19:40.366 --> 00:19:43.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
By keeping pace with Jehovah’s chariot,

00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:47.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show that we respect
and have confidence in Jehovah.

00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:52.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
we enjoy what is stated

00:19:52.378 --> 00:19:55.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 29:11:

00:19:55.923 --> 00:19:58.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will give strength to his people.

00:19:58.676 --> 00:20:02.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will bless his people with peace.”

00:20:02.889 --> 00:20:06.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, by being part of Jehovah’s organization,

00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
we share in the strength and peace

00:20:09.812 --> 00:20:13.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
that only he can provide.

00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:18.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all continue to adapt
as Jehovah’s chariot moves

00:20:18.071 --> 00:20:21.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy his rich blessing.

00:20:22.366 --> 00:20:25.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
