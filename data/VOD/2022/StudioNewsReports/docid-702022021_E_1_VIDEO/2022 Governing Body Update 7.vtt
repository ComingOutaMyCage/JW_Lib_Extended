00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:04.187 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome, dear brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:08.525 line:10% position:50% align:center
In this program, it’s my pleasure

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:10.226 line:10% position:50% align:center
to share reports

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:13.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our in-person activities.

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll also provide updates

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our disaster relief efforts.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, finally,

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:24.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
in view of the rapidly changing world scene,

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:26.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll discuss the need

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:28.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
for decisive action

00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:33.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we are confronted
with dangerous circumstances.

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:38.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since September 1, 2022,

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:40.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve resumed

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
the house-to-house ministry.

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:47.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we also had a worldwide campaign

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:50.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer Bible studies,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
using the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  brochure.

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:58.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many honesthearted ones are responding

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this “good news of something better.”

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:06.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since our last update,

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:09.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was announced that as of October 1,

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are no longer
strongly recommending mask wearing

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:17.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
while attending in-person meetings.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
So unless it’s a governmental requirement,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is a personal choice

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether to wear a mask while participating

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:29.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
in theocratic activities.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
We respect the individual decisions

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters on this matter.

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:40.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
This direction will also apply

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our in-person theocratic schools,

00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:46.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
circuit assemblies,

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:50.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
and regional conventions when they resume

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 2023.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
By January 1, 2023,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it is Jehovah’s will,

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:02.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
we hope to have returned to most

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our prepandemic arrangements,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:10.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony
with local governmental regulations.

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:13.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are some activities

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have not yet been approved to resume,

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:20.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Bethel tours and guests.

00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about beyond January 1?

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:28.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re excited to inform you

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
that, Jehovah willing,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll resume in-person special conventions

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting January 1, 2024.

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:45.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
More information
on the specific locations and dates

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:47.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be announced soon.

00:02:49.452 --> 00:02:51.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very happy to share these

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:54.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
positive developments with you.

00:02:56.793 --> 00:03:00.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic, tragically,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of us have lost loved ones

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
to COVID-19.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, others have lost loved ones
because of war,

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:14.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters,

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:18.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other painful circumstances.

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:20.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent times,

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:23.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely you’ve shared
the Bible’s message of comfort

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:26.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a coworker,

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
a neighbor, or a relative.

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:33.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help us in such situations,

00:03:33.263 --> 00:03:37.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re pleased to announce the release

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a new video.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:42.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is entitled 

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:46.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Comfort for Those Who Mourn.</i>

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:49.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re confident that this video

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be a valuable tool

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:56.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us
comfort our relatives and other acquaintances

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even those who may not be

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
religiously inclined.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:06.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy watching this comforting video.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our family and friends are precious to us.

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:17.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
They show us love.

00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:20.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are there when we need them.

00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:24.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we lose a loved one in death,

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:30.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want comfort
from someone who understands.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:36.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
God and his Son, Jesus, understand.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
While on earth,

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:44.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus experienced the pain
of losing family and friends.

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:48.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the death
of a close friend named Lazarus,

00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:51.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ grief was intense.

00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:54.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felt what others felt.

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
The pain was crushing.

00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:00.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, his empathy

00:05:00.183 --> 00:05:02.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
moved him to comfort others.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:07.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, he wanted to do more.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus spoke with his Father
and brought his friend back to life.

00:05:14.163 --> 00:05:18.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God and Jesus have not changed.

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:20.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
They feel pain when people die.

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:24.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
They feel your pain

00:05:24.173 --> 00:05:27.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have promised to eliminate death.

00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:30.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[God] will swallow up death forever . . .

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:32.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will wipe away the tears

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all faces.”

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus also gave
this beautiful promise for the future.

00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:42.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be amazed at this,

00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:44.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the hour is coming

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in which all those in the memorial tombs

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
will hear his voice and come out.”

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
A special magazine entitled

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:55.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Help for Those Who Grieve”

00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:57.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been prepared to provide comfort.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.944 line:90% position:50% align:center

and hope that this message
will provide you comfort

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this difficult time.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:46.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also have some updates

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:50.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our disaster relief efforts.

00:06:50.093 --> 00:06:53.329 line:10% position:50% align:center
As reported on JW News,

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:56.299 line:10% position:50% align:center
Hurricanes Fiona and Ian

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:59.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
have affected our brothers and sisters

00:06:59.302 --> 00:07:04.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Caribbean and in parts
of Canada and the United States.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, one brother in Cuba died.

00:07:10.947 --> 00:07:13.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Between the two storms,

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:18.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 3,600 of our brothers’ homes

00:07:18.154 --> 00:07:20.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 100 Kingdom Halls

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:24.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
were damaged or destroyed.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:28.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch offices
are working hard to provide assistance

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:32.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual encouragement.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:37.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all those affected by natural disasters

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for all those who are providing relief.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:46.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may also be wondering,

00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:50.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How are our brothers
in Ukraine and Russia doing?’

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since February,

00:07:53.322 --> 00:07:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 26,000 brothers and sisters

00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:59.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
have chosen to flee areas affected

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:02.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the war in Ukraine.

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:05.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of recent events,

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:09.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
thousands of people are fleeing Russia.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes some of our brothers.

00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:17.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the outset,
some thought the war might last

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:21.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
for only a few weeks or months.

00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:23.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is not the case.

00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:28.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have fled the war to another country,

00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:33.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
please know
that we want to help you to regain

00:08:33.162 --> 00:08:36.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sense of normalcy in your lives 

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:39.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
as soon as possible.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:43.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we doing to assist?

00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:46.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s watch the following report

00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:49.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Central Europe branch.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:51.914 line:10% position:50% align:center
In our branch territory,

00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:54.684 line:10% position:50% align:center
over 8,500 brothers and sisters

00:08:54.684 --> 00:08:56.619 line:10% position:50% align:center
arrived as refugees.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.788 line:10% position:50% align:center
In March, the Coordinators’ Committee

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
directed that we appoint case monitors

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work under the direction
 of Disaster Relief Committees.

00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:07.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Case monitors work along with elders

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:09.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help individuals and families

00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:11.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain their spiritual routine

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:14.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
and become self-sufficient.

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:18.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some publishers have been able
to make personal arrangements

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:21.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
to obtain accommodations and employment.

00:09:21.077 --> 00:09:24.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others have been able to benefit
from government programs.

00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:28.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have found that the sooner
we can help our brothers

00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get settled into their own home,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find employment,
and to associate with a local congregation,

00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:38.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sooner they feel a sense of normalcy.

00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:40.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
This benefits them spiritually,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
physically, and emotionally.

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:47.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is really blessing these efforts.

00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:08.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s encouraging to hear

00:11:08.284 --> 00:11:11.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
how so many are working hard

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help our refugee brothers

00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:17.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
get back to a more normal life.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re so proud of our refugee brothers

00:11:21.497 --> 00:11:23.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being flexible

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:27.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for having realistic expectations.

00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:33.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also working to assist
various branch offices around the world,

00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:35.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially in Europe,

00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be better equipped to deal

00:11:37.413 --> 00:11:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
with potential energy shortages.

00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:45.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may be in the form
of adding solar panels,

00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:49.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
generators, and battery backups.

00:11:51.093 --> 00:11:54.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help branches
to continue their vital work

00:11:54.697 --> 00:11:57.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
of delivering spiritual food

00:11:57.533 --> 00:12:00.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and giving support and direction

00:12:00.503 --> 00:12:02.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
to congregation activities.

00:12:05.608 --> 00:12:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, for the next few minutes,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s discuss the theme

00:12:10.513 --> 00:12:15.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When You See Danger, Act Quickly!”

00:12:17.253 --> 00:12:19.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you’d agree

00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the scene of this world is changing.”

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:28.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
The relative stability we’ve experienced
in various parts of the world

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:33.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
seems to be rapidly disappearing.

00:12:34.403 --> 00:12:37.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many natural disasters,

00:12:37.973 --> 00:12:41.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
increased unrest, war,

00:12:41.544 --> 00:12:43.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
threats of food shortages,

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:47.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
energy shortages, and more.

00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
What should we do

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:53.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we are personally confronted

00:12:53.622 --> 00:12:55.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
with such dangers?

00:12:55.624 --> 00:12:59.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, please turn with me
to Proverbs chapter 22,

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read together verse number 3.

00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:09.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The shrewd one sees the danger

00:13:09.772 --> 00:13:12.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and conceals himself,

00:13:12.842 --> 00:13:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the inexperienced keep right on going

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suffer the consequences.”

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, when we see danger,

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re wise to conceal ourselves.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we must act quickly!

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is true now,
and it was true in Bible times too.

00:13:35.664 --> 00:13:37.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider a few examples.

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:43.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David faced threats of attack
from Saul or others,

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:48.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
he quickly got up and ran away.

00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:51.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first century,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s angel told Joseph

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:57.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take newborn Jesus and Mary

00:13:57.286 --> 00:14:01.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
and flee to Egypt because

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Herod is about to search

00:14:05.027 --> 00:14:08.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the young child to kill him.”

00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:11.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Joseph and Mary

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:14.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
left that night.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:19.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, Jesus told Christians

00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:22.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
to flee when they saw Jerusalem

00:14:22.411 --> 00:14:25.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
surrounded by armies.

00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:29.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that at Luke chapter 21,

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:33.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read together
verses 20 and 21:

00:14:34.657 --> 00:14:38.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, when you see Jerusalem

00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:41.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“surrounded by encamped armies,

00:14:41.263 --> 00:14:45.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then know that the desolating of her

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:48.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has drawn near.

00:14:48.037 --> 00:14:50.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then let those in Judea

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:54.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“begin fleeing to the mountains,

00:14:54.743 --> 00:14:59.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let those in the midst of her leave,

00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:01.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let those in the countryside

00:15:01.884 --> 00:15:04.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
not enter into her.”

00:15:05.854 --> 00:15:07.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we see danger,

00:15:10.292 --> 00:15:12.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t need to panic,

00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:17.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do need to act quickly.

00:15:17.099 --> 00:15:20.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
That may mean fleeing the area where we live

00:15:20.869 --> 00:15:23.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saying goodbye to some

00:15:23.272 --> 00:15:26.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even all of our possessions.

00:15:27.543 --> 00:15:31.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our brothers and sisters
in Ukraine and Russia

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
are facing this question:

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should I flee because of the war?

00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:44.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can be
a very difficult decision to make.

00:15:44.927 --> 00:15:48.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unless the government directs us to flee,

00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:51.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a personal decision.

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:55.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not expect Jesus or an angel

00:15:55.104 --> 00:15:57.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
to tell us to leave.

00:15:57.706 --> 00:16:00.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah does expect us

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:03.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use our “power of reason.”

00:16:03.445 --> 00:16:07.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants us to act wisely.

00:16:07.816 --> 00:16:11.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how one family from Ukraine

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:14.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
responded when they realized

00:16:14.356 --> 00:16:16.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were in danger.

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:23.332 line:10% position:50% align:center
Even before the war started,

00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:25.968 line:10% position:50% align:center
there had been warnings.

00:16:25.968 --> 00:16:27.636 line:10% position:50% align:center
We had family worship

00:16:27.636 --> 00:16:30.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
and studied an article
from the <i>Awake!</i>  magazine.

00:16:31.674 --> 00:16:34.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a lot of advice
about emergency kits

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
and having a plan of what you will do.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
We made a firm decision that if war broke out

00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:44.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there were explosions, we would not stay.

00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:48.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one of us
had our own emergency kit ready.

00:16:48.824 --> 00:16:52.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had put them in the hallway
before everything started.

00:16:52.327 --> 00:16:54.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told the children:

00:16:54.296 --> 00:16:58.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Aside from your backpack,
take only what you really need.”

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each child took only one extra change
of clothes, and that’s it.

00:17:02.504 --> 00:17:06.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we had filled up the tank in the car.

00:17:06.308 --> 00:17:10.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up to that moment, before the war,
we had never had a full tank.

00:17:10.145 --> 00:17:14.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought, ‘Let there never be war,
but at least we’ll have a full tank.’

00:17:14.016 --> 00:17:16.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were ready and waiting, but what next?

00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:19.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it safe to go or not?

00:17:19.054 --> 00:17:22.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders called and told me
to weigh the pros and cons.

00:17:22.658 --> 00:17:25.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then there was an explosion.

00:17:25.394 --> 00:17:28.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
The windows and the doors shook,
and I thought,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘No, we have to leave; that will be safer.’

00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:35.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the whole family
—me, my wife, and our five children—

00:17:35.404 --> 00:17:37.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
took our backpacks to the car.

00:17:37.906 --> 00:17:41.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took us just a few minutes
to get the car ready.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we were leaving,
all the gas stations

00:17:44.747 --> 00:17:47.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
were crowded and there were huge queues.

00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:52.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our tank was full, so we only had to fill up
again near the border.

00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:56.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were at the border for 21 hours.

00:17:56.391 --> 00:17:59.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took 21 hours
moving the car little by little.

00:18:00.562 --> 00:18:03.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time and again we are convinced

00:18:03.298 --> 00:18:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s advice is always for the best

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:10.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even if we don’t understand why,
we should follow it always—

00:18:10.906 --> 00:18:13.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that obedience brings blessings.

00:18:13.442 --> 00:18:15.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how it works.

00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:29.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being prepared allowed them

00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:33.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the personal decision
to leave quickly

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they saw the danger.

00:18:36.064 --> 00:18:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahead of time,
they obediently followed the direction 

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:45.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have go bags
and a full tank of gas in the car.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:18:49.778 --> 00:18:53.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the instability of the world,

00:18:53.515 --> 00:18:56.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to be prepared mentally,

00:18:56.618 --> 00:18:59.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
physically, and spiritually

00:18:59.087 --> 00:19:01.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
for disasters

00:19:01.123 --> 00:19:05.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rapidly changing circumstances.

00:19:05.194 --> 00:19:09.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, it’s affecting these brothers,

00:19:09.598 --> 00:19:14.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
but tomorrow it may be affecting us.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can be sure

00:19:16.872 --> 00:19:21.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we will all stand together
and help one another

00:19:21.343 --> 00:19:25.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
through whatever challenges we may face.

00:19:25.314 --> 00:19:30.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a time for us to support one another.

00:19:30.118 --> 00:19:32.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, really, relief work

00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:37.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a vital part of our sacred service.

00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:42.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Acts chapter 11.

00:19:42.297 --> 00:19:47.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to take a look
at verses 28 and 29:

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:51.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One of them named Agabus

00:19:51.473 --> 00:19:54.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“stood up and foretold through the spirit

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that a great famine

00:19:57.212 --> 00:20:01.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was about to come
on the entire inhabited earth,

00:20:01.717 --> 00:20:06.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which, in fact, did take place
in the time of Claudius.

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the disciples determined,

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:12.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each according to what he could afford,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to send relief

00:20:14.196 --> 00:20:17.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the brothers living in Judea.”

00:20:19.001 --> 00:20:22.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note on verse 29

00:20:22.204 --> 00:20:24.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us appreciate

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:27.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “this is the first recorded instance

00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:31.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of Christians sending relief aid
to fellow Christians

00:20:31.847 --> 00:20:35.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
living in another part of the world.”

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note goes on to explain:

00:20:38.387 --> 00:20:42.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Greek word <i>di·a·ko·ni</i><i>ʹ</i><i>a,</i>

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“often rendered ‘ministry,’

00:20:45.093 --> 00:20:49.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is also used in the sense of ‘relief work’

00:20:49.264 --> 00:20:52.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at Ac 12:25

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and ‘relief ministry’ at 2Co 8:4.

00:20:56.705 --> 00:21:00.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The use of the Greek word <i>di·a·ko·ni</i><i>ʹ</i><i>a</i>

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:07.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“shows that Christians
have a twofold ministry.

00:21:08.417 --> 00:21:12.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One aspect is . . .
the preaching and teaching work.

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The other aspect involves their ministry

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:20.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in behalf of fellow believers,
as mentioned here.

00:21:20.495 --> 00:21:25.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul . . . showed that these
different aspects of the Christian ministry

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
all constitute ‘sacred service.’”

00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:33.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we see that relief work

00:21:33.608 --> 00:21:36.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
is sacred service.

00:21:36.278 --> 00:21:40.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is a vital part of our ministry.

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:44.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
We often say thank you,

00:21:44.953 --> 00:21:47.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we want you to know

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:50.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
how very much we appreciate

00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:53.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you are generously supporting

00:21:53.662 --> 00:21:55.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
our relief efforts.

00:21:55.864 --> 00:21:58.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re providing food

00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:01.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rebuilding homes and Kingdom Halls.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
When refugees come,

00:22:03.805 --> 00:22:07.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re welcoming them at border crossings

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:10.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and into your homes.

00:22:10.078 --> 00:22:12.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re helping our brothers

00:22:12.681 --> 00:22:15.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
rebuild their lives

00:22:15.617 --> 00:22:18.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and providing them what they need.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of this is greatly needed

00:22:22.824 --> 00:22:26.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deeply appreciated.

00:22:26.228 --> 00:22:29.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for what you’re doing.

00:22:29.664 --> 00:22:31.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please know

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we love you all very much.

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:42.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
