Welcome to JW Broadcasting®
for December 2022!

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.342 line:10% position:50% align:center
On September 10th,

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:28.211 line:10% position:50% align:center
24 students reached a milestone

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:31.648 line:10% position:50% align:center
and graduated from the 152nd class of Gilead.

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:35.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of the students
were initially invited to attend the school,

00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:39.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they patiently waited
until COVID-19 restrictions eased.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, after five months of intensive study,

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
how will they apply their training?

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:48.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can they succeed in their assignments?

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:51.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can they strengthen
their brothers and sisters?

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:53.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
These questions and more are answered

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Part 1 of this Gilead graduation program.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this day has arrived for you students.

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:06.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see you there smiling
and looking forward to this program.

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:11.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure it’s hard for you to believe
that we’ve actually gotten to graduation day.

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:17.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also know that you’re very keen
and enthusiastic to get to your assignments,

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:19.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether you’re going back
to where you came from

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you’re going to a new assignment.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:25.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the last few months,
you’ve learned so much, haven’t you?

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:30.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve crammed that information
into your mind and heart,

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now you have that ready to implement it

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you go to your assignments.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need to be careful

00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:42.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to be enthusiastic,
keen, and zealous,

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also we need to be patient.

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’d like to talk to you
for a few moments about this theme

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:54.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Enthusiastic but Be Patient” as well.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why so?

00:01:56.065 --> 00:02:00.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you go to your assignments
with all this that you’ve learned,

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:05.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to be tempted
to try and implement it everywhere.

00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:09.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember, you’re not going to change
the whole world in one day

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:11.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even the whole branch.

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:16.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,
it’s so easy to become overwhelmed

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:20.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we try to take on too much
all at one time.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:23.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s why it’s important
to be enthusiastic

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:26.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also patient.

00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:31.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Lord Jesus Christ
was an excellent example of this.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus came into the world,

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
the whole world needed to hear his message.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:40.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, he had to wait some 30 years,

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:45.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
growing up according to Jehovah’s timetable,
before he started his ministry.

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:48.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that took patience on his part, didn’t it?

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about when Jesus
started his ministry?

00:02:53.122 --> 00:02:55.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was his focus?

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can imagine him looking around,

00:02:57.293 --> 00:03:01.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing all the things that needed to be done
in the world at that point.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s turn in our Bibles.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:07.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to Matthew chapter 15

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:10.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 15:24,

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:14.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here Jesus said to his apostles:

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was not sent to anyone

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
except to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.”

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:23.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s interesting.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus here mentions
he had a specific, limited assignment.

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:30.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the assignment?

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
To go “to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.”

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:37.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you turn back
just a couple of chapters,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
in chapter 10 of Matthew,

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:44.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll notice in verses 5 and 6
that when Jesus sent out his apostles,

00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:46.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did he say to them?

00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:50.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not go off into the road of the nations,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not enter any Samaritan city;

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but instead, go continually

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:00.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:04.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as Jesus sent out his apostles

00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:06.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this particular instance,

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:09.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was he reminding them of?

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:11.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was telling them

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:14.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they likewise had a limited assignment,

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:16.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
a specific assignment.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
They weren’t supposed to try

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:19.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do everything all at once

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to go to the Samaritans and to the Gentiles.

00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:23.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were to focus

00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:25.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
just on “the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:29.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we think about this,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do we learn from these two verses?

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, the whole world
needed to hear the message.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:42.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jesus do,
and what did he expect of his apostles?

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:47.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
That they would recognize
that they had a specific assignment.

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:49.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
They weren’t to be overwhelmed

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:53.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
by trying to think of changing
the whole world at that point.

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:56.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus showed great trust in Jehovah.

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:01.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that Jehovah
would gradually expand the message

00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:04.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reach of the message.

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:07.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, we realize
that at Pentecost there was an expansion

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then in 36 C.E., another expansion.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does that mean for you?

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, when you return to your assignment
or you go to the new one,

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:22.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s going to be
an endless number of possibilities

00:05:22.638 --> 00:05:25.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you can help others

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:28.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to stabilize and strengthen everyone.

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:31.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you try to take everything on at once,

00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:33.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to wear yourself out

00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:36.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and probably wear out
a whole lot of other people as well.

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:41.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know the English idiom
“Don’t bite off more than you can chew.”

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:46.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, gradually do the things
that Jehovah has assigned you to do.

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:50.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you try to be too broad in what you do,

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may end up not accomplishing much at all

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
except just wearing yourself out.

00:05:55.638 --> 00:05:58.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
But be patient just as Jesus was,

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:02.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
and recognize that each one of you
will have a specific assignment.

00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:05.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then try to work at that,

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:07.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting that Jehovah will allow

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
your good example to benefit others,

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gradually the effects of your work
will spread to others.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:19.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, an example of this is
in the South Pacific,

00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:21.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
if I could just tell you about that now.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
When missionaries arrived
in the South Pacific—

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take, for example,

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:28.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might end up in a country

00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:31.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has 100 inhabited islands.

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:33.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re a new missionary.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember the feeling.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:39.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then you find out
there are only ten islands

00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:41.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have Jehovah’s Witnesses on them

00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:45.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
—ten islands that have
publishers and congregations.

00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:47.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there are 90 that don’t.

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:51.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you think
the normal enthusiastic response is?

00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:54.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, let’s get a boat.
We have to get a boat!

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We must visit all the 90 islands.

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, that needs to be done now, immediately!”

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:04.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, usually you’re assigned
to one congregation

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:06.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
in one area.

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:07.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s the point?

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
What normally happens?

00:07:09.712 --> 00:07:11.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you see, if you were to get a boat

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:13.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and there’s nothing wrong
with getting a boat

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
or visiting other islands)

00:07:15.318 --> 00:07:19.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if that becomes your focus
and you neglect your assignment,

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:23.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can you follow up on all the interest
that you may find on those 90 islands?

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:26.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not just enough
to go and give them some magazines,

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you need to be there with them,

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:32.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
build them up,
and form congregations.

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:34.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
So normally what happens?

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s amazing to see
missionaries and others

00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:42.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
who work in maybe larger city areas;

00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:45.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
they work diligently at their assignments.

00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:48.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then maybe others from different islands

00:07:48.818 --> 00:07:52.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
come to visit that city
the missionaries are in,

00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:53.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they get contacted.

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:55.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
They show an interest, they start to study,

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they return to their home islands.

00:07:58.494 --> 00:07:59.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what happens?

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:03.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gradually, the work spreads out
to all these islands.

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:05.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t feel
that you have to take on everything.

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:13.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Focus as Jesus did
on the limited assignment you have.

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then along the way,
you may be surprised at what happens.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:22.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s exactly what happened to Jesus.

00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:26.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to Matthew chapter 15.

00:08:26.489 --> 00:08:30.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,
what was the assignment that Jesus had?

00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:32.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 24,

00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:34.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
he mentioned “Israel.”

00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:38.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, looking at this map, we see at that time

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:42.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was actually a border around that area

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:45.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we could say was his territory assignment.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Jesus said these words,

00:08:48.477 --> 00:08:49.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
where was he?

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember?

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look in verse 21:

00:08:53.282 --> 00:08:55.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus now went into the region

00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:57.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Tyre and Sidon.”

00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:00.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you look at the map,

00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
where was Tyre and Sidon?

00:09:03.593 --> 00:09:04.694 line:10% position:50% align:center
What do you notice?

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:07.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
You see, he wasn’t in his territory.

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:09.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
He was out among the Gentiles.

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:12.034 line:10% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:09:12.034 --> 00:09:14.337 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, when we look at the parallel account

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:16.973 line:10% position:50% align:center
that’s mentioned in Mark chapter 7,

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:21.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
it tells us that Jesus wanted
some time alone with his apostles,

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
some downtime
because there were so many crowds;

00:09:24.513 --> 00:09:25.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were so busy.

00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:29.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’m sure all of us
can understand that feeling Jesus had.

00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:32.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he took them out of that general area

00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this territory

00:09:34.957 --> 00:09:37.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was beyond what he
would normally preach in

00:09:37.593 --> 00:09:39.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have some quiet time together.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happened?

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:45.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the account tells us
that there was a Syrophoenician woman,

00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:47.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps (as the study notes help us to see)

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a Greek background

00:09:49.972 --> 00:09:51.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far as her nationality went,

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:54.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maybe she was a citizen

00:09:54.377 --> 00:09:56.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an inhabitant of that area,

00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:58.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Syrophoenician area.

00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:02.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this woman approached Jesus,
pleading with him.

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:05.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, she didn’t look like a Jewish person.

00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
She probably didn’t even speak Hebrew.

00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:11.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
She certainly wasn’t in the category

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the lost ones of the house of Israel.

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:16.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus,

00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:19.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
initially when she started
to make these efforts to talk to him,

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:23.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned this to his apostles in verse 24:

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:25.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘That’s our assignment.’

00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:28.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice that this was a little different

00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:31.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the sense that this woman

00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:34.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed an appreciation for who Jesus was.

00:10:34.984 --> 00:10:38.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in verse 22, she said:

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:42.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David.”

00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:45.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a Gentile woman.

00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:47.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should she really know who David was?

00:10:47.963 --> 00:10:50.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by saying “Son of David,”

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:54.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the study note indicates,
perhaps she was showing faith

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the fact that Jesus is the Messiah.

00:10:58.274 --> 00:11:01.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she wasn’t
your average Syrophoenician person.

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:03.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jesus do?

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he tested her a little.

00:11:05.648 --> 00:11:09.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did emphasize
the fact that in a household

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
you first of all
feed the children, the family,

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the little dogs get fed afterward.

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:18.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps he was playing on words there.

00:11:18.327 --> 00:11:19.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting.

00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:22.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re not sure
what language Jesus was speaking to her. 

00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:24.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  did say that Jesus

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps did understand Greek
and use it at times.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, his apostles
obviously understood some Greek.

00:11:30.873 --> 00:11:33.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wrote some of the books of the Bible
in Greek.

00:11:33.876 --> 00:11:37.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever the case,
the record of this is written

00:11:37.713 --> 00:11:39.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the inspired record—
in Greek,

00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:42.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it uses this term “little dogs.”

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was that offensive?

00:11:44.653 --> 00:11:45.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:11:45.554 --> 00:11:48.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it’s mentioned,
it was an affectionate term

00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:51.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
like saying “puppies” or “pets.”

00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:53.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever the case,

00:11:53.896 --> 00:11:57.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
he must have looked very friendly,
perhaps had a smile on his face,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she was not deterred.

00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:02.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Jesus’ reaction?

00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:05.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he acknowledged
his territory, his assignment.

00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:08.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then in verse 28, he said,

00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:10.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O woman, great is your faith;

00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:14.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
let it happen to you as you wish.”

00:12:15.351 --> 00:12:18.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this the only time
that Jesus did something like this

00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:20.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a non-Jewish person?

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember in John chapter 4,

00:12:23.592 --> 00:12:26.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only do we have this case
of the Syrophoenician woman,

00:12:26.762 --> 00:12:30.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in John chapter 4,
we’re told about the Samaritan woman.

00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:34.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
This non-Jewish person was witnessed to,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then even members of her village

00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:41.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
accepted Jesus as the Messiah.

00:12:41.577 --> 00:12:45.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then what about the Roman army officer

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus was able to help?

00:12:47.116 --> 00:12:48.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus mentioned

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he hadn’t even seen

00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:52.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
that type of faith in all of Israel.

00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:57.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what lesson do we learn from this?

00:12:57.493 --> 00:13:00.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus focused on his assignment.

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:04.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always acknowledged
what he was assigned to do.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when opportunities came up along the way

00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:13.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help those
who weren’t necessarily in his assignment,

00:13:13.108 --> 00:13:14.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still gave them some help

00:13:14.844 --> 00:13:18.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they were genuine persons
who needed help.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:23.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, although Jesus realized
it wasn’t yet the time to expand the work,

00:13:23.118 --> 00:13:26.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was willing to reach out
to these ones as well.

00:13:27.323 --> 00:13:30.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the lesson for all of us?

00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:35.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you go to your assignments,
you will have specific assignments.

00:13:35.264 --> 00:13:38.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if it’s in a Bethel or in the field,

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:41.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll know what your assignment is.

00:13:41.303 --> 00:13:44.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
So don’t start looking
at all the other assignments that are around

00:13:44.773 --> 00:13:47.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how you can help them
and what you need to do

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say, “Oh, why don’t they change?”

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:52.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, you’ve changed a lot
in the last few months;

00:13:52.147 --> 00:13:54.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
but remember, they haven’t.

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they survived without you.

00:13:59.154 --> 00:14:01.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the key?

00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:05.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Focus on your assignment.

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:08.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be zealous, be enthusiastic,

00:14:08.063 --> 00:14:10.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also be patient.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, have trust in Jehovah

00:14:13.168 --> 00:14:16.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if you focus on your assignment,
you work hard,

00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:20.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
you take up whatever opportunities
come your way along the way,

00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:22.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you can be sure you will be blessed

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:26.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you’re enthusiastic but also patient.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now with those thoughts in mind,

00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:38.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a very interesting program
ahead of us.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
First up, we have Brother Kenneth Cook,
a member of the Governing Body.

00:14:41.997 --> 00:14:45.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Cook
is going to talk to you on the theme

00:14:45.234 --> 00:14:48.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Steps That Lead to Blessings.”

00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:49.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Cook, please.

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:59.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin, I’d like to share
a personal experience with you.

00:15:00.783 --> 00:15:05.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was told that I was appointed to be
a member of the Governing Body,

00:15:05.754 --> 00:15:07.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the brothers who informed me said:

00:15:09.224 --> 00:15:11.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With this assignment, you’ll experience

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:14.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a great increase in responsibility.

00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:17.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But you’ll also see a corresponding increase

00:15:17.866 --> 00:15:20.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in Jehovah’s spirit to help you.

00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:22.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will not be too much for you.”

00:15:23.872 --> 00:15:28.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those words were very,
very reassuring to me.

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:31.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the fact is that all of us

00:15:31.614 --> 00:15:34.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
(no matter who we are)
serving Jehovah faithfully

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:37.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
must rely on his help

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:40.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to succeed in serving him.

00:15:40.055 --> 00:15:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how do we show this
and receive his help?

00:15:43.726 --> 00:15:45.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are a number of ways.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:47.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to focus on three of them.

00:15:47.563 --> 00:15:51.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are these: Follow direction, show faith,

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:55.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
and use common sense,
or the thinking ability,

00:15:55.437 --> 00:15:57.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given to us.

00:15:57.573 --> 00:15:59.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s consider the first step.

00:16:00.576 --> 00:16:05.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes all that’s required
to receive Jehovah’s blessing on our work

00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:08.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to follow simple, clear direction.

00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:10.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a Bible example of that.

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:13.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found in Mark chapter 14

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark chapter 14.

00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:17.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you’ll recall from this account

00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:21.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s Son directed two of his disciples

00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:25.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go into Jerusalem and to prepare a large,

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:28.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
furnished upper room for the Passover.

00:16:28.137 --> 00:16:30.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
His directions were specific.

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, Jesus said that they would meet

00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:36.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘a man carrying a large, earthenware jar,

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:38.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were to follow him.’

00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:43.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then starting in verse 14,
Jesus added this,

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “Wherever he goes inside,
say to the master of the house,

00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:50.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The Teacher says: “Where is the guest room

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:53.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where I may eat
the Passover with my disciples?”’

00:16:53.862 --> 00:16:57.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he will show you a large upper room,
furnished and ready.

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:59.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Prepare it for us there.

00:16:59.201 --> 00:17:02.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the disciples went out,
and they entered the city

00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:05.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and found it just as he said to them,

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they prepared for the Passover.”

00:17:09.211 --> 00:17:12.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the directions were simple, right?

00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:14.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were told where they should go,

00:17:14.883 --> 00:17:17.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
who they should follow,
what they were to say,

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they were to do.

00:17:19.488 --> 00:17:22.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the two disciples promptly followed
that direction,

00:17:22.925 --> 00:17:27.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of course, their obedience
brought many blessings, as we know.

00:17:27.696 --> 00:17:31.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what practical lesson
can you draw from this?

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson: Sometimes all that is needed
in serving Jehovah

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to follow simple, clear direction.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll have many opportunities to do so
in your assignments.

00:17:42.945 --> 00:17:47.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow clear direction,
and look for Jehovah’s blessing on it.

00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:51.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, on the other hand,
you might be asked to care for something

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s far more involved than that.

00:17:54.523 --> 00:17:57.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, what if you’re asked
to assist someone

00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:02.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s known to be difficult to deal with?

00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you’re asked
to care for a work-related problem

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:08.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
that others have not been able to solve.

00:18:10.072 --> 00:18:14.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re the one selected
because you’ve had the training.

00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:16.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
In such a case, what will help you?

00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:19.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your strong faith—the next step.

00:18:19.448 --> 00:18:23.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact is that at times we need to show
added faith to fulfill our assignments.

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:24.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
True?

00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:26.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the example of Ananias.

00:18:26.488 --> 00:18:28.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he too was a man of faith,

00:18:28.824 --> 00:18:31.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he faced a challenge
that required even more of him,

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we read about it in Acts chapter 9.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll begin with verse 10
—Acts 9:10—

00:18:39.768 --> 00:18:43.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “There was a disciple
named Ananias in Damascus,

00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:46.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Lord said to him in a vision:
‘Ananias!’

00:18:46.175 --> 00:18:48.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said: ‘Here I am, Lord.’

00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:52.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Lord said to him:
‘Get up, go to the street called Straight,

00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:55.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and look for a man named Saul, from Tarsus,

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:57.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘at the house of Judas.

00:18:57.719 --> 00:18:59.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For look! he is praying,

00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:02.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and in a vision he has seen
a man named Ananias

00:19:02.624 --> 00:19:06.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“come in and lay his hands on him
so that he may recover sight.’

00:19:06.495 --> 00:19:08.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Ananias answered: ‘Lord,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have heard from many about this man,

00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:17.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘about all the harm he did
to your holy ones in Jerusalem.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:19.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And here he has authority
from the chief priests

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to arrest all those calling on your name.’

00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:25.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the Lord said to him:
‘Go! because this man

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:29.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is a chosen vessel to me
to bear my name to the nations

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:32.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:35.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For I will show him plainly how many things

00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:38.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
he must suffer for my name.’”

00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:41.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the direction was clear.

00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:45.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where should Ananias go?
To the street called Straight.

00:19:45.367 --> 00:19:48.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was he looking for?
A man named Saul.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
What house is he in?
The house of Judas.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ananias was even told what Saul was doing.

00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:56.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was praying.

00:19:56.979 --> 00:20:00.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Ananias was told what he should do.

00:20:00.148 --> 00:20:04.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was to lay his hands on him
so that he would recover sight.

00:20:04.586 --> 00:20:05.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simple, right?

00:20:05.988 --> 00:20:07.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus would do the rest.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:12.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great example
of giving clear direction!

00:20:12.427 --> 00:20:16.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here is where Ananias
needed to stir up more faith.

00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:19.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man he was to visit
had severely persecuted

00:20:19.034 --> 00:20:21.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
the holy ones in Jerusalem.

00:20:21.069 --> 00:20:23.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
And speaking to the Lord, Ananias added

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:27.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this man
“has authority from the chief priests

00:20:27.042 --> 00:20:30.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
to arrest all those calling on your name.”

00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:33.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, talk about stating
the obvious to Jesus.

00:20:35.217 --> 00:20:38.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Ananias had a moment

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he was overwhelmed
by the weight of the assignment.

00:20:40.422 --> 00:20:42.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s just what happened.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would help him?
More faith.

00:20:44.726 --> 00:20:47.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus knew how to draw it up
in that dear man.

00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:49.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look again at Jesus’ reply.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:53.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
He simply restated his command: “Go.”

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:57.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jesus said that “this man
is a chosen vessel to me

00:20:57.472 --> 00:20:59.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to bear my name to the nations

00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:02.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.”

00:21:03.312 --> 00:21:06.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus added something there, didn’t he?

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:08.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
He pointed to the future.

00:21:08.984 --> 00:21:10.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was he doing?

00:21:10.652 --> 00:21:14.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was helping Ananias to look ahead, see.

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:17.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
And doing this evidently prompted Ananias

00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:20.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show even more faith,
which is what he needed.

00:21:20.929 --> 00:21:22.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know this?

00:21:22.464 --> 00:21:24.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, look at what he said to Saul.

00:21:24.499 --> 00:21:27.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
On meeting Saul, verse 17 tells us

00:21:27.402 --> 00:21:30.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Ananias called him “brother.”

00:21:30.505 --> 00:21:32.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
His initial hesitation had changed

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
into putting his full faith and trust

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:37.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jesus’ direction.

00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:41.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, like Ananias,
as you face challenges in the future

00:21:41.249 --> 00:21:44.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and they will come;
they come upon all of us),

00:21:44.486 --> 00:21:48.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
have strong faith
that Jehovah sees what is needed,

00:21:48.023 --> 00:21:51.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he and his dear Son will help you.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep the big picture in mind,

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:57.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look to the blessings ahead
for your hard work.

00:21:57.132 --> 00:22:02.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will always bless
your strong faith in him.

00:22:02.004 --> 00:22:05.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, so far we’ve looked at the need
to follow clear direction

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to show strong faith.

00:22:07.442 --> 00:22:09.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re going to add another step:

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:13.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use common sense, or thinking ability.

00:22:13.181 --> 00:22:16.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Bible example—Elijah.

00:22:16.184 --> 00:22:19.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this account,
Elijah has traveled to Zarephath,

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:22.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Phoenician coastal town.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was his business there?

00:22:24.393 --> 00:22:27.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the land was
in the grip of a long drought,

00:22:27.129 --> 00:22:29.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah would help his prophet

00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:32.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of someone in that town.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah was told: “Look!

00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:38.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will command a widow there
to supply you with food.”

00:22:38.006 --> 00:22:42.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
It appears that he gave no other details
about the widow than that.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how would Elijah find her?

00:22:45.247 --> 00:22:49.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Elijah look for the wealthiest widow
to care for his needs?

00:22:49.584 --> 00:22:54.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or would he use common sense
and thinking ability along with his faith?

00:22:54.189 --> 00:22:59.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what Elijah does
at 1 Kings chapter 17.

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:02.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to read verse 10
—First Kings 17:10,

00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:07.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “So he [Elijah]
rose up and went to Zarephath.

00:23:07.702 --> 00:23:10.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he came to the entrance of the city,

00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:13.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there was a widow gathering pieces of wood.

00:23:13.542 --> 00:23:15.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he called to her and said:

00:23:15.544 --> 00:23:19.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Please, bring me a little water in a cup
so that I may drink.’”

00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:24.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then what did Elijah do?

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:28.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, he approached
the very first widow he met.

00:23:28.957 --> 00:23:32.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she was not a wealthy widow,
but a poor one.

00:23:32.461 --> 00:23:35.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it says Elijah had not yet passed

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
beyond the entrance of the city.

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:40.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this tell us about Elijah?

00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:43.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he showed no prejudice

00:23:43.738 --> 00:23:46.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
in following through on Jehovah’s direction,
did he?

00:23:46.808 --> 00:23:50.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second, he added thinking ability

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:52.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his obedience and faith.

00:23:52.781 --> 00:23:54.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:23:54.116 --> 00:23:57.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, common sense would tell him
to show his faith

00:23:57.319 --> 00:24:01.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start looking
with the very first widow he met.

00:24:01.656 --> 00:24:04.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah obviously had confidence

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:07.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would make his choice clear.

00:24:07.762 --> 00:24:10.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
His obedience, faith, and good sense
were rewarded

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:14.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that widow was Jehovah’s choice.

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:17.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, surely holy spirit guided Elijah,

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:20.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can’t ignore
the faith and clear thinking ability

00:24:20.775 --> 00:24:25.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Elijah developed
as he obediently did God’s will.

00:24:25.347 --> 00:24:28.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, prior to that widow,
Jehovah used birds

00:24:28.183 --> 00:24:30.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry food to his prophet.

00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:34.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Surely Jehovah
could use a poor widow as well.

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:37.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson for you and for all of us?

00:24:37.859 --> 00:24:40.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we’re given much to go on

00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:42.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we receive an assignment

00:24:42.864 --> 00:24:46.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, at other times, frankly,
maybe not so much.

00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:50.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
In such a case,
our faith and clear thinking ability

00:24:50.772 --> 00:24:53.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
remind us to trust in Jehovah

00:24:53.341 --> 00:24:58.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to look for his guidance
as we go forward in doing his will.

00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:02.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will always help you dear friends
at the right time.

00:25:03.518 --> 00:25:06.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then, as our examples show, promptly obey,

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:11.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
show strong faith,
and use common sense and thinking ability

00:25:11.526 --> 00:25:14.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our service to our dear heavenly Father.

00:25:14.729 --> 00:25:17.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remembering such lessons will help you

00:25:17.232 --> 00:25:19.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you support Jehovah’s work

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your respective branches.

00:25:22.137 --> 00:25:25.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives power beyond what is normal

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who rely on him

00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:31.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and follow the steps that lead to blessings.

00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:35.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we are confident
that this will always be true of you.

00:25:44.025 --> 00:25:45.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Cook.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
You clearly helped us to see
the steps that are needed

00:25:49.364 --> 00:25:52.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to gain blessings.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now our next speaker on the program

00:25:54.836 --> 00:25:59.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Brother Jeffrey Winder,
who is a helper to the Personnel Committee.

00:25:59.074 --> 00:26:03.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Winder is going to discuss
with us this very interesting question,

00:26:03.278 --> 00:26:05.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Close Can You Be?”

00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:11.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you students answer this question:

00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:15.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you feel closer to Jehovah now

00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:18.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
than you did
before your Gilead training began?

00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:24.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is a resounding yes, isn’t it?

00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:26.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you can relate to these comments

00:26:26.868 --> 00:26:30.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
of graduates of past classes of Gilead.

00:26:30.138 --> 00:26:33.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother said: “Absolutely, yes!

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:36.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I believe I now experience more fully

00:26:36.878 --> 00:26:39.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what it means to walk with God

00:26:39.581 --> 00:26:43.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and know and rely upon him
as a close Friend,

00:26:43.318 --> 00:26:46.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
not merely someone
I turn and look up to in prayer.”

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:53.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister said:
“Gilead definitely drew me closer to Jehovah.

00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:56.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The way we studied the Scriptures
with intensity

00:26:56.131 --> 00:27:01.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
truly made me feel like the Bible
was a letter Jehovah wrote to me.”

00:27:02.771 --> 00:27:07.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another brother said:
“Jehovah communicated with such clarity,

00:27:07.542 --> 00:27:10.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which made it real and personal.

00:27:11.413 --> 00:27:15.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It made me feel closer to Jehovah
than ever before,

00:27:15.083 --> 00:27:18.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that feeling will never be forgotten.”

00:27:19.587 --> 00:27:23.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, unquestionably,
your deep study of God’s Word during Gilead

00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:26.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
drew you closer to Jehovah.

00:27:27.195 --> 00:27:29.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the question,

00:27:29.531 --> 00:27:32.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
How close can you be?

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:35.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
How close
can your relationship with Jehovah get?

00:27:35.603 --> 00:27:40.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw it leap forward in five months
of deep Bible study, but is there a limit?

00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:43.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there more?
Will you ever get done?

00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:47.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider two points
that answer that question.

00:27:47.782 --> 00:27:50.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is found
in the book of James chapter 4,

00:27:53.388 --> 00:27:56.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read together
the first part of verse 8.

00:27:57.592 --> 00:27:59.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s read it with that question in mind:

00:27:59.928 --> 00:28:04.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there any limit to how close
our relationship with Jehovah could be?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 4:8 says:

00:28:08.503 --> 00:28:10.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Draw close to God,

00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:14.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will draw close to you.”

00:28:16.244 --> 00:28:19.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
So is there any limit indicated here?

00:28:19.714 --> 00:28:24.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it is true that in English
this phrase to “draw close to” someone

00:28:24.185 --> 00:28:26.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
could be applied in a physical sense

00:28:26.254 --> 00:28:28.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
—actually standing next to someone.

00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:29.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that case, there is a limit.

00:28:29.891 --> 00:28:32.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can only stand so close to someone.

00:28:32.627 --> 00:28:36.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s not really the sense of James 4:8,
is it?

00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:41.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, it’s in this sense:
When we talk about our close friends,

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:44.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not talking about those
that are nearest in proximity.

00:28:44.939 --> 00:28:47.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re talking
about the depth of our relationship,

00:28:47.242 --> 00:28:50.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
the closeness of our friendship.

00:28:50.078 --> 00:28:52.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so then to “draw close to God” then means

00:28:52.847 --> 00:28:57.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen our relationship,
strengthen our friendship, with him.

00:28:57.552 --> 00:29:01.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then looking at the verse,
does it appear that there’s any limit

00:29:01.122 --> 00:29:04.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
to how close that relationship can get?

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:08.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
The implication is that as long
as we keep drawing close to Jehovah,

00:29:08.363 --> 00:29:11.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
then he’ll keep drawing close to us.

00:29:12.367 --> 00:29:15.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that takes us to our second point,

00:29:15.236 --> 00:29:19.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is the real life example
of God’s Son,

00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:21.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus drew close to Jehovah.

00:29:21.643 --> 00:29:24.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, he was taught by Jehovah.

00:29:24.245 --> 00:29:26.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Isaiah 50:4,

00:29:26.247 --> 00:29:29.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding Jesus’ prehuman existence,
where he said:

00:29:29.451 --> 00:29:32.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He awakens me morning by morning;

00:29:32.053 --> 00:29:37.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
he awakens my ear
to listen like the taught ones.”

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:39.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that sound a bit
like your Gilead training?

00:29:39.527 --> 00:29:43.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Morning by morning
Jehovah was awakening your ear.’

00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:47.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, Jesus wasn’t instructed by Jehovah
for five months;

00:29:47.936 --> 00:29:52.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was instructed for billions of years.

00:29:52.073 --> 00:29:54.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during all that time,

00:29:54.609 --> 00:29:59.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
his relationship with his Father
continued to grow and deepen.

00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:03.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, we put it all together.

00:30:03.485 --> 00:30:07.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw your relationship with Jehovah
grow significantly

00:30:07.255 --> 00:30:10.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
in five months of deep Bible study.

00:30:10.358 --> 00:30:14.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 4:8 encourages us
to just keep drawing close to Jehovah.

00:30:14.762 --> 00:30:17.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus did so for billions of years,

00:30:17.198 --> 00:30:21.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look at how close
his relationship with Jehovah is.

00:30:21.636 --> 00:30:23.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what’s the answer?

00:30:23.805 --> 00:30:27.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
How close can you be to Jehovah?

00:30:28.676 --> 00:30:32.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
The potential for your relationship
with Jehovah to deepen

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
is endless.

00:30:36.718 --> 00:30:39.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s just wonderful to contemplate,
isn’t it?

00:30:39.787 --> 00:30:41.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s make some application

00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:45.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
because this really becomes
a very important overall lesson

00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:48.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you take with you
from your Gilead experience:

00:30:48.229 --> 00:30:50.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how your deep Bible study

00:30:50.832 --> 00:30:53.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
affected your relationship with Jehovah.

00:30:53.968 --> 00:30:56.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one of the reasons
why this is such an important lesson

00:30:56.804 --> 00:31:00.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because your success in your assignment

00:31:00.308 --> 00:31:05.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
is directly connected to the depth
of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:31:06.814 --> 00:31:08.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your success in your assignment

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
is directly connected to the depth
of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:31:13.221 --> 00:31:15.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why can we say that?

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because of what takes place

00:31:18.226 --> 00:31:22.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we draw close to Jehovah
through a study of his Word.

00:31:22.096 --> 00:31:25.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to the book of Psalms,

00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:28.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read the 25th Psalm

00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:32.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 4

00:31:35.243 --> 00:31:37.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 25:4.

00:31:37.845 --> 00:31:38.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Make me know your ways, O Jehovah;

00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:46.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
teach me your paths.”

00:31:46.621 --> 00:31:49.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what’s happening
when we study God’s Word, isn’t it?

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are coming to know Jehovah God’s ways.

00:31:52.594 --> 00:31:54.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once said it this way.

00:31:54.896 --> 00:31:59.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said: “As we get a deeper
and deeper understanding of God’s Word,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
we become imbued
with God’s way of thinking.”

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:08.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We become imbued
with God’s way of thinking.”

00:32:08.343 --> 00:32:10.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
The dictionary said that the word

00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:14.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“imbue implies the introduction of a quality

00:32:14.082 --> 00:32:18.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fills and permeates the whole being,”

00:32:18.786 --> 00:32:23.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
so like dyeing a garment or leavening bread.

00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:26.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here we’re talking
about being imbued with God’s thinking,

00:32:26.928 --> 00:32:31.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
that maybe God’s thinking
would fill and permeate our whole being.

00:32:32.467 --> 00:32:34.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that possible?

00:32:35.403 --> 00:32:38.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to the example of Jesus.

00:32:38.072 --> 00:32:40.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we discussed,
Jesus drew close to Jehovah.

00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:43.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was taught by Jehovah
for billions of years.

00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:47.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what was happening
during that whole time?

00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:51.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was being imbued
with Jehovah God’s thinking.

00:32:51.753 --> 00:32:55.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it so permeated him
that when he was on earth,

00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:57.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could say at John 14:9:

00:32:57.225 --> 00:33:01.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whoever has seen me
has seen the Father also.”

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:04.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in other words,
everything that Jesus said,

00:33:04.866 --> 00:33:08.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything that he did while on earth
in every situation,

00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:13.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, we could imagine Jehovah
doing and saying those very things.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:20.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is why
the success of your assignment

00:33:20.014 --> 00:33:24.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
is directly connected to the depth
of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:33:24.852 --> 00:33:28.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more you draw close to Jehovah
through a study of his Word,

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the more you are imbued
with his thinking

00:33:31.893 --> 00:33:35.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the more then you will do, or act,

00:33:35.129 --> 00:33:38.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say things as Jehovah would.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so how does this play out?

00:33:41.402 --> 00:33:43.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in your assignment,

00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:48.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you have the privilege
to contribute to significant decisions

00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:51.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will affect others in your department

00:33:51.012 --> 00:33:54.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
or at the branch or in the field even,

00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:58.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
my, you want to be guided
by Jehovah’s thinking, don’t you?

00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:01.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to do things as he would do them.

00:34:01.022 --> 00:34:05.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the closer you are to Jehovah,
the deeper that relationship is,

00:34:05.526 --> 00:34:09.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more your decisions will mirror his.

00:34:11.933 --> 00:34:14.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, we know
strengthening and stabilizing others

00:34:14.836 --> 00:34:17.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
isn’t always done
in big, grand gestures like that

00:34:17.371 --> 00:34:20.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
—big decisions,
new organizational arrangements.

00:34:20.108 --> 00:34:23.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Quite often it’s the day-to-day interactions
with others

00:34:23.945 --> 00:34:25.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really encourage them.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it true that we learn so much

00:34:28.049 --> 00:34:32.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
from those intimate conversations
that Jesus had with others,

00:34:32.086 --> 00:34:36.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
or seemingly incidental interactions
that he had with others,

00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:39.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible records?

00:34:39.193 --> 00:34:42.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you will strengthen others
in similar ways.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:44.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:34:44.532 --> 00:34:49.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you are guided
by Jehovah’s thinking in personal matters,

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:52.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as in your choice of dress and grooming,

00:34:52.907 --> 00:34:55.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, others will certainly notice that

00:34:55.243 --> 00:34:57.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will strengthen their resolve

00:34:57.411 --> 00:35:00.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make good decisions
in these personal areas.

00:35:00.782 --> 00:35:05.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you are guided by Jehovah’s thinking
in the use of your time,

00:35:05.453 --> 00:35:07.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
as busy as you will be

00:35:07.455 --> 00:35:09.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when the friends see you in the ministry,

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the meetings,
working hard in your assignment—

00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:13.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will take notice of that

00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:18.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will strengthen their resolve
to make good priorities in their life.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time you steer
a negative conversation to the positive,

00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:26.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
every time you show
a willingness to do humble tasks,

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
every time you take the time
to get the other side of the story

00:35:29.977 --> 00:35:31.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
before rendering judgment

00:35:31.979 --> 00:35:35.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, in all these areas of your daily life,

00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:38.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
you give evidence
that you have drawn close to Jehovah,

00:35:38.186 --> 00:35:40.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have been imbued with his thinking,

00:35:40.988 --> 00:35:44.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you are acting as Jehovah would.

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:46.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that case,

00:35:46.127 --> 00:35:50.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
you absolutely will strengthen and stabilize
your brothers!

00:35:53.634 --> 00:35:55.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we love you

00:35:55.937 --> 00:35:59.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your relationship with Jehovah.

00:35:59.173 --> 00:36:03.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we encourage you
to take this lesson of Gilead with you

00:36:03.211 --> 00:36:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the effect that your deep Bible study
had on your relationship with Jehovah—

00:36:07.982 --> 00:36:10.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep drawing close to him.

00:36:10.484 --> 00:36:12.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
The potential is endless,

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is what will ensure your success.

00:36:17.124 --> 00:36:21.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, may the rich blessing of Jehovah,
your Friend, be with you

00:36:21.629 --> 00:36:26.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you use your Gilead training
in the assignments he has given you.

00:36:32.907 --> 00:36:35.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m sure we all agree
that was a beautiful answer

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the question, “How Close Can You Be?”

00:36:38.846 --> 00:36:41.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of us feel close to Jehovah,

00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:46.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what a wonderful encouragement
for us to draw ever closer to him!

00:36:47.388 --> 00:36:50.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next brother, who’s going to give you
some words of encouragement,

00:36:50.524 --> 00:36:52.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a very intriguing theme

00:36:52.894 --> 00:36:56.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Buy a Field in Anathoth.”

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:01.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gage Fleegle,
who’s a helper to the Service Committee,

00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:06.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to develop this theme
“Buy a Field in Anathoth.”

00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:12.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
The year was 608 B.C.E.

00:37:12.046 --> 00:37:14.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophet Jeremiah
had already served

00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:17.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
nearly 40 years faithfully,

00:37:17.385 --> 00:37:22.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now he “was confined
in the Courtyard of the Guard” in Jerusalem.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:26.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem’s walls
were being battered by the Babylonians.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
In less than a year,

00:37:28.462 --> 00:37:31.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire city
would be completely destroyed.

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:33.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah had to weather the storm.

00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:35.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no way out.
There was no place for him to go.

00:37:35.736 --> 00:37:37.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was under lockdown.

00:37:38.739 --> 00:37:41.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, have you ever felt like Jeremiah

00:37:41.075 --> 00:37:44.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
—as if the world was caving in on you?

00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:48.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it was a serious health scare,

00:37:48.449 --> 00:37:52.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
the health of a loved one,
the death of a loved one,

00:37:54.755 --> 00:37:57.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe COVID-19
has made you feel boxed in.

00:37:58.392 --> 00:38:03.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our brothers, just like Jeremiah,
have faced persecution or imprisonment,

00:38:03.364 --> 00:38:07.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that might be our lot
before the end of this system of things.

00:38:07.068 --> 00:38:09.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what will help you students

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in fact, all of us—

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:13.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
during these critical last days

00:38:13.607 --> 00:38:16.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we face personal trials, or adversity?

00:38:16.143 --> 00:38:19.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to open to Jeremiah chapter 32.

00:38:19.847 --> 00:38:24.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a dramatic illustration
in the life of Jeremiah.

00:38:24.518 --> 00:38:27.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jeremiah is under lockdown.

00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:29.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah chapter 32,

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s read verses 6-8:

00:38:33.027 --> 00:38:37.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jeremiah said: ‘The word of Jehovah
has come to me, saying,

00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:42.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Here Hanamel the son of Shallum
your uncle will come to you and say:

00:38:42.169 --> 00:38:44.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth,

00:38:44.472 --> 00:38:47.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you have the first right
to repurchase it.’”’”

00:38:47.842 --> 00:38:50.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says:
“Hanamel the son of my uncle came to me,

00:38:50.611 --> 00:38:54.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as Jehovah had said,
into the Courtyard of the Guard,

00:38:54.215 --> 00:38:57.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he said to me:
‘Please buy my field in Anathoth,

00:38:57.485 --> 00:39:00.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in the land of Benjamin, for you
have the right to take possession of it

00:39:00.554 --> 00:39:01.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and to repurchase it.

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:03.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Buy it for yourself.’

00:39:04.392 --> 00:39:07.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that I knew that this was
by the word of Jehovah.”

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Jehovah’s instruction to Jeremiah?

00:39:11.832 --> 00:39:13.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Buy a field.

00:39:13.634 --> 00:39:15.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Buy a field?

00:39:15.136 --> 00:39:18.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right now, with the Babylonians
beating on the door?

00:39:18.372 --> 00:39:20.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah might have thought,

00:39:20.374 --> 00:39:23.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I need an escape plan, not a field

00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:25.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
—of all places, Anathoth?’

00:39:25.713 --> 00:39:27.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where was Anathoth?

00:39:27.815 --> 00:39:29.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jeremiah knew exactly where it was

00:39:29.884 --> 00:39:33.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just a few miles
north-northeast of Jerusalem.

00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:36.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was born there into a priestly family.

00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:41.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he have pleasant memories of his past
in Anathoth as a youth?

00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:42.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very likely.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now that was a distant memory.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
More recently, men of Anathoth,
possibly some of Jeremiah’s own relatives,

00:39:49.837 --> 00:39:53.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
threatened to kill him
because of his prophesying.

00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:55.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, did Jeremiah obey

00:39:55.843 --> 00:39:59.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spite of any personal feelings
he might have had?

00:39:59.547 --> 00:40:02.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah always obeyed,

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:06.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
even previously when Jehovah told him
not to take a wife or to have children.

00:40:07.688 --> 00:40:09.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did he do in this situation?

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 9 and 10:

00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:16.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So I bought the field in Anathoth
from Hanamel the son of my uncle.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I weighed out the money to him,
seven shekels and ten silver pieces.

00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:23.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then I recorded it in a deed,
affixed the seal,

00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:26.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
called in witnesses,
and weighed the money in the scales.”

00:40:27.341 --> 00:40:29.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah could have worked
in the Legal Department.

00:40:31.779 --> 00:40:34.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he carried out the legal transaction,

00:40:34.815 --> 00:40:37.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
the legal requirements of the transaction.

00:40:37.118 --> 00:40:39.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
He recorded the transaction in two deeds

00:40:39.553 --> 00:40:41.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one sealed, one unsealed—

00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:45.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
complete transparency in this situation.

00:40:45.926 --> 00:40:49.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did Jehovah ask Jeremiah
to buy a field in Anathoth?

00:40:50.764 --> 00:40:55.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah already had complete faith that,
yes, Jehovah’s word would be restored

00:40:55.769 --> 00:40:59.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when 70 years had transpired,
the Jews would return to their homeland.

00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:03.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now Jehovah reinforced Jeremiah’s faith

00:41:03.144 --> 00:41:06.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving him something specific
to think about.

00:41:06.313 --> 00:41:07.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah could imagine the time

00:41:07.915 --> 00:41:11.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
when buying and selling
would again occur in Israel.

00:41:12.686 --> 00:41:17.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, was Jeremiah’s faith
well-placed in Jehovah’s promise?

00:41:18.192 --> 00:41:19.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:41:19.793 --> 00:41:23.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra later documented
that 128 men of Anathoth

00:41:23.864 --> 00:41:28.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
were among the first group
of those returning from Babylonian exile.

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s word always comes true.

00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:38.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how might we
—how might you—

00:41:38.045 --> 00:41:40.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
“buy a field in Anathoth”?

00:41:40.648 --> 00:41:43.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re not expecting you
to go out and purchase

00:41:43.884 --> 00:41:46.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
a piece of property
in a place called Anathoth.

00:41:46.387 --> 00:41:47.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:41:47.388 --> 00:41:51.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find a clue, though, in Hebrews chapter 11

00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:53.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Hebrews 11:1:

00:41:55.930 --> 00:42:00.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for,

00:42:00.668 --> 00:42:04.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
the evident demonstration
of realities that are not seen.”

00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:09.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Simple English Bible </i>
renders it this way:

00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:12.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faith is the title-deed

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the things we hope for.”

00:42:15.482 --> 00:42:19.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, most of us in special full-time service,
we don’t own property.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we may have the title to a car.

00:42:22.189 --> 00:42:23.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:27.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that car, that vehicle,
belongs to us personally.

00:42:28.162 --> 00:42:31.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith is the “title-deed”
of good things to come,

00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:34.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
a guarantee of future realities.

00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:36.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah had a “title-deed.”

00:42:36.537 --> 00:42:39.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a “title-deed” of faith.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we “buy a field in Anathoth”?

00:42:42.743 --> 00:42:47.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a type-antitype situation;
it’s just an illustration.

00:42:47.081 --> 00:42:49.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the context of our discussion,

00:42:49.416 --> 00:42:53.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
it means we exercise faith
in Jehovah’s promises.

00:42:54.288 --> 00:42:56.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
When facing a trial,

00:42:56.657 --> 00:43:01.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can search Jehovah’s Word
for promises regarding the future,

00:43:01.262 --> 00:43:03.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that gives us strength
to keep on enduring.

00:43:03.631 --> 00:43:07.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
if we’re facing a serious illness,

00:43:07.601 --> 00:43:11.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word promises:
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:43:12.773 --> 00:43:15.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re grieving the death of a loved one,

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:20.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible assures us
there is going to be a resurrection.

00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:23.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
The trial doesn’t disappear yet,

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
but exercising faith in Jehovah’s promises

00:43:26.053 --> 00:43:28.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to endure.

00:43:29.089 --> 00:43:30.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s something else that we can learn

00:43:30.758 --> 00:43:34.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
from that dramatic illustration
in the life of Jeremiah.

00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:39.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in Jeremiah 32, notice,
please, verses 13 through 15.

00:43:40.234 --> 00:43:42.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah was inspired to write, he said:

00:43:42.803 --> 00:43:46.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I now commanded Baruch
in their presence, saying:

00:43:46.573 --> 00:43:51.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This is what Jehovah of armies,
the God of Israel, says,

00:43:51.178 --> 00:43:53.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Take these deeds, this deed of purchase,

00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:56.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“the sealed one
and the other deed left unsealed,

00:43:56.583 --> 00:43:58.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“and put them into an earthenware vessel,

00:43:58.585 --> 00:44:01.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that they may be kept for a long time.”

00:44:01.555 --> 00:44:06.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For this is what Jehovah of armies,
the God of Israel, says,

00:44:06.093 --> 00:44:10.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Houses and fields and vineyards
will again be bought in this land.”’”

00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:15.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah involved Baruch
in the legal proceedings

00:44:15.669 --> 00:44:18.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he bought the field in Anathoth.

00:44:18.439 --> 00:44:23.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah’s faith
influenced Baruch for the good.

00:44:23.444 --> 00:44:26.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can almost hear
the confidence and conviction in his voice:

00:44:26.814 --> 00:44:30.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies,
the God of Israel says.”

00:44:30.984 --> 00:44:32.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah used that expression,

00:44:32.853 --> 00:44:35.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah of armies,”
more than any other Bible writer.

00:44:35.556 --> 00:44:37.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like Jeremiah said:

00:44:37.257 --> 00:44:39.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Our God will certainly overturn
the Babylonians.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘These promises are real;
you can take them to the bank!

00:44:42.896 --> 00:44:45.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not counterfeit;
they’re completely true!’

00:44:47.234 --> 00:44:49.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:44:50.003 --> 00:44:53.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith can strengthen fellow believers.

00:44:54.074 --> 00:44:58.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister named Joyce,
while she herself was fighting cancer,

00:44:58.512 --> 00:45:02.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
made what she called shot-in-the-arm cards.

00:45:02.916 --> 00:45:05.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were collections of Bible verses,

00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:07.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
pictures from our publications,

00:45:07.721 --> 00:45:10.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
quotes from theocratic songs
or <i>Watchtower </i> articles,

00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:13.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she would give them
to those in need of encouragement.

00:45:13.727 --> 00:45:18.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of her favorites was Psalm 112:7, 8.

00:45:18.532 --> 00:45:22.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there it says:
“He will not fear bad news.

00:45:22.436 --> 00:45:24.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.

00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:27.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His heart is unshakable; he is not afraid;

00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:31.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the end he will look in triumph
on his adversaries.”

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:35.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Joyce had
a lot of bad news in her life,

00:45:36.884 --> 00:45:40.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
but her faith in Jehovah’s promises
was powerful.

00:45:41.288 --> 00:45:45.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, Joyce lost her fight with cancer
a few years back,

00:45:45.025 --> 00:45:47.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she “bought a field in Anathoth,”

00:45:48.162 --> 00:45:53.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she will witness
the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises.

00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:56.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even now, she’s given us a shot in the arm

00:45:56.303 --> 00:45:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
—encouragement from Jehovah’s Word—

00:45:58.305 --> 00:46:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthened us with her faith.

00:46:00.474 --> 00:46:03.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, dear Gilead students,
what have we learned?

00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:07.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith is like
a “title-deed of things hoped for.”

00:46:07.748 --> 00:46:12.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith in Jehovah’s Word
helps us to endure trials and adversity.

00:46:12.219 --> 00:46:16.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith can have
a powerful effect on those around us.

00:46:16.223 --> 00:46:19.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when faced with persecution,
“buy a field in Anathoth.”

00:46:20.627 --> 00:46:24.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
When faced with a grievous health problem,
“buy a field in Anathoth.”

00:46:24.765 --> 00:46:27.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
When grieving the loss of a loved one,
“buy a field in Anathoth.”

00:46:27.868 --> 00:46:30.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some day soon,
your faith will be rewarded.

00:46:31.605 --> 00:46:36.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll walk in that field
when Jehovah’s word comes true.

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what a beautiful talk!

00:46:45.752 --> 00:46:47.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now to be honest
(I don’t know if you are like me),

00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:51.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I heard the theme
“Buy a Field in Anathoth,”

00:46:51.191 --> 00:46:54.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought,
‘Where on earth is he going to take us?’

00:46:55.562 --> 00:46:57.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, to be quite honest.

00:46:57.598 --> 00:47:01.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Brother Fleegle,
you took us to a very good spot

00:47:01.568 --> 00:47:04.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the title deed and seeing
the connection there.

00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:06.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in fact, that’s going to be
a little password.

00:47:06.874 --> 00:47:09.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might say, “Buy a field in Anathoth.”

00:47:09.343 --> 00:47:12.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we say that to someone
and they looked amazed,

00:47:12.446 --> 00:47:16.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll say, “Oh, you weren’t there
for the graduation program.”

00:47:18.986 --> 00:47:20.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you very much.

00:47:20.988 --> 00:47:24.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for you, dear students,
over the last few months,

00:47:24.725 --> 00:47:27.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve drawn very close to the instructors,

00:47:27.895 --> 00:47:31.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ve heard them day in, day out.

00:47:31.298 --> 00:47:34.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve learned and experienced
a lot of things from them.

00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:36.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the next two parts

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
are the opportunities
for two of these instructors

00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:42.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give you
a few final words of encouragement.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:46.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first of all,
we’re going to have Brother Trent Lippold

00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:49.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s going to talk to you,
and he has this interesting question:

00:47:49.917 --> 00:47:52.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Distinguished—By What?”

00:47:55.155 --> 00:47:56.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a mighty man.

00:47:57.958 --> 00:48:01.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felled the heroes of the enemy.

00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:04.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
He slayed a giant.
He even killed a lion.

00:48:04.765 --> 00:48:07.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his name was not David.

00:48:08.101 --> 00:48:09.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was he?

00:48:09.703 --> 00:48:13.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open your Bibles with me, please,
to the book of 1 Chronicles chapter 11

00:48:15.075 --> 00:48:18.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Chronicles 11:22:

00:48:21.048 --> 00:48:23.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Benaiah the son of Jehoiada

00:48:23.784 --> 00:48:26.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was a courageous man who performed

00:48:26.353 --> 00:48:29.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“many exploits in Kabzeel.

00:48:29.423 --> 00:48:32.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He struck down
the two sons of Ariel of Moab,

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:37.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he descended into a waterpit
on a snowy day and killed a lion.

00:48:38.465 --> 00:48:42.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He also struck down an Egyptian man
of extraordinary size

00:48:42.302 --> 00:48:44.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—five cubits tall.

00:48:44.905 --> 00:48:47.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand

00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:50.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the beam of loom workers,

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:52.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he went against him with a rod

00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:54.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and snatched the spear away
from the Egyptian’s hand

00:48:54.748 --> 00:48:57.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
and killed him with his own spear.”

00:48:58.819 --> 00:49:00.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is Benaiah.

00:49:02.422 --> 00:49:06.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at all we learn about him
in these verses,

00:49:06.259 --> 00:49:09.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
the qualities that Benaiah displayed.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
It tells us in verse 22
that he “was a courageous man.”

00:49:14.501 --> 00:49:17.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
He “performed many exploits in Kabzeel.”

00:49:17.838 --> 00:49:21.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kabzeel—Kabzeel is a small place

00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:24.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the very southern border of Judah.

00:49:24.678 --> 00:49:28.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
It borders Edom in the middle of nowhere.

00:49:29.182 --> 00:49:31.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Benaiah worked there.

00:49:31.852 --> 00:49:33.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was happy to be there.

00:49:33.553 --> 00:49:35.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be that that was his home.

00:49:35.322 --> 00:49:37.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or it may be that that was his assignment.

00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:41.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter,
as obscure a place as Kabzeel is,

00:49:41.995 --> 00:49:44.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s where he worked.

00:49:44.031 --> 00:49:45.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the record says that he performed

00:49:45.966 --> 00:49:49.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
many exploits courageously in Kabzeel.

00:49:52.105 --> 00:49:55.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
He killed a lion—courage.

00:49:55.442 --> 00:49:59.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you notice
that “he descended into a waterpit . . .

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and killed a lion”?

00:50:01.615 --> 00:50:03.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courage.

00:50:03.083 --> 00:50:05.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
He descended into a waterpit
with a lion.

00:50:05.018 --> 00:50:09.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s only one coming out,
and it was Benaiah.

00:50:09.222 --> 00:50:12.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He descended into a waterpit
on a snowy day.”

00:50:12.726 --> 00:50:14.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t wait for the sun to shine.

00:50:14.828 --> 00:50:19.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that was the day
—adverse conditions, no matter.

00:50:19.032 --> 00:50:21.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah went in, and he slayed the lion.

00:50:23.136 --> 00:50:25.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at verse 23,
some more amazing qualities.

00:50:25.839 --> 00:50:29.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
He struck down the giant,
‘an Egyptian of extraordinary size.’

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:32.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice this: “Though the Egyptian
had a spear in his hand

00:50:32.312 --> 00:50:35.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the beam of loom workers,
he [Benaiah]

00:50:35.082 --> 00:50:39.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
went against him with a rod”—a rod, a stick.

00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:41.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t have the right equipment

00:50:41.588 --> 00:50:46.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
—courage, adaptability, commitment.

00:50:46.359 --> 00:50:48.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice this.
What does he do?

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:53.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “He went against him with a rod
and snatched the spear away

00:50:53.366 --> 00:50:56.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Egyptian’s hand
and killed him with his own spear.”

00:50:57.838 --> 00:51:01.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courage, commitment,
adaptability, resourcefulness

00:51:02.876 --> 00:51:05.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these are admirable, beneficial qualities.

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are those the qualities
that distinguished Benaiah?

00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:12.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not entirely.

00:51:13.453 --> 00:51:17.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was one quality that exceeded these,

00:51:17.724 --> 00:51:19.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that quality was loyalty

00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:25.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
—tenacious adherence
to the person of Jehovah.

00:51:25.632 --> 00:51:29.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the Bible record reveals
about Benaiah:

00:51:29.236 --> 00:51:31.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:51:34.407 --> 00:51:36.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a caution, though, with loyalty.

00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:40.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
The demarcation

00:51:40.714 --> 00:51:45.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
between loyalty to Jehovah
and loyalty to self

00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:48.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
can often be blurry.

00:51:50.824 --> 00:51:54.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
It hides under the inertia

00:51:54.261 --> 00:51:58.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
of imperfection and selfishness.

00:51:58.031 --> 00:52:02.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
That line of loyalty to Jehovah
versus loyalty to self

00:52:03.303 --> 00:52:05.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
can become very difficult to see.

00:52:05.939 --> 00:52:09.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, loyalty to self
can lie dormant within us

00:52:10.911 --> 00:52:15.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the circumstances arise and change,

00:52:15.248 --> 00:52:17.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then it can emerge.

00:52:17.784 --> 00:52:20.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Benaiah and his contemporaries

00:52:20.253 --> 00:52:23.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
provide for us a beautiful contrast

00:52:24.391 --> 00:52:27.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
in loyalty to Jehovah and loyalty to self.

00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:33.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of Benaiah.
He lived in a very tumultuous time.

00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:35.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
David was a fugitive with his mighty men.

00:52:35.702 --> 00:52:38.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of them likely was Benaiah, among others.

00:52:38.805 --> 00:52:41.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men were comrades in arms
running with David.

00:52:41.975 --> 00:52:44.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were a band of brothers.

00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:47.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were fiercely loyal to David

00:52:47.848 --> 00:52:51.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, to be sure,
they were loyal to Jehovah as well.

00:52:51.051 --> 00:52:53.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, among these three mighty men

00:52:53.653 --> 00:52:57.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
were three brothers, fleshly brothers.

00:52:57.457 --> 00:53:00.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re mentioned in verses 20 and 26:

00:53:00.126 --> 00:53:04.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.

00:53:06.366 --> 00:53:11.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now consider when circumstances changed
for the mighty men,

00:53:11.972 --> 00:53:16.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Saul died and David now became king,

00:53:16.676 --> 00:53:20.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
in these changing circumstances,

00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:23.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened to the mighty men?

00:53:23.383 --> 00:53:27.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the contrast: Joab and Benaiah.

00:53:27.954 --> 00:53:30.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened to Joab?

00:53:30.523 --> 00:53:35.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joab saw opportunity
in changing circumstances,

00:53:35.495 --> 00:53:39.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his loyalty to Jehovah was eclipsed

00:53:39.933 --> 00:53:43.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
by his loyalty to himself.

00:53:43.036 --> 00:53:45.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,

00:53:45.238 --> 00:53:49.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was Joab who took matters
into his own hands,

00:53:49.676 --> 00:53:52.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he killed Abner

00:53:52.112 --> 00:53:54.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom David
had already concluded a covenant.

00:53:56.316 --> 00:53:58.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took matters into his own hands.

00:53:58.451 --> 00:54:01.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?
He wanted Abner’s job.

00:54:02.856 --> 00:54:06.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
His selfish ambitions got the better of him,

00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:09.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they eclipsed his loyalty to Jehovah.

00:54:09.396 --> 00:54:11.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joab was a courageous man.

00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:12.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was resourceful.

00:54:12.465 --> 00:54:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was adaptable.

00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:16.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Admirable qualities.

00:54:16.136 --> 00:54:20.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the absence
of deep personal loyalty to Jehovah,

00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:23.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
they seem somehow tainted, don’t they?

00:54:25.378 --> 00:54:28.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
But consider Benaiah
in the same circumstances.

00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:33.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah had no part in these kind
of intrigues like Joab and his brothers.

00:54:33.353 --> 00:54:36.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah was loyal to Jehovah,
and he was a loyal man

00:54:36.489 --> 00:54:39.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s anointed one, David.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at what we find in verses 24 and 25,

00:54:44.464 --> 00:54:49.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 24 and 25: “These things
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did,

00:54:49.436 --> 00:54:53.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he had a reputation
like that of the three mighty warriors.

00:54:53.506 --> 00:54:56.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although he was distinguished
even more than the thirty,

00:54:56.943 --> 00:55:01.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he did not attain to the rank of the three.

00:55:01.815 --> 00:55:06.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, David appointed him
over his own bodyguard.”

00:55:08.421 --> 00:55:13.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, in the same circumstances as Joab,

00:55:13.126 --> 00:55:16.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah’s tenacious adherence to Jehovah

00:55:16.496 --> 00:55:18.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah—

00:55:18.498 --> 00:55:22.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
safeguarded him in these circumstances.

00:55:22.369 --> 00:55:25.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did David see in Benaiah?

00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:30.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
David saw in Benaiah
what he himself exemplified,

00:55:30.944 --> 00:55:35.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was deep and strong personal loyalty
to Jehovah.

00:55:35.548 --> 00:55:38.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see that in this verse,
in verse 25, can’t you?

00:55:38.385 --> 00:55:43.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “However, David appointed him
over his own bodyguard.”

00:55:43.023 --> 00:55:45.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
David knew that to assign someone

00:55:45.158 --> 00:55:48.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this very, very trusted position

00:55:49.662 --> 00:55:53.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
(head of his own bodyguard),
the man in that position,

00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:57.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he was loyal to Jehovah,
would be loyal to him.

00:55:57.437 --> 00:55:59.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what David saw in Benaiah.

00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:04.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then came another time of change
decades later.

00:56:05.712 --> 00:56:09.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David died and Solomon became king

00:56:09.516 --> 00:56:14.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
—changed circumstances,
another time of opportunity—

00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:16.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
how would Benaiah react?

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:18.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same way he always did:

00:56:20.093 --> 00:56:23.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
deep personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:56:23.696 --> 00:56:27.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was Solomon when he became king

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
who rewarded Benaiah.

00:56:29.903 --> 00:56:33.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
The son of David, Solomon,
Jehovah’s anointed,

00:56:33.673 --> 00:56:36.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
rewarded Benaiah for his loyalty.

00:56:36.643 --> 00:56:40.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Proverbs 19:22.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Solomon
knew something about loyalty.

00:56:45.385 --> 00:56:47.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was the son of David.

00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:52.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at what he wrote about loyalty
at Proverbs 19:22.

00:56:52.692 --> 00:56:56.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon said: “The desirable thing in a man

00:56:56.096 --> 00:56:58.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
is his loyal love.”

00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:03.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
His loyalty
—that’s what Jehovah looks for in us.

00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:07.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Benaiah was indeed a mighty man,

00:57:07.907 --> 00:57:11.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had beautiful qualities.

00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:13.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they distinguish him?

00:57:13.847 --> 00:57:15.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not entirely.

00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:19.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah

00:57:19.219 --> 00:57:23.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
first and foremost that distinguished him.

00:57:23.223 --> 00:57:26.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of that deep personal loyalty
to Jehovah,

00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:30.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
those qualities of Benaiah were beautiful.

00:57:31.764 --> 00:57:35.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
So daily cultivate your loyalty to God

00:57:35.969 --> 00:57:38.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
through prayer and study.

00:57:38.238 --> 00:57:41.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s been your training here.

00:57:41.007 --> 00:57:45.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use your training to develop
your close personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:57:46.846 --> 00:57:50.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Benaiah did.
Think of Benaiah’s training.

00:57:50.483 --> 00:57:52.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was the son of Jehoiada.

00:57:52.519 --> 00:57:57.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoiada was
one of the chief Levitical priests in Israel.

00:57:58.191 --> 00:58:01.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah was raised with scrolls,
not with swords.

00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:06.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up as the son of a priest,
that was his training.

00:58:07.834 --> 00:58:09.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
So like Benaiah,

00:58:09.969 --> 00:58:13.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
be willing to do the work without the rank.

00:58:14.807 --> 00:58:18.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, loyalty is tested
not when you are at ease.

00:58:18.645 --> 00:58:21.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loyalty is tested under adversity.

00:58:21.514 --> 00:58:24.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be careful in changing circumstances.

00:58:24.984 --> 00:58:26.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guard your hearts.

00:58:28.688 --> 00:58:30.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear students,
you all have beautiful qualities.

00:58:30.957 --> 00:58:33.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve seen them over the last five months.

00:58:33.826 --> 00:58:35.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
But may loyalty,

00:58:35.995 --> 00:58:40.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
may your deep personal loyalty to Jehovah,

00:58:40.266 --> 00:58:42.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
distinguish you.

00:58:49.576 --> 00:58:52.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much,
Brother Lippold, for that.

00:58:52.011 --> 00:58:56.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all felt like we were students
in the Gilead classroom, didn’t we?

00:58:56.015 --> 00:59:00.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
And certainly you helped us
to see the importance of loyalty.

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the next instructor, who’s also
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:59:04.757 --> 00:59:09.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Mark Noumair,
is going to give this stirring encouragement

00:59:09.295 --> 00:59:11.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“March On With Jehovah!”

00:59:13.633 --> 00:59:17.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young man received his assignment,

00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:20.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was not for the faint of heart.

00:59:20.673 --> 00:59:25.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would have to tell
about the desolation of cherished cities,

00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:29.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
the burning of Jehovah’s temple,
and the captivity of his people.

00:59:29.682 --> 00:59:34.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for delivering these messages
(which they were not easy),

00:59:34.587 --> 00:59:36.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would endure

00:59:36.256 --> 00:59:40.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
scathing and murderous attempts on his life.

00:59:42.028 --> 00:59:45.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, on top of that,

00:59:45.098 --> 00:59:48.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would experience
moments of discouragement,

00:59:48.801 --> 00:59:50.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
isolation,

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:53.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
self-doubt.

00:59:53.172 --> 00:59:57.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
When receiving his assignment,
this young man said:

00:59:57.210 --> 00:59:59.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah, I cannot do this.

00:59:59.746 --> 01:00:02.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just a boy.’

01:00:02.448 --> 01:00:05.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
The boy was from Anathoth,

01:00:08.588 --> 01:00:10.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his name was Jeremiah.

01:00:11.891 --> 01:00:15.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what would help him
be successful with this assignment?

01:00:15.828 --> 01:00:19.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be following and taking to heart

01:00:19.132 --> 01:00:23.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
the very points that Brother Fleegle
brought out about faith.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:28.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would need a deep, abiding faith
and trust in Jehovah.

01:00:28.308 --> 01:00:30.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in addition to that,

01:00:30.643 --> 01:00:33.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would need to learn how to march.

01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:40.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah was ready to enter
the front lines of the battle

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:46.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the battle to defend pure worship
against those who hate it.

01:00:46.926 --> 01:00:49.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like any good soldier,

01:00:49.128 --> 01:00:52.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the first things you learn
is how to march.

01:00:54.867 --> 01:00:58.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, marching is more challenging
than mere walking.

01:00:58.504 --> 01:01:01.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Marching requires determination.

01:01:03.142 --> 01:01:07.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
It requires stamina, endurance,

01:01:07.647 --> 01:01:10.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to keep moving forward

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:13.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a regular, steady step.

01:01:13.186 --> 01:01:17.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Jeremiah entered this battle,

01:01:17.623 --> 01:01:20.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would need to learn how to march.

01:01:22.795 --> 01:01:24.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would help him?

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:28.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recalling what was written in God’s Word
centuries before his time,

01:01:28.368 --> 01:01:32.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
words recorded at Deuteronomy 31:6.

01:01:32.138 --> 01:01:34.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to read these words to you.

01:01:35.742 --> 01:01:38.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
These words were so important to Jeremiah.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:42.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
The context was when Moses was encouraging

01:01:42.215 --> 01:01:44.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
confidence in Jehovah.

01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:47.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
The nation of Israel was ready
to enter into the Promised Land.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would face enemies.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:52.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would face a fight, a battle.

01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:57.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look at what Moses says
in verse 6 of Deuteronomy 31:

01:01:58.197 --> 01:02:00.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be courageous and strong.

01:02:00.733 --> 01:02:04.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid
or struck with terror before them,

01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:06.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for Jehovah your God

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:10.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is the one marching with you.

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:11.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[He’s marching with you.]

01:02:11.911 --> 01:02:15.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will neither desert you nor abandon you.”

01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:21.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Jehovah march alongside this boy?

01:02:22.855 --> 01:02:27.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Jeremiah 1:8,
Jehovah tells Jeremiah:

01:02:27.126 --> 01:02:31.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid
because of their appearance,

01:02:31.864 --> 01:02:35.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ‘I am with you to save you.’”

01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:36.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be afraid.

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:41.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
when a person marches with Jehovah,

01:02:41.073 --> 01:02:45.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see, Jehovah marches with him,

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:47.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
boosting him along, making him strong.

01:02:47.513 --> 01:02:49.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s as if Jehovah told Jeremiah,

01:02:49.582 --> 01:02:53.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t worry,
you just come and march with me.’

01:02:55.288 --> 01:02:58.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for the next 67 years,
that’s exactly what Jeremiah did

01:02:58.891 --> 01:03:00.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s strength.

01:03:00.893 --> 01:03:04.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what happened
in Jehovah’s strength.

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:07.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah preached to hard-hearted people,

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:10.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
including wicked kings,
corrupt priests, apostates.

01:03:10.903 --> 01:03:13.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did it, and as he marched,

01:03:13.272 --> 01:03:15.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saw Jehovah march with him.

01:03:15.808 --> 01:03:17.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was conscious of that fact.

01:03:20.279 --> 01:03:24.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saved him
when imprisoned in a dungeon.

01:03:25.618 --> 01:03:29.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah supplied him
a daily ration of food during a famine.

01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:32.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah rescued him from a cistern.

01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:34.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, this was real.

01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:37.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was tangible.
This was concrete.

01:03:37.597 --> 01:03:39.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t made-up.

01:03:39.298 --> 01:03:41.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was marching with him.

01:03:41.434 --> 01:03:44.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Jeremiah saw Jehovah’s support,

01:03:44.804 --> 01:03:47.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
it strengthened him
and it gave him more confidence,

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah marched with him.

01:03:49.942 --> 01:03:53.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Jeremiah was ready
for the next trial.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we bring this up?

01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:01.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because your situation
is very similar to Jeremiah’s.

01:04:02.955 --> 01:04:03.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:08.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with your Gilead training,
you are being put on the front lines.

01:04:10.162 --> 01:04:12.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to be asked
to defend pure worship,

01:04:12.732 --> 01:04:14.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe like you never have before.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:19.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want you to stay in the battle.

01:04:19.539 --> 01:04:22.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want you to keep marching.

01:04:22.475 --> 01:04:25.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, what if in your assignment,

01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:28.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
opposition turns into outright persecution?

01:04:30.249 --> 01:04:33.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or what if in your branch territory,

01:04:33.185 --> 01:04:36.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
you face political upheaval or war?

01:04:36.822 --> 01:04:39.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if you need

01:04:39.659 --> 01:04:42.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
to risk your lives

01:04:42.695 --> 01:04:45.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide relief

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:48.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
like our brothers in and around Ukraine
are doing?

01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:50.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if that happens?

01:04:51.804 --> 01:04:55.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your brothers will be looking to you
as an example.

01:04:55.575 --> 01:04:57.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you be able to set that example?

01:04:57.643 --> 01:04:59.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you maintain that example?

01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:01.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you can.

01:05:02.915 --> 01:05:06.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because when you march with Jehovah

01:05:06.085 --> 01:05:08.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
—now listen carefully

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:11.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you march with Jehovah,

01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:16.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
he does something very special for you
in moments of weakness.

01:05:17.396 --> 01:05:20.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, consider what happened to Jeremiah.

01:05:20.366 --> 01:05:23.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one point,
it got so bad that he wanted to quit.

01:05:23.402 --> 01:05:24.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m quitting.’

01:05:24.403 --> 01:05:26.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 20:9:

01:05:26.372 --> 01:05:28.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m not going to mention Jehovah’s name.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m not going to talk about it anymore.

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:31.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m discouraged.
I’m tired.

01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:34.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m exhausted.
I’m going to stop marching.’

01:05:35.781 --> 01:05:38.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was losing his focus.

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:42.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does Jehovah help him?
What did Jehovah do?

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he say, ‘Well, Jeremiah, that’s it.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:47.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re going to be exhausted,
I’ll find another prophet.’

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah did not do that.

01:05:50.596 --> 01:05:52.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah do?

01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:54.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is a thought
we want you to take to heart,

01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:59.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 20:11.

01:06:00.339 --> 01:06:03.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah help him to keep marching?

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:08.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Jehovah was with me

01:06:08.114 --> 01:06:10.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[like a what, friend?

01:06:10.883 --> 01:06:13.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like a brother?
No, no, no.]

01:06:13.686 --> 01:06:17.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
like a fearsome warrior.”

01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:21.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in what way
did Jehovah prove to be a fearsome warrior,

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
a mighty soldier,
standing right at Jeremiah’s side?

01:06:26.899 --> 01:06:28.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah do that?

01:06:29.869 --> 01:06:32.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what happens in battle?

01:06:32.505 --> 01:06:35.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a soldier sees
a fellow soldier stumble and fall,

01:06:35.574 --> 01:06:36.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does he do?

01:06:36.942 --> 01:06:39.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rushes to his side; he supports him;

01:06:39.211 --> 01:06:40.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
he grabs him;
they go together;

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wraps his arm around him,
and they move to safety together.

01:06:43.949 --> 01:06:47.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what Jehovah did for Jeremiah.

01:06:48.988 --> 01:06:51.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jeremiah tells us this

01:06:51.524 --> 01:06:53.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
in chapter 20, and in verse 7.

01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:55.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jeremiah say?

01:06:55.494 --> 01:06:57.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
He experienced this.

01:06:57.596 --> 01:06:59.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says:

01:06:59.632 --> 01:07:03.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You used your strength against me,

01:07:03.335 --> 01:07:05.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you prevailed.”

01:07:05.337 --> 01:07:07.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You used your strength against me.”

01:07:07.073 --> 01:07:08.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

01:07:10.409 --> 01:07:15.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah used his strength
against Jeremiah’s weakness.

01:07:15.414 --> 01:07:18.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing Jehovah do this for him

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
time and again, time and again,

01:07:20.419 --> 01:07:22.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
enabled Jeremiah to accomplish

01:07:22.688 --> 01:07:25.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he could have never accomplished
on his own.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the point we’re making for you.

01:07:28.694 --> 01:07:32.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these experiences
strengthen and transform

01:07:32.398 --> 01:07:34.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
his natural shyness,

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
his feelings of inadequacy,

01:07:36.836 --> 01:07:38.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his lack of confidence

01:07:38.838 --> 01:07:41.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
into ironlike boldness.

01:07:41.407 --> 01:07:44.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was with him
like a fearsome warrior.

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:47.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved the commission
he gave Jeremiah.

01:07:47.747 --> 01:07:50.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was working with Jeremiah
to fulfill this commission.

01:07:50.716 --> 01:07:53.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was precious to Jehovah.

01:07:53.285 --> 01:07:57.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like your commission,
it’s precious to Jehovah.

01:07:58.924 --> 01:08:02.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you can be assured
that Jehovah is going to do the same for you.

01:08:02.561 --> 01:08:05.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want you to have that confidence.

01:08:05.731 --> 01:08:08.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, one sister,

01:08:08.567 --> 01:08:11.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
who not long ago graduated from Gilead,

01:08:11.971 --> 01:08:14.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced this firsthand.

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:21.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after arriving in her assignment,
she was arrested.

01:08:21.147 --> 01:08:24.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister was held captive
in a dungeonlike prison.

01:08:26.152 --> 01:08:29.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during that time,
she was given meager rations of food

01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:33.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was subjected
to painful, prolonged punishment.

01:08:33.726 --> 01:08:35.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
How was she able to endure?

01:08:35.594 --> 01:08:37.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could she stay strong?

01:08:37.329 --> 01:08:38.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

01:08:38.464 --> 01:08:41.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
By marching with Jehovah.

01:08:41.066 --> 01:08:45.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she never lost sight of the fact
that she was part of an army of marchers.

01:08:45.504 --> 01:08:48.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was marching with the fearsome Warrior.

01:08:48.774 --> 01:08:50.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, this is what she said:

01:08:53.145 --> 01:08:56.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thinking about my Gilead classmates

01:08:56.515 --> 01:09:00.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and visualizing their faces gave me power.

01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:05.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I kept their smiling faces in front of me.

01:09:05.691 --> 01:09:08.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I imagined where each classmate sat

01:09:08.127 --> 01:09:10.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—each row from left to right—
front to back.

01:09:12.264 --> 01:09:17.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I recalled where they were from,
what work they did in their assignments.

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:21.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This made the time go by quickly,
and I felt no physical pain at all.

01:09:22.474 --> 01:09:26.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I sang in my head Kingdom songs.

01:09:26.212 --> 01:09:30.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The song I sang the most
was ‘Jehovah Is Your Name.’

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:33.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Another song that touched my heart deeply

01:09:33.686 --> 01:09:38.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was song number 38,
‘He Will Make You Strong.’

01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:41.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I made that song more personal

01:09:41.293 --> 01:09:45.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by replacing the pronoun ‘you’ with ‘me.’

01:09:45.531 --> 01:09:48.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This song helped me never to give up.

01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:52.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I had no Bible.

01:09:52.771 --> 01:09:55.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So each day, I meditated on Bible teachings

01:09:55.207 --> 01:09:59.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“such as everlasting life in Paradise
and a resurrection hope.

01:09:59.411 --> 01:10:02.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These meditations gave me deep inner joy

01:10:02.648 --> 01:10:07.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a calm that cannot be described.

01:10:07.019 --> 01:10:11.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At times, I thought about the possibility
of facing death,

01:10:11.023 --> 01:10:15.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the fear of death did not consume me.”

01:10:17.062 --> 01:10:20.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, she thought about the possibility
of facing death,

01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:25.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the fear of death did not consume her.

01:10:26.438 --> 01:10:30.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fearsome Warrior, Jehovah,
was marching with her.

01:10:30.109 --> 01:10:34.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
No prison walls, no bars
can block Jehovah from marching with her.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our sister was recently released
from prison.

01:10:42.054 --> 01:10:44.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever your trials,

01:10:44.089 --> 01:10:46.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t know
what trials you’re going to face.

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:49.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t know.
We don’t know.

01:10:49.228 --> 01:10:52.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
But reflect on how Jehovah supports you.

01:10:52.464 --> 01:10:54.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay in the battle.

01:10:54.233 --> 01:10:56.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you reflect
on how Jehovah supports you,

01:10:56.869 --> 01:10:59.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s tangible, it’s real, it’s concrete.

01:10:59.305 --> 01:11:00.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about that.

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:02.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will never stop marching with you.

01:11:03.842 --> 01:11:07.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, you are part of a large army.

01:11:07.479 --> 01:11:08.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not alone.

01:11:10.582 --> 01:11:14.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, when you see
a fellow worshipper struggling,

01:11:14.119 --> 01:11:16.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t ignore them.

01:11:16.121 --> 01:11:18.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help them not to fall behind.

01:11:18.457 --> 01:11:19.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help them.

01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:21.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help them.

01:11:21.126 --> 01:11:23.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re part of an army.

01:11:23.162 --> 01:11:25.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve been trained to do this.

01:11:25.264 --> 01:11:27.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what school taught you:

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:30.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be independent,
but to be interdependent,

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:35.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
not independen—interdependent
with your brothers and sisters.

01:11:35.441 --> 01:11:37.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s your job.

01:11:37.743 --> 01:11:39.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be quick to help them back up.

01:11:39.912 --> 01:11:42.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep marching with Jehovah.

01:11:42.748 --> 01:11:47.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although you don’t know
what challenges lie ahead,

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are prepared.

01:11:50.356 --> 01:11:54.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with your marching orders in hand,

01:11:54.159 --> 01:11:56.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
be courageous and strong,

01:11:56.729 --> 01:12:00.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that each trial you face,
each trial you endure,

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
will make you stronger for the next one.

01:12:04.036 --> 01:12:08.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be confident that you will always have
the fearsome Warrior,

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mighty Soldier marching by your side.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:13.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s there, Jehovah.

01:12:15.114 --> 01:12:17.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now go

01:12:17.883 --> 01:12:20.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever the battle may take you.

01:12:20.352 --> 01:12:22.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go,

01:12:22.021 --> 01:12:24.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be determined to fulfill your commission

01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:27.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support your brothers

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:31.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you march on with Jehovah.

01:12:40.873 --> 01:12:42.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a powerful encouragement

01:12:42.908 --> 01:12:45.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one that I’m sure you’ll remember
for many years to come!

01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:49.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
And students, maybe I need to apologize.

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:52.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t realize Anathoth
was going to be the buzz word.

01:12:53.919 --> 01:12:57.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, if I had realized that
in the beginning in my introduction,

01:12:57.456 --> 01:13:00.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would have said,
“We need to follow the example of Jesus,

01:13:00.259 --> 01:13:02.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who according to Matthew 16:14

01:13:02.895 --> 01:13:05.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
people thought was Jeremiah,
who was from Anathoth.”

01:13:06.932 --> 01:13:08.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
But anyway, you can take note of that.

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:12.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
But thank you again, Brother Noumair.

01:13:12.704 --> 01:13:16.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was
a very encouraging and stimulating talk.

01:13:17.576 --> 01:13:20.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although these talks
were directed to the Gilead graduates,

01:13:20.712 --> 01:13:23.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
they contain
beneficial lessons for all of us.

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:25.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you enjoyed Part 1.

01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:29.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parts 2 and 3 will be available on jw.org
later this month.

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:33.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our postcard is from the United States.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a large territory encompassing
a variety of landscapes.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:41.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are majestic mountains,

01:13:41.733 --> 01:13:43.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
twisting ravines,

01:13:43.902 --> 01:13:45.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
tropical islands,

01:13:45.971 --> 01:13:48.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
and vast deserts.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:52.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Across this varied land
resides an even greater diversity of people.

01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:57.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help all they can,

01:13:57.116 --> 01:14:01.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 1.2 million publishers
preach in 114 languages!

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:05.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether native speakers
or learners of a new language,

01:14:05.657 --> 01:14:07.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
publishers try to reach the heart.

01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:12.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the largest language groups
in the United States is Haitian Creole.

01:14:13.799 --> 01:14:18.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are approximately one million people
of Haitian descent in the branch territory

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:20.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
with over 10,000 publishers.

01:14:21.306 --> 01:14:24.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haitians are a vibrant people as expressed

01:14:24.309 --> 01:14:27.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their energetic dances,
their colorful clothing,

01:14:27.012 --> 01:14:29.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their delicious food.

01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:32.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just north of Miami, Florida,

01:14:32.351 --> 01:14:36.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a community referred to
as “Little Haiti.”

01:14:36.155 --> 01:14:40.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s here where the 80 publishers
of the West Haitian Creole Congregation

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:43.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
search for lovers of truth.

01:14:43.762 --> 01:14:46.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have witnessed
in parks and on street corners.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have written letters and focused

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:51.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the family members
of their Bible students.

01:14:51.236 --> 01:14:52.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation now

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:56.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
conducts on average 126 Bible studies!

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:59.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
With love, the brothers and sisters

01:14:59.511 --> 01:15:02.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the West Haitian Creole Congregation
of Miami, Florida,

01:15:02.514 --> 01:15:06.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their greetings
to the worldwide brotherhood!

01:15:07.219 --> 01:15:10.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:13.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
