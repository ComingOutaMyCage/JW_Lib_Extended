00:00:01 Welcome to JW Broadcasting® for December 2022!
00:00:24 On September 10th,
00:00:26 24 students reached a milestone
00:00:28 and graduated from the 152nd class of Gilead.
00:00:32 Many of the students were initially invited to attend the school,
00:00:35 but they patiently waited until COVID-19 restrictions eased.
00:00:40 Now, after five months of intensive study,
00:00:43 how will they apply their training?
00:00:46 How can they succeed in their assignments?
00:00:48 And how can they strengthen their brothers and sisters?
00:00:51 These questions and more are answered
00:00:53 in Part 1 of this Gilead graduation program.
00:00:59 Well, this day has arrived for you students.
00:01:02 I see you there smiling and looking forward to this program.
00:01:06 I’m sure it’s hard for you to believe that we’ve actually gotten to graduation day.
00:01:12 But we also know that you’re very keen and enthusiastic to get to your assignments,
00:01:17 whether you’re going back to where you came from
00:01:19 or you’re going to a new assignment.
00:01:21 Over the last few months, you’ve learned so much, haven’t you?
00:01:25 You’ve crammed that information into your mind and heart,
00:01:30 and now you have that ready to implement it
00:01:33 when you go to your assignments.
00:01:36 But we need to be careful
00:01:38 not only to be enthusiastic, keen, and zealous,
00:01:42 but also we need to be patient.
00:01:45 So we’d like to talk to you for a few moments about this theme
00:01:49 “Be Enthusiastic but Be Patient” as well.
00:01:54 Why so?
00:01:56 Well, when you go to your assignments with all this that you’ve learned,
00:02:00 you’re going to be tempted to try and implement it everywhere.
00:02:05 But remember, you’re not going to change the whole world in one day
00:02:09 or even the whole branch.
00:02:11 You see, it’s so easy to become overwhelmed
00:02:16 if we try to take on too much all at one time.
00:02:20 So that’s why it’s important to be enthusiastic
00:02:23 but also patient.
00:02:27 Our Lord Jesus Christ was an excellent example of this.
00:02:31 When Jesus came into the world,
00:02:33 the whole world needed to hear his message.
00:02:36 And yet, he had to wait some 30 years,
00:02:40 growing up according to Jehovah’s timetable, before he started his ministry.
00:02:45 So that took patience on his part, didn’t it?
00:02:48 But what about when Jesus started his ministry?
00:02:53 What was his focus?
00:02:55 You can imagine him looking around,
00:02:57 seeing all the things that needed to be done in the world at that point.
00:03:01 But let’s turn in our Bibles.
00:03:03 If you turn with me, please, to Matthew chapter 15
00:03:07 —Matthew 15:24,
00:03:10 and here Jesus said to his apostles:
00:03:14 “I was not sent to anyone
00:03:17 except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:03:22 That’s interesting.
00:03:23 Jesus here mentions he had a specific, limited assignment.
00:03:28 What was the assignment?
00:03:30 To go “to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:03:34 Now, if you turn back just a couple of chapters,
00:03:37 in chapter 10 of Matthew,
00:03:39 you’ll notice in verses 5 and 6 that when Jesus sent out his apostles,
00:03:44 what did he say to them?
00:03:46 “Do not go off into the road of the nations,
00:03:50 “and do not enter any Samaritan city;
00:03:54 “but instead, go continually
00:03:57 to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:04:01 So as Jesus sent out his apostles
00:04:04 in this particular instance,
00:04:06 what was he reminding them of?
00:04:09 He was telling them
00:04:11 that they likewise had a limited assignment,
00:04:14 a specific assignment.
00:04:16 They weren’t supposed to try
00:04:17 and do everything all at once
00:04:19 —to go to the Samaritans and to the Gentiles.
00:04:21 They were to focus
00:04:23 just on “the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:04:26 So when we think about this,
00:04:29 what do we learn from these two verses?
00:04:32 Well, first of all,
00:04:34 yes, the whole world needed to hear the message.
00:04:38 But what did Jesus do, and what did he expect of his apostles?
00:04:42 That they would recognize that they had a specific assignment.
00:04:47 They weren’t to be overwhelmed
00:04:49 by trying to think of changing the whole world at that point.
00:04:53 Jesus showed great trust in Jehovah.
00:04:56 He knew that Jehovah would gradually expand the message
00:05:01 and the reach of the message.
00:05:04 And, of course, we realize that at Pentecost there was an expansion
00:05:07 and then in 36 C.E., another expansion.
00:05:11 So, what does that mean for you?
00:05:14 You see, when you return to your assignment or you go to the new one,
00:05:18 there’s going to be an endless number of possibilities
00:05:22 where you can help others
00:05:25 —to stabilize and strengthen everyone.
00:05:28 But if you try to take everything on at once,
00:05:31 you’re going to wear yourself out
00:05:33 and probably wear out a whole lot of other people as well.
00:05:36 You know the English idiom “Don’t bite off more than you can chew.”
00:05:41 You see, gradually do the things that Jehovah has assigned you to do.
00:05:46 If you try to be too broad in what you do,
00:05:50 you may end up not accomplishing much at all
00:05:53 except just wearing yourself out.
00:05:55 But be patient just as Jesus was,
00:05:58 and recognize that each one of you will have a specific assignment.
00:06:02 And then try to work at that,
00:06:05 trusting that Jehovah will allow
00:06:07 your good example to benefit others,
00:06:10 and gradually the effects of your work will spread to others.
00:06:15 Now, an example of this is in the South Pacific,
00:06:19 if I could just tell you about that now.
00:06:21 When missionaries arrived in the South Pacific—
00:06:24 Let’s take, for example,
00:06:26 you might end up in a country
00:06:28 that has 100 inhabited islands.
00:06:31 Now you’re a new missionary.
00:06:33 I remember the feeling.
00:06:35 And then you find out there are only ten islands
00:06:39 that have Jehovah’s Witnesses on them
00:06:41 —ten islands that have publishers and congregations.
00:06:45 So there are 90 that don’t.
00:06:47 So, what do you think the normal enthusiastic response is?
00:06:51 “Oh, let’s get a boat. We have to get a boat!
00:06:54 “We must visit all the 90 islands.
00:06:56 Oh, that needs to be done now, immediately!”
00:07:00 Well, usually you’re assigned to one congregation
00:07:04 in one area.
00:07:06 Now, what’s the point?
00:07:07 What normally happens?
00:07:09 Well, you see, if you were to get a boat
00:07:11 (and there’s nothing wrong with getting a boat
00:07:13 or visiting other islands)
00:07:15 and if that becomes your focus and you neglect your assignment,
00:07:19 how can you follow up on all the interest that you may find on those 90 islands?
00:07:23 It’s not just enough to go and give them some magazines,
00:07:26 but you need to be there with them,
00:07:29 build them up, and form congregations.
00:07:32 So normally what happens?
00:07:34 Well, it’s amazing to see missionaries and others
00:07:38 who work in maybe larger city areas;
00:07:42 they work diligently at their assignments.
00:07:45 But then maybe others from different islands
00:07:48 come to visit that city the missionaries are in,
00:07:52 and they get contacted.
00:07:53 They show an interest, they start to study,
00:07:55 and they return to their home islands.
00:07:58 And what happens?
00:07:59 Gradually, the work spreads out to all these islands.
00:08:03 So, what’s the point?
00:08:05 Don’t feel that you have to take on everything.
00:08:09 Focus as Jesus did on the limited assignment you have.
00:08:13 But then along the way, you may be surprised at what happens.
00:08:19 Now, that’s exactly what happened to Jesus.
00:08:22 Let’s go back to Matthew chapter 15.
00:08:26 Remember, what was the assignment that Jesus had?
00:08:30 In verse 24,
00:08:32 he mentioned “Israel.”
00:08:34 Now, looking at this map, we see at that time
00:08:38 there was actually a border around that area
00:08:42 that we could say was his territory assignment.
00:08:45 But when Jesus said these words,
00:08:48 where was he?
00:08:49 Do you remember?
00:08:50 Let’s look in verse 21:
00:08:53 “Jesus now went into the region
00:08:55 of Tyre and Sidon.”
00:08:58 So when you look at the map,
00:09:00 where was Tyre and Sidon?
00:09:03 What do you notice?
00:09:04 You see, he wasn’t in his territory.
00:09:07 He was out among the Gentiles.
00:09:10 Why?
00:09:12 Well, when we look at the parallel account
00:09:14 that’s mentioned in Mark chapter 7,
00:09:16 it tells us that Jesus wanted some time alone with his apostles,
00:09:21 some downtime because there were so many crowds;
00:09:24 they were so busy.
00:09:25 Now, I’m sure all of us can understand that feeling Jesus had.
00:09:29 So he took them out of that general area
00:09:32 to this territory
00:09:34 that was beyond what he would normally preach in
00:09:37 to have some quiet time together.
00:09:39 But what happened?
00:09:41 Well, the account tells us that there was a Syrophoenician woman,
00:09:45 perhaps (as the study notes help us to see)
00:09:47 from a Greek background
00:09:49 as far as her nationality went,
00:09:51 but maybe she was a citizen
00:09:54 or an inhabitant of that area,
00:09:56 the Syrophoenician area.
00:09:59 So this woman approached Jesus, pleading with him.
00:10:02 Now, she didn’t look like a Jewish person.
00:10:05 She probably didn’t even speak Hebrew.
00:10:08 She certainly wasn’t in the category
00:10:11 of the lost ones of the house of Israel.
00:10:14 So Jesus,
00:10:16 initially when she started to make these efforts to talk to him,
00:10:19 mentioned this to his apostles in verse 24:
00:10:23 ‘That’s our assignment.’
00:10:25 But notice that this was a little different
00:10:28 in the sense that this woman
00:10:31 showed an appreciation for who Jesus was.
00:10:34 Notice in verse 22, she said:
00:10:38 “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David.”
00:10:42 Now, here’s a Gentile woman.
00:10:45 Should she really know who David was?
00:10:47 And by saying “Son of David,”
00:10:50 as the study note indicates, perhaps she was showing faith
00:10:54 in the fact that Jesus is the Messiah.
00:10:58 So she wasn’t your average Syrophoenician person.
00:11:02 What did Jesus do?
00:11:03 Well, he tested her a little.
00:11:05 He did emphasize the fact that in a household
00:11:09 you first of all feed the children, the family,
00:11:13 and then the little dogs get fed afterward.
00:11:16 And perhaps he was playing on words there.
00:11:18 It’s interesting.
00:11:19 We’re not sure what language Jesus was speaking to her.
00:11:22 The Watchtower  did say that Jesus
00:11:24 perhaps did understand Greek and use it at times.
00:11:28 Why, his apostles obviously understood some Greek.
00:11:30 They wrote some of the books of the Bible in Greek.
00:11:33 But whatever the case, the record of this is written
00:11:37 —the inspired record— in Greek,
00:11:39 and it uses this term “little dogs.”
00:11:43 Was that offensive?
00:11:44 No.
00:11:45 As it’s mentioned, it was an affectionate term
00:11:48 like saying “puppies” or “pets.”
00:11:51 So whatever the case,
00:11:53 he must have looked very friendly, perhaps had a smile on his face,
00:11:57 because she was not deterred.
00:12:00 What was Jesus’ reaction?
00:12:02 Well, he acknowledged his territory, his assignment.
00:12:05 But then in verse 28, he said,
00:12:08 “O woman, great is your faith;
00:12:10 let it happen to you as you wish.”
00:12:15 Is this the only time that Jesus did something like this
00:12:18 for a non-Jewish person?
00:12:20 Remember in John chapter 4,
00:12:23 not only do we have this case of the Syrophoenician woman,
00:12:26 but in John chapter 4, we’re told about the Samaritan woman.
00:12:30 This non-Jewish person was witnessed to,
00:12:34 and then even members of her village
00:12:38 accepted Jesus as the Messiah.
00:12:41 And then what about the Roman army officer
00:12:45 that Jesus was able to help?
00:12:47 And Jesus mentioned
00:12:48 that he hadn’t even seen
00:12:50 that type of faith in all of Israel.
00:12:53 So, what lesson do we learn from this?
00:12:57 Well, Jesus focused on his assignment.
00:13:00 He always acknowledged what he was assigned to do.
00:13:04 But when opportunities came up along the way
00:13:08 to help those who weren’t necessarily in his assignment,
00:13:13 he still gave them some help
00:13:14 because they were genuine persons who needed help.
00:13:18 Yes, although Jesus realized it wasn’t yet the time to expand the work,
00:13:23 he was willing to reach out to these ones as well.
00:13:27 So, what’s the lesson for all of us?
00:13:30 Well, when you go to your assignments, you will have specific assignments.
00:13:35 Now, if it’s in a Bethel or in the field,
00:13:38 you’ll know what your assignment is.
00:13:41 So don’t start looking at all the other assignments that are around
00:13:44 and how you can help them and what you need to do
00:13:47 and say, “Oh, why don’t they change?”
00:13:49 I mean, you’ve changed a lot in the last few months;
00:13:52 but remember, they haven’t.
00:13:54 And they survived without you.
00:13:59 So, what’s the key?
00:14:01 Focus on your assignment.
00:14:05 Be zealous, be enthusiastic,
00:14:08 but also be patient.
00:14:10 Yes, have trust in Jehovah
00:14:13 that if you focus on your assignment, you work hard,
00:14:16 you take up whatever opportunities come your way along the way,
00:14:20 then you can be sure you will be blessed
00:14:22 because you’re enthusiastic but also patient.
00:14:27 Well, now with those thoughts in mind,
00:14:35 we have a very interesting program ahead of us.
00:14:38 First up, we have Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the Governing Body.
00:14:41 And Brother Cook is going to talk to you on the theme
00:14:45 “Follow the Steps That Lead to Blessings.”
00:14:48 Brother Cook, please.
00:14:55 To begin, I’d like to share a personal experience with you.
00:15:00 When I was told that I was appointed to be a member of the Governing Body,
00:15:05 one of the brothers who informed me said:
00:15:09 “With this assignment, you’ll experience
00:15:11 “a great increase in responsibility.
00:15:14 “But you’ll also see a corresponding increase
00:15:17 “in Jehovah’s spirit to help you.
00:15:20 It will not be too much for you.”
00:15:23 Well, those words were very, very reassuring to me.
00:15:28 And the fact is that all of us
00:15:31 (no matter who we are) serving Jehovah faithfully
00:15:34 must rely on his help
00:15:37 to succeed in serving him.
00:15:40 Now, how do we show this and receive his help?
00:15:43 There are a number of ways.
00:15:45 We’re going to focus on three of them.
00:15:47 They are these: Follow direction, show faith,
00:15:51 and use common sense, or the thinking ability,
00:15:55 that Jehovah has given to us.
00:15:57 So let’s consider the first step.
00:16:00 Sometimes all that’s required to receive Jehovah’s blessing on our work
00:16:05 is to follow simple, clear direction.
00:16:08 Now, here’s a Bible example of that.
00:16:10 It’s found in Mark chapter 14
00:16:13 —Mark chapter 14.
00:16:15 Now, you’ll recall from this account
00:16:17 that God’s Son directed two of his disciples
00:16:21 to go into Jerusalem and to prepare a large,
00:16:25 furnished upper room for the Passover.
00:16:28 His directions were specific.
00:16:30 For instance, Jesus said that they would meet
00:16:32 ‘a man carrying a large, earthenware jar,
00:16:36 and they were to follow him.’
00:16:38 And then starting in verse 14, Jesus added this,
00:16:43 he said: “Wherever he goes inside, say to the master of the house,
00:16:47 “‘The Teacher says: “Where is the guest room
00:16:50 “where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’
00:16:53 “And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready.
00:16:57 “Prepare it for us there.
00:16:59 “So the disciples went out, and they entered the city
00:17:02 “and found it just as he said to them,
00:17:05 and they prepared for the Passover.”
00:17:09 So the directions were simple, right?
00:17:12 They were told where they should go,
00:17:14 who they should follow, what they were to say,
00:17:17 and what they were to do.
00:17:19 And the two disciples promptly followed that direction,
00:17:22 and of course, their obedience brought many blessings, as we know.
00:17:27 Well, what practical lesson can you draw from this?
00:17:31 The lesson: Sometimes all that is needed in serving Jehovah
00:17:35 is to follow simple, clear direction.
00:17:38 You’ll have many opportunities to do so in your assignments.
00:17:42 Follow clear direction, and look for Jehovah’s blessing on it.
00:17:48 But now, on the other hand, you might be asked to care for something
00:17:51 that’s far more involved than that.
00:17:54 For example, what if you’re asked to assist someone
00:17:57 who’s known to be difficult to deal with?
00:18:02 Or you’re asked to care for a work-related problem
00:18:06 that others have not been able to solve.
00:18:10 You’re the one selected because you’ve had the training.
00:18:14 In such a case, what will help you?
00:18:16 Your strong faith—the next step.
00:18:19 The fact is that at times we need to show added faith to fulfill our assignments.
00:18:23 True?
00:18:24 Consider the example of Ananias.
00:18:26 Now, he too was a man of faith,
00:18:28 but he faced a challenge that required even more of him,
00:18:31 and we read about it in Acts chapter 9.
00:18:35 We’ll begin with verse 10 —Acts 9:10—
00:18:39 it says: “There was a disciple named Ananias in Damascus,
00:18:43 “and the Lord said to him in a vision: ‘Ananias!’
00:18:46 “He said: ‘Here I am, Lord.’
00:18:48 “The Lord said to him: ‘Get up, go to the street called Straight,
00:18:52 “‘and look for a man named Saul, from Tarsus,
00:18:55 “‘at the house of Judas.
00:18:57 “‘For look! he is praying,
00:18:59 “‘and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias
00:19:02 “come in and lay his hands on him so that he may recover sight.’
00:19:06 “But Ananias answered: ‘Lord,
00:19:08 “‘I have heard from many about this man,
00:19:12 “‘about all the harm he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem.
00:19:17 “‘And here he has authority from the chief priests
00:19:19 “to arrest all those calling on your name.’
00:19:22 “But the Lord said to him: ‘Go! because this man
00:19:25 “‘is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations
00:19:29 “‘as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.
00:19:32 “‘For I will show him plainly how many things
00:19:35 he must suffer for my name.’”
00:19:39 Well, the direction was clear.
00:19:41 Where should Ananias go? To the street called Straight.
00:19:45 Who was he looking for? A man named Saul.
00:19:48 What house is he in? The house of Judas.
00:19:51 Ananias was even told what Saul was doing.
00:19:54 He was praying.
00:19:56 Then Ananias was told what he should do.
00:20:00 He was to lay his hands on him so that he would recover sight.
00:20:04 Simple, right?
00:20:05 Jesus would do the rest.
00:20:07 What a great example of giving clear direction!
00:20:12 But here is where Ananias needed to stir up more faith.
00:20:16 The man he was to visit had severely persecuted
00:20:19 the holy ones in Jerusalem.
00:20:21 And speaking to the Lord, Ananias added
00:20:23 that this man “has authority from the chief priests
00:20:27 to arrest all those calling on your name.”
00:20:30 Well, talk about stating the obvious to Jesus.
00:20:35 The point is that Ananias had a moment
00:20:38 where he was overwhelmed by the weight of the assignment.
00:20:40 That’s just what happened.
00:20:42 What would help him? More faith.
00:20:44 And Jesus knew how to draw it up in that dear man.
00:20:47 Look again at Jesus’ reply.
00:20:49 He simply restated his command: “Go.”
00:20:53 Then Jesus said that “this man is a chosen vessel to me
00:20:57 “to bear my name to the nations
00:20:59 as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.”
00:21:03 Now, Jesus added something there, didn’t he?
00:21:07 He pointed to the future.
00:21:08 What was he doing?
00:21:10 He was helping Ananias to look ahead, see.
00:21:14 And doing this evidently prompted Ananias
00:21:17 to show even more faith, which is what he needed.
00:21:20 How do we know this?
00:21:22 Well, look at what he said to Saul.
00:21:24 On meeting Saul, verse 17 tells us
00:21:27 that Ananias called him “brother.”
00:21:30 His initial hesitation had changed
00:21:32 into putting his full faith and trust
00:21:35 in Jesus’ direction.
00:21:37 Well, like Ananias, as you face challenges in the future
00:21:41 (and they will come; they come upon all of us),
00:21:44 have strong faith that Jehovah sees what is needed,
00:21:48 and he and his dear Son will help you.
00:21:51 Keep the big picture in mind,
00:21:53 and look to the blessings ahead for your hard work.
00:21:57 Jehovah will always bless your strong faith in him.
00:22:02 Well, so far we’ve looked at the need to follow clear direction
00:22:05 and to show strong faith.
00:22:07 Now we’re going to add another step:
00:22:09 Use common sense, or thinking ability.
00:22:13 Our Bible example—Elijah.
00:22:16 In this account, Elijah has traveled to Zarephath,
00:22:19 a Phoenician coastal town.
00:22:22 What was his business there?
00:22:24 Well, the land was in the grip of a long drought,
00:22:27 and Jehovah would help his prophet
00:22:29 by means of someone in that town.
00:22:32 Elijah was told: “Look!
00:22:34 I will command a widow there to supply you with food.”
00:22:38 It appears that he gave no other details about the widow than that.
00:22:42 So how would Elijah find her?
00:22:45 Would Elijah look for the wealthiest widow to care for his needs?
00:22:49 Or would he use common sense and thinking ability along with his faith?
00:22:54 Let’s see what Elijah does at 1 Kings chapter 17.
00:22:59 And we’re going to read verse 10 —First Kings 17:10,
00:23:02 it says: “So he [Elijah] rose up and went to Zarephath.
00:23:07 “When he came to the entrance of the city,
00:23:10 “there was a widow gathering pieces of wood.
00:23:13 “So he called to her and said:
00:23:15 ‘Please, bring me a little water in a cup so that I may drink.’”
00:23:21 So then what did Elijah do?
00:23:24 Evidently, he approached the very first widow he met.
00:23:28 And she was not a wealthy widow, but a poor one.
00:23:32 In fact, it says Elijah had not yet passed
00:23:35 beyond the entrance of the city.
00:23:38 What does this tell us about Elijah?
00:23:41 First, he showed no prejudice
00:23:43 in following through on Jehovah’s direction, did he?
00:23:46 And second, he added thinking ability
00:23:50 to his obedience and faith.
00:23:52 How so?
00:23:54 Well, common sense would tell him to show his faith
00:23:57 and start looking with the very first widow he met.
00:24:01 Elijah obviously had confidence
00:24:04 that Jehovah would make his choice clear.
00:24:07 His obedience, faith, and good sense were rewarded
00:24:10 because that widow was Jehovah’s choice.
00:24:14 Now, surely holy spirit guided Elijah,
00:24:17 but we can’t ignore the faith and clear thinking ability
00:24:20 that Elijah developed as he obediently did God’s will.
00:24:25 After all, prior to that widow, Jehovah used birds
00:24:28 to carry food to his prophet.
00:24:30 Surely Jehovah could use a poor widow as well.
00:24:34 What’s the lesson for you and for all of us?
00:24:37 Sometimes we’re given much to go on
00:24:40 when we receive an assignment
00:24:42 and, at other times, frankly, maybe not so much.
00:24:46 In such a case, our faith and clear thinking ability
00:24:50 remind us to trust in Jehovah
00:24:53 and to look for his guidance as we go forward in doing his will.
00:24:58 Jehovah will always help you dear friends at the right time.
00:25:03 So then, as our examples show, promptly obey,
00:25:06 show strong faith, and use common sense and thinking ability
00:25:11 in our service to our dear heavenly Father.
00:25:14 Remembering such lessons will help you
00:25:17 as you support Jehovah’s work
00:25:19 in your respective branches.
00:25:22 Jehovah gives power beyond what is normal
00:25:25 to those who rely on him
00:25:27 and follow the steps that lead to blessings.
00:25:31 And we are confident that this will always be true of you.
00:25:44 Thank you very much, Brother Cook.
00:25:45 You clearly helped us to see the steps that are needed
00:25:49 for us to gain blessings.
00:25:52 Well, now our next speaker on the program
00:25:54 is Brother Jeffrey Winder, who is a helper to the Personnel Committee.
00:25:59 And Brother Winder is going to discuss with us this very interesting question,
00:26:03 “How Close Can You Be?”
00:26:07 How would you students answer this question:
00:26:11 Do you feel closer to Jehovah now
00:26:15 than you did before your Gilead training began?
00:26:19 The answer is a resounding yes, isn’t it?
00:26:24 Maybe you can relate to these comments
00:26:26 of graduates of past classes of Gilead.
00:26:30 One brother said: “Absolutely, yes!
00:26:33 “I believe I now experience more fully
00:26:36 “what it means to walk with God
00:26:39 “and know and rely upon him as a close Friend,
00:26:43 not merely someone I turn and look up to in prayer.”
00:26:48 A sister said: “Gilead definitely drew me closer to Jehovah.
00:26:53 “The way we studied the Scriptures with intensity
00:26:56 truly made me feel like the Bible was a letter Jehovah wrote to me.”
00:27:02 Another brother said: “Jehovah communicated with such clarity,
00:27:07 “which made it real and personal.
00:27:11 “It made me feel closer to Jehovah than ever before,
00:27:15 and that feeling will never be forgotten.”
00:27:19 Well, unquestionably, your deep study of God’s Word during Gilead
00:27:23 drew you closer to Jehovah.
00:27:27 But here’s the question,
00:27:29 How close can you be?
00:27:32 How close can your relationship with Jehovah get?
00:27:35 You saw it leap forward in five months of deep Bible study, but is there a limit?
00:27:40 Is there more? Will you ever get done?
00:27:44 Consider two points that answer that question.
00:27:47 The first one is found in the book of James chapter 4,
00:27:53 and let’s read together the first part of verse 8.
00:27:57 And let’s read it with that question in mind:
00:27:59 Is there any limit to how close our relationship with Jehovah could be?
00:28:06 James 4:8 says:
00:28:08 “Draw close to God,
00:28:10 and he will draw close to you.”
00:28:16 So is there any limit indicated here?
00:28:19 Well, it is true that in English this phrase to “draw close to” someone
00:28:24 could be applied in a physical sense
00:28:26 —actually standing next to someone.
00:28:28 And in that case, there is a limit.
00:28:29 You can only stand so close to someone.
00:28:32 But that’s not really the sense of James 4:8, is it?
00:28:36 Rather, it’s in this sense: When we talk about our close friends,
00:28:41 we’re not talking about those that are nearest in proximity.
00:28:44 We’re talking about the depth of our relationship,
00:28:47 the closeness of our friendship.
00:28:50 And so then to “draw close to God” then means
00:28:52 to strengthen our relationship, strengthen our friendship, with him.
00:28:57 And then looking at the verse, does it appear that there’s any limit
00:29:01 to how close that relationship can get?
00:29:04 The implication is that as long as we keep drawing close to Jehovah,
00:29:08 then he’ll keep drawing close to us.
00:29:12 And that takes us to our second point,
00:29:15 and that is the real life example of God’s Son,
00:29:19 because Jesus drew close to Jehovah.
00:29:21 Clearly, he was taught by Jehovah.
00:29:24 Remember Isaiah 50:4,
00:29:26 regarding Jesus’ prehuman existence, where he said:
00:29:29 “He awakens me morning by morning;
00:29:32 he awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones.”
00:29:37 Does that sound a bit like your Gilead training?
00:29:39 ‘Morning by morning Jehovah was awakening your ear.’
00:29:43 Yet, Jesus wasn’t instructed by Jehovah for five months;
00:29:47 he was instructed for billions of years.
00:29:52 And during all that time,
00:29:54 his relationship with his Father continued to grow and deepen.
00:30:01 So, then, we put it all together.
00:30:03 You saw your relationship with Jehovah grow significantly
00:30:07 in five months of deep Bible study.
00:30:10 James 4:8 encourages us to just keep drawing close to Jehovah.
00:30:14 And Jesus did so for billions of years,
00:30:17 and look at how close his relationship with Jehovah is.
00:30:21 So, then, what’s the answer?
00:30:23 How close can you be to Jehovah?
00:30:28 The potential for your relationship with Jehovah to deepen
00:30:32 is endless.
00:30:36 Well, that’s just wonderful to contemplate, isn’t it?
00:30:39 But let’s make some application
00:30:41 because this really becomes a very important overall lesson
00:30:45 that you take with you from your Gilead experience:
00:30:48 That is how your deep Bible study
00:30:50 affected your relationship with Jehovah.
00:30:53 And one of the reasons why this is such an important lesson
00:30:56 is because your success in your assignment
00:31:00 is directly connected to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah.
00:31:06 Your success in your assignment
00:31:08 is directly connected to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah.
00:31:13 Now, why can we say that?
00:31:15 It’s because of what takes place
00:31:18 when we draw close to Jehovah through a study of his Word.
00:31:22 Turn with me, please, to the book of Psalms,
00:31:25 and we’ll read the 25th Psalm
00:31:30 in verse 4
00:31:35 —Psalm 25:4.
00:31:37 It says:
00:31:38 “Make me know your ways, O Jehovah;
00:31:43 teach me your paths.”
00:31:46 This is what’s happening when we study God’s Word, isn’t it?
00:31:49 We are coming to know Jehovah God’s ways.
00:31:52 The Watchtower  once said it this way.
00:31:54 It said: “As we get a deeper and deeper understanding of God’s Word,
00:31:59 we become imbued with God’s way of thinking.”
00:32:04 “We become imbued with God’s way of thinking.”
00:32:08 The dictionary said that the word
00:32:10 “imbue implies the introduction of a quality
00:32:14 that fills and permeates the whole being,”
00:32:18 so like dyeing a garment or leavening bread.
00:32:23 But here we’re talking about being imbued with God’s thinking,
00:32:26 that maybe God’s thinking would fill and permeate our whole being.
00:32:32 Is that possible?
00:32:35 Think back to the example of Jesus.
00:32:38 As we discussed, Jesus drew close to Jehovah.
00:32:40 He was taught by Jehovah for billions of years.
00:32:43 And what was happening during that whole time?
00:32:47 He was being imbued with Jehovah God’s thinking.
00:32:51 And it so permeated him that when he was on earth,
00:32:55 he could say at John 14:9:
00:32:57 “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.”
00:33:01 So in other words, everything that Jesus said,
00:33:04 everything that he did while on earth in every situation,
00:33:08 well, we could imagine Jehovah doing and saying those very things.
00:33:15 And that is why the success of your assignment
00:33:20 is directly connected to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah.
00:33:24 The more you draw close to Jehovah through a study of his Word,
00:33:28 then the more you are imbued with his thinking
00:33:31 and the more then you will do, or act,
00:33:35 and say things as Jehovah would.
00:33:39 And so how does this play out?
00:33:41 Well, in your assignment,
00:33:43 if you have the privilege to contribute to significant decisions
00:33:48 that will affect others in your department
00:33:51 or at the branch or in the field even,
00:33:54 my, you want to be guided by Jehovah’s thinking, don’t you?
00:33:58 You want to do things as he would do them.
00:34:01 Well, the closer you are to Jehovah, the deeper that relationship is,
00:34:05 the more your decisions will mirror his.
00:34:11 But, of course, we know strengthening and stabilizing others
00:34:14 isn’t always done in big, grand gestures like that
00:34:17 —big decisions, new organizational arrangements.
00:34:20 Quite often it’s the day-to-day interactions with others
00:34:23 that really encourage them.
00:34:25 And isn’t it true that we learn so much
00:34:28 from those intimate conversations that Jesus had with others,
00:34:32 or seemingly incidental interactions that he had with others,
00:34:36 that the Bible records?
00:34:39 Well, you will strengthen others in similar ways.
00:34:42 For example,
00:34:44 when you are guided by Jehovah’s thinking in personal matters,
00:34:49 such as in your choice of dress and grooming,
00:34:52 well, others will certainly notice that
00:34:55 and that will strengthen their resolve
00:34:57 to make good decisions in these personal areas.
00:35:00 When you are guided by Jehovah’s thinking in the use of your time,
00:35:05 as busy as you will be
00:35:07 —when the friends see you in the ministry,
00:35:09 at the meetings, working hard in your assignment—
00:35:11 they will take notice of that
00:35:13 and that will strengthen their resolve to make good priorities in their life.
00:35:19 Every time you steer a negative conversation to the positive,
00:35:22 every time you show a willingness to do humble tasks,
00:35:26 every time you take the time to get the other side of the story
00:35:29 before rendering judgment
00:35:31 —yes, in all these areas of your daily life,
00:35:35 you give evidence that you have drawn close to Jehovah,
00:35:38 you have been imbued with his thinking,
00:35:40 and you are acting as Jehovah would.
00:35:44 And in that case,
00:35:46 you absolutely will strengthen and stabilize your brothers!
00:35:53 Well, we love you
00:35:55 for your relationship with Jehovah.
00:35:59 And we encourage you to take this lesson of Gilead with you
00:36:03 —the effect that your deep Bible study had on your relationship with Jehovah—
00:36:07 and keep drawing close to him.
00:36:10 The potential is endless,
00:36:12 and this is what will ensure your success.
00:36:17 Well, may the rich blessing of Jehovah, your Friend, be with you
00:36:21 as you use your Gilead training in the assignments he has given you.
00:36:32 Well, I’m sure we all agree that was a beautiful answer
00:36:35 to the question, “How Close Can You Be?”
00:36:38 And all of us feel close to Jehovah,
00:36:41 but what a wonderful encouragement for us to draw ever closer to him!
00:36:47 The next brother, who’s going to give you some words of encouragement,
00:36:50 has a very intriguing theme
00:36:52 “Buy a Field in Anathoth.”
00:36:56 Brother Gage Fleegle, who’s a helper to the Service Committee,
00:37:01 is going to develop this theme “Buy a Field in Anathoth.”
00:37:08 The year was 608 B.C.E.
00:37:12 The prophet Jeremiah had already served
00:37:14 nearly 40 years faithfully,
00:37:17 and now he “was confined in the Courtyard of the Guard” in Jerusalem.
00:37:22 Jerusalem’s walls were being battered by the Babylonians.
00:37:26 In less than a year,
00:37:28 the entire city would be completely destroyed.
00:37:31 Jeremiah had to weather the storm.
00:37:33 There was no way out. There was no place for him to go.
00:37:35 He was under lockdown.
00:37:38 Well, have you ever felt like Jeremiah
00:37:41 —as if the world was caving in on you?
00:37:45 Maybe it was a serious health scare,
00:37:48 the health of a loved one, the death of a loved one,
00:37:54 or maybe COVID-19 has made you feel boxed in.
00:37:58 Some of our brothers, just like Jeremiah, have faced persecution or imprisonment,
00:38:03 and that might be our lot before the end of this system of things.
00:38:07 Well, what will help you students
00:38:09 —in fact, all of us—
00:38:11 during these critical last days
00:38:13 when we face personal trials, or adversity?
00:38:16 I invite you to open to Jeremiah chapter 32.
00:38:19 Let’s consider a dramatic illustration in the life of Jeremiah.
00:38:24 Now, Jeremiah is under lockdown.
00:38:27 Jeremiah chapter 32,
00:38:29 let’s read verses 6-8:
00:38:33 “Jeremiah said: ‘The word of Jehovah has come to me, saying,
00:38:37 “‘“Here Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say:
00:38:42 “‘“‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth,
00:38:44 because you have the first right to repurchase it.’”’”
00:38:47 Verse 8 says: “Hanamel the son of my uncle came to me,
00:38:50 “just as Jehovah had said, into the Courtyard of the Guard,
00:38:54 “and he said to me: ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth,
00:38:57 “‘in the land of Benjamin, for you have the right to take possession of it
00:39:00 “‘and to repurchase it.
00:39:01 “Buy it for yourself.’
00:39:04 At that I knew that this was by the word of Jehovah.”
00:39:09 What was Jehovah’s instruction to Jeremiah?
00:39:11 Buy a field.
00:39:13 Buy a field?
00:39:15 Right now, with the Babylonians beating on the door?
00:39:18 Jeremiah might have thought,
00:39:20 ‘I need an escape plan, not a field
00:39:23 —of all places, Anathoth?’
00:39:25 Where was Anathoth?
00:39:27 Well, Jeremiah knew exactly where it was
00:39:29 —just a few miles north-northeast of Jerusalem.
00:39:33 He was born there into a priestly family.
00:39:36 Did he have pleasant memories of his past in Anathoth as a youth?
00:39:41 Very likely.
00:39:42 But now that was a distant memory.
00:39:45 More recently, men of Anathoth, possibly some of Jeremiah’s own relatives,
00:39:49 threatened to kill him because of his prophesying.
00:39:53 Well, did Jeremiah obey
00:39:55 in spite of any personal feelings he might have had?
00:39:59 Jeremiah always obeyed,
00:40:02 even previously when Jehovah told him not to take a wife or to have children.
00:40:07 Well, what did he do in this situation?
00:40:09 Verses 9 and 10:
00:40:11 “So I bought the field in Anathoth from Hanamel the son of my uncle.
00:40:16 “I weighed out the money to him, seven shekels and ten silver pieces.
00:40:20 “Then I recorded it in a deed, affixed the seal,
00:40:23 called in witnesses, and weighed the money in the scales.”
00:40:27 Jeremiah could have worked in the Legal Department.
00:40:31 Well, he carried out the legal transaction,
00:40:34 the legal requirements of the transaction.
00:40:37 He recorded the transaction in two deeds
00:40:39 —one sealed, one unsealed—
00:40:41 complete transparency in this situation.
00:40:45 Why did Jehovah ask Jeremiah to buy a field in Anathoth?
00:40:50 Jeremiah already had complete faith that, yes, Jehovah’s word would be restored
00:40:55 —when 70 years had transpired, the Jews would return to their homeland.
00:40:59 But now Jehovah reinforced Jeremiah’s faith
00:41:03 by giving him something specific to think about.
00:41:06 Jeremiah could imagine the time
00:41:07 when buying and selling would again occur in Israel.
00:41:12 Well, was Jeremiah’s faith well-placed in Jehovah’s promise?
00:41:18 Absolutely.
00:41:19 Ezra later documented that 128 men of Anathoth
00:41:23 were among the first group of those returning from Babylonian exile.
00:41:29 Jehovah’s word always comes true.
00:41:34 Well, how might we —how might you—
00:41:38 “buy a field in Anathoth”?
00:41:40 Well, we’re not expecting you to go out and purchase
00:41:43 a piece of property in a place called Anathoth.
00:41:46 No.
00:41:47 We find a clue, though, in Hebrews chapter 11
00:41:51 —Hebrews 11:1:
00:41:55 “Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for,
00:42:00 the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.”
00:42:06 The Simple English Bible  renders it this way:
00:42:09 “Faith is the title-deed
00:42:12 to the things we hope for.”
00:42:15 Now, most of us in special full-time service, we don’t own property.
00:42:19 But we may have the title to a car.
00:42:22 What does that mean?
00:42:23 That means that car, that vehicle, belongs to us personally.
00:42:28 Our faith is the “title-deed” of good things to come,
00:42:31 a guarantee of future realities.
00:42:34 Jeremiah had a “title-deed.”
00:42:36 We have a “title-deed” of faith.
00:42:39 So how do we “buy a field in Anathoth”?
00:42:42 It’s not a type-antitype situation; it’s just an illustration.
00:42:47 In the context of our discussion,
00:42:49 it means we exercise faith in Jehovah’s promises.
00:42:54 When facing a trial,
00:42:56 we can search Jehovah’s Word for promises regarding the future,
00:43:01 and that gives us strength to keep on enduring.
00:43:03 For example, if we’re facing a serious illness,
00:43:07 God’s Word promises: “No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”
00:43:12 If we’re grieving the death of a loved one,
00:43:16 the Bible assures us there is going to be a resurrection.
00:43:20 The trial doesn’t disappear yet,
00:43:23 but exercising faith in Jehovah’s promises
00:43:26 helps us to endure.
00:43:29 Now, there’s something else that we can learn
00:43:30 from that dramatic illustration in the life of Jeremiah.
00:43:34 Back in Jeremiah 32, notice, please, verses 13 through 15.
00:43:40 Jeremiah was inspired to write, he said:
00:43:42 “I now commanded Baruch in their presence, saying:
00:43:46 “‘This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says,
00:43:51 “‘“Take these deeds, this deed of purchase,
00:43:53 “‘“the sealed one and the other deed left unsealed,
00:43:56 “‘“and put them into an earthenware vessel,
00:43:58 “‘so that they may be kept for a long time.”
00:44:01 “‘For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says,
00:44:06 “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”’”
00:44:12 Jeremiah involved Baruch in the legal proceedings
00:44:15 when he bought the field in Anathoth.
00:44:18 Jeremiah’s faith influenced Baruch for the good.
00:44:23 We can almost hear the confidence and conviction in his voice:
00:44:26 “This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel says.”
00:44:30 Jeremiah used that expression,
00:44:32 “Jehovah of armies,” more than any other Bible writer.
00:44:35 It was like Jeremiah said:
00:44:37 ‘Our God will certainly overturn the Babylonians.
00:44:39 ‘These promises are real; you can take them to the bank!
00:44:42 They’re not counterfeit; they’re completely true!’
00:44:47 What’s the lesson for us?
00:44:50 Our faith can strengthen fellow believers.
00:44:54 A sister named Joyce, while she herself was fighting cancer,
00:44:58 made what she called shot-in-the-arm cards.
00:45:02 They were collections of Bible verses,
00:45:05 pictures from our publications,
00:45:07 quotes from theocratic songs or Watchtower  articles,
00:45:10 and she would give them to those in need of encouragement.
00:45:13 One of her favorites was Psalm 112:7, 8.
00:45:18 And there it says: “He will not fear bad news.
00:45:22 “His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.
00:45:24 “His heart is unshakable; he is not afraid;
00:45:27 in the end he will look in triumph on his adversaries.”
00:45:32 Sister Joyce had a lot of bad news in her life,
00:45:36 but her faith in Jehovah’s promises was powerful.
00:45:41 Sadly, Joyce lost her fight with cancer a few years back,
00:45:45 but she “bought a field in Anathoth,”
00:45:48 and she will witness the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises.
00:45:53 Even now, she’s given us a shot in the arm
00:45:56 —encouragement from Jehovah’s Word—
00:45:58 and strengthened us with her faith.
00:46:00 And so, dear Gilead students, what have we learned?
00:46:04 Faith is like a “title-deed of things hoped for.”
00:46:07 Faith in Jehovah’s Word helps us to endure trials and adversity.
00:46:12 Our faith can have a powerful effect on those around us.
00:46:16 So when faced with persecution, “buy a field in Anathoth.”
00:46:20 When faced with a grievous health problem, “buy a field in Anathoth.”
00:46:24 When grieving the loss of a loved one, “buy a field in Anathoth.”
00:46:27 And some day soon, your faith will be rewarded.
00:46:31 You’ll walk in that field when Jehovah’s word comes true.
00:46:42 Well, what a beautiful talk!
00:46:45 Now to be honest (I don’t know if you are like me),
00:46:47 when I heard the theme “Buy a Field in Anathoth,”
00:46:51 I thought, ‘Where on earth is he going to take us?’
00:46:55 I mean, to be quite honest.
00:46:57 Well, Brother Fleegle, you took us to a very good spot
00:47:01 with the title deed and seeing the connection there.
00:47:04 And in fact, that’s going to be a little password.
00:47:06 We might say, “Buy a field in Anathoth.”
00:47:09 And if we say that to someone and they looked amazed,
00:47:12 we’ll say, “Oh, you weren’t there for the graduation program.”
00:47:18 Well, thank you very much.
00:47:20 Now, for you, dear students, over the last few months,
00:47:24 you’ve drawn very close to the instructors,
00:47:27 and you’ve heard them day in, day out.
00:47:31 You’ve learned and experienced a lot of things from them.
00:47:34 So the next two parts
00:47:36 are the opportunities for two of these instructors
00:47:38 to give you a few final words of encouragement.
00:47:42 So first of all, we’re going to have Brother Trent Lippold
00:47:46 who’s going to talk to you, and he has this interesting question:
00:47:49 “Distinguished—By What?”
00:47:55 He was a mighty man.
00:47:57 He felled the heroes of the enemy.
00:48:01 He slayed a giant. He even killed a lion.
00:48:04 And his name was not David.
00:48:08 Who was he?
00:48:09 Open your Bibles with me, please, to the book of 1 Chronicles chapter 11
00:48:15 —1 Chronicles 11:22:
00:48:21 “Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
00:48:23 “was a courageous man who performed
00:48:26 “many exploits in Kabzeel.
00:48:29 “He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab,
00:48:32 “and he descended into a waterpit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
00:48:38 “He also struck down an Egyptian man of extraordinary size
00:48:42 “—five cubits tall.
00:48:44 “Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand
00:48:47 “like the beam of loom workers,
00:48:50 “he went against him with a rod
00:48:52 “and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian’s hand
00:48:54 and killed him with his own spear.”
00:48:58 He is Benaiah.
00:49:02 Look at all we learn about him in these verses,
00:49:06 the qualities that Benaiah displayed.
00:49:10 It tells us in verse 22 that he “was a courageous man.”
00:49:14 He “performed many exploits in Kabzeel.”
00:49:17 Kabzeel—Kabzeel is a small place
00:49:21 on the very southern border of Judah.
00:49:24 It borders Edom in the middle of nowhere.
00:49:29 But Benaiah worked there.
00:49:31 He was happy to be there.
00:49:33 It may be that that was his home.
00:49:35 Or it may be that that was his assignment.
00:49:37 No matter, as obscure a place as Kabzeel is,
00:49:41 that’s where he worked.
00:49:44 And the record says that he performed
00:49:45 many exploits courageously in Kabzeel.
00:49:52 He killed a lion—courage.
00:49:55 But do you notice that “he descended into a waterpit . . .
00:49:59 and killed a lion”?
00:50:01 Courage.
00:50:03 He descended into a waterpit with a lion.
00:50:05 There’s only one coming out, and it was Benaiah.
00:50:09 “He descended into a waterpit on a snowy day.”
00:50:12 He didn’t wait for the sun to shine.
00:50:14 He knew that was the day —adverse conditions, no matter.
00:50:19 Benaiah went in, and he slayed the lion.
00:50:23 Look at verse 23, some more amazing qualities.
00:50:25 He struck down the giant, ‘an Egyptian of extraordinary size.’
00:50:29 But notice this: “Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand
00:50:32 “like the beam of loom workers, he [Benaiah]
00:50:35 went against him with a rod”—a rod, a stick.
00:50:39 He didn’t have the right equipment
00:50:41 —courage, adaptability, commitment.
00:50:46 And notice this. What does he do?
00:50:49 It says: “He went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away
00:50:53 from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.”
00:50:57 Courage, commitment, adaptability, resourcefulness
00:51:02 —these are admirable, beneficial qualities.
00:51:06 Are those the qualities that distinguished Benaiah?
00:51:11 Not entirely.
00:51:13 There was one quality that exceeded these,
00:51:17 and that quality was loyalty
00:51:21 —tenacious adherence to the person of Jehovah.
00:51:25 That’s what the Bible record reveals about Benaiah:
00:51:29 personal loyalty to Jehovah.
00:51:34 There is a caution, though, with loyalty.
00:51:38 The demarcation
00:51:40 between loyalty to Jehovah and loyalty to self
00:51:46 can often be blurry.
00:51:50 It hides under the inertia
00:51:54 of imperfection and selfishness.
00:51:58 That line of loyalty to Jehovah versus loyalty to self
00:52:03 can become very difficult to see.
00:52:05 In fact, loyalty to self can lie dormant within us
00:52:10 until the circumstances arise and change,
00:52:15 and then it can emerge.
00:52:17 And Benaiah and his contemporaries
00:52:20 provide for us a beautiful contrast
00:52:24 in loyalty to Jehovah and loyalty to self.
00:52:29 Think of Benaiah. He lived in a very tumultuous time.
00:52:33 David was a fugitive with his mighty men.
00:52:35 One of them likely was Benaiah, among others.
00:52:38 These men were comrades in arms running with David.
00:52:41 They were a band of brothers.
00:52:44 They were fiercely loyal to David
00:52:47 and, to be sure, they were loyal to Jehovah as well.
00:52:51 For example, among these three mighty men
00:52:53 were three brothers, fleshly brothers.
00:52:57 They’re mentioned in verses 20 and 26:
00:53:00 Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.
00:53:06 Now consider when circumstances changed for the mighty men,
00:53:11 when Saul died and David now became king,
00:53:16 in these changing circumstances,
00:53:20 what happened to the mighty men?
00:53:23 Here’s the contrast: Joab and Benaiah.
00:53:27 What happened to Joab?
00:53:30 Joab saw opportunity in changing circumstances,
00:53:35 and his loyalty to Jehovah was eclipsed
00:53:39 by his loyalty to himself.
00:53:43 For instance,
00:53:45 it was Joab who took matters into his own hands,
00:53:49 and he killed Abner
00:53:52 with whom David had already concluded a covenant.
00:53:56 He took matters into his own hands.
00:53:58 Why? He wanted Abner’s job.
00:54:02 His selfish ambitions got the better of him,
00:54:06 and they eclipsed his loyalty to Jehovah.
00:54:09 Joab was a courageous man.
00:54:11 He was resourceful.
00:54:12 He was adaptable.
00:54:14 Admirable qualities.
00:54:16 But in the absence of deep personal loyalty to Jehovah,
00:54:21 they seem somehow tainted, don’t they?
00:54:25 But consider Benaiah in the same circumstances.
00:54:28 Benaiah had no part in these kind of intrigues like Joab and his brothers.
00:54:33 Benaiah was loyal to Jehovah, and he was a loyal man
00:54:36 to Jehovah’s anointed one, David.
00:54:40 And look at what we find in verses 24 and 25,
00:54:44 verses 24 and 25: “These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did,
00:54:49 “and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors.
00:54:53 “Although he was distinguished even more than the thirty,
00:54:56 “he did not attain to the rank of the three.
00:55:01 However, David appointed him over his own bodyguard.”
00:55:08 You see, in the same circumstances as Joab,
00:55:13 Benaiah’s tenacious adherence to Jehovah
00:55:16 —his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah—
00:55:18 safeguarded him in these circumstances.
00:55:22 What did David see in Benaiah?
00:55:26 David saw in Benaiah what he himself exemplified,
00:55:30 and that was deep and strong personal loyalty to Jehovah.
00:55:35 You can see that in this verse, in verse 25, can’t you?
00:55:38 It says: “However, David appointed him over his own bodyguard.”
00:55:43 David knew that to assign someone
00:55:45 to this very, very trusted position
00:55:49 (head of his own bodyguard), the man in that position,
00:55:53 if he was loyal to Jehovah, would be loyal to him.
00:55:57 And that’s what David saw in Benaiah.
00:56:01 Then came another time of change decades later.
00:56:05 When David died and Solomon became king
00:56:09 —changed circumstances, another time of opportunity—
00:56:14 how would Benaiah react?
00:56:16 The same way he always did:
00:56:20 deep personal loyalty to Jehovah.
00:56:23 And it was Solomon when he became king
00:56:27 who rewarded Benaiah.
00:56:29 The son of David, Solomon, Jehovah’s anointed,
00:56:33 rewarded Benaiah for his loyalty.
00:56:36 Turn with me, please, to Proverbs 19:22.
00:56:40 You see, Solomon knew something about loyalty.
00:56:45 He was the son of David.
00:56:47 And look at what he wrote about loyalty at Proverbs 19:22.
00:56:52 Solomon said: “The desirable thing in a man
00:56:56 is his loyal love.”
00:56:58 His loyalty —that’s what Jehovah looks for in us.
00:57:05 So Benaiah was indeed a mighty man,
00:57:07 and he had beautiful qualities.
00:57:11 Did they distinguish him?
00:57:13 Not entirely.
00:57:15 It was his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah
00:57:19 first and foremost that distinguished him.
00:57:23 And because of that deep personal loyalty to Jehovah,
00:57:26 those qualities of Benaiah were beautiful.
00:57:31 So daily cultivate your loyalty to God
00:57:35 through prayer and study.
00:57:38 That’s been your training here.
00:57:41 Use your training to develop your close personal loyalty to Jehovah.
00:57:46 That’s what Benaiah did. Think of Benaiah’s training.
00:57:50 He was the son of Jehoiada.
00:57:52 Jehoiada was one of the chief Levitical priests in Israel.
00:57:58 Benaiah was raised with scrolls, not with swords.
00:58:01 Growing up as the son of a priest, that was his training.
00:58:07 So like Benaiah,
00:58:09 be willing to do the work without the rank.
00:58:14 Remember, loyalty is tested not when you are at ease.
00:58:18 Loyalty is tested under adversity.
00:58:21 So be careful in changing circumstances.
00:58:24 Guard your hearts.
00:58:28 Dear students, you all have beautiful qualities.
00:58:30 We’ve seen them over the last five months.
00:58:33 But may loyalty,
00:58:35 may your deep personal loyalty to Jehovah,
00:58:40 distinguish you.
00:58:49 Thank you very much, Brother Lippold, for that.
00:58:52 We all felt like we were students in the Gilead classroom, didn’t we?
00:58:56 And certainly you helped us to see the importance of loyalty.
00:59:00 Well, the next instructor, who’s also a helper to the Teaching Committee,
00:59:04 Brother Mark Noumair, is going to give this stirring encouragement
00:59:09 “March On With Jehovah!”
00:59:13 The young man received his assignment,
00:59:17 and it was not for the faint of heart.
00:59:20 He would have to tell about the desolation of cherished cities,
00:59:25 the burning of Jehovah’s temple, and the captivity of his people.
00:59:29 And for delivering these messages (which they were not easy),
00:59:34 he would endure
00:59:36 scathing and murderous attempts on his life.
00:59:42 Now, on top of that,
00:59:45 he would experience moments of discouragement,
00:59:48 isolation,
00:59:50 self-doubt.
00:59:53 When receiving his assignment, this young man said:
00:59:57 ‘Jehovah, I cannot do this.
00:59:59 I’m just a boy.’
01:00:02 The boy was from Anathoth,
01:00:08 and his name was Jeremiah.
01:00:11 But what would help him be successful with this assignment?
01:00:15 It would be following and taking to heart
01:00:19 the very points that Brother Fleegle brought out about faith.
01:00:23 He would need a deep, abiding faith and trust in Jehovah.
01:00:28 And in addition to that,
01:00:30 he would need to learn how to march.
01:00:35 Jeremiah was ready to enter the front lines of the battle
01:00:41 —the battle to defend pure worship against those who hate it.
01:00:46 And like any good soldier,
01:00:49 one of the first things you learn is how to march.
01:00:54 Now, marching is more challenging than mere walking.
01:00:58 Marching requires determination.
01:01:03 It requires stamina, endurance,
01:01:07 and to keep moving forward
01:01:10 in a regular, steady step.
01:01:13 And as Jeremiah entered this battle,
01:01:17 he would need to learn how to march.
01:01:22 What would help him?
01:01:24 Recalling what was written in God’s Word centuries before his time,
01:01:28 words recorded at Deuteronomy 31:6.
01:01:32 I want to read these words to you.
01:01:35 These words were so important to Jeremiah.
01:01:38 The context was when Moses was encouraging
01:01:42 confidence in Jehovah.
01:01:44 The nation of Israel was ready to enter into the Promised Land.
01:01:47 They would face enemies.
01:01:49 They would face a fight, a battle.
01:01:52 But look at what Moses says in verse 6 of Deuteronomy 31:
01:01:58 “Be courageous and strong.
01:02:00 “Do not be afraid or struck with terror before them,
01:02:04 “for Jehovah your God
01:02:06 “is the one marching with you.
01:02:10 “[He’s marching with you.]
01:02:11 He will neither desert you nor abandon you.”
01:02:17 So how did Jehovah march alongside this boy?
01:02:22 At Jeremiah 1:8, Jehovah tells Jeremiah:
01:02:27 “Do not be afraid because of their appearance,
01:02:31 for ‘I am with you to save you.’”
01:02:35 Don’t be afraid.
01:02:36 In other words, when a person marches with Jehovah,
01:02:41 you see, Jehovah marches with him,
01:02:45 boosting him along, making him strong.
01:02:47 It’s as if Jehovah told Jeremiah,
01:02:49 ‘Don’t worry, you just come and march with me.’
01:02:55 And for the next 67 years, that’s exactly what Jeremiah did
01:02:58 in Jehovah’s strength.
01:03:00 Think about what happened in Jehovah’s strength.
01:03:05 Jeremiah preached to hard-hearted people,
01:03:07 including wicked kings, corrupt priests, apostates.
01:03:10 He did it, and as he marched,
01:03:13 he saw Jehovah march with him.
01:03:15 He was conscious of that fact.
01:03:20 Jehovah saved him when imprisoned in a dungeon.
01:03:25 Jehovah supplied him a daily ration of food during a famine.
01:03:30 Jehovah rescued him from a cistern.
01:03:32 You see, this was real.
01:03:34 This was tangible. This was concrete.
01:03:37 It wasn’t made-up.
01:03:39 Jehovah was marching with him.
01:03:41 And as Jeremiah saw Jehovah’s support,
01:03:44 it strengthened him and it gave him more confidence,
01:03:47 and Jehovah marched with him.
01:03:49 And then Jeremiah was ready for the next trial.
01:03:55 Why do we bring this up?
01:03:57 Because your situation is very similar to Jeremiah’s.
01:04:02 How so?
01:04:03 Along with your Gilead training, you are being put on the front lines.
01:04:10 You’re going to be asked to defend pure worship,
01:04:12 maybe like you never have before.
01:04:16 So we want you to stay in the battle.
01:04:19 We want you to keep marching.
01:04:22 For example, what if in your assignment,
01:04:25 opposition turns into outright persecution?
01:04:30 Or what if in your branch territory,
01:04:33 you face political upheaval or war?
01:04:36 What if you need
01:04:39 to risk your lives
01:04:42 to provide relief
01:04:45 like our brothers in and around Ukraine are doing?
01:04:48 What if that happens?
01:04:51 Your brothers will be looking to you as an example.
01:04:55 Will you be able to set that example?
01:04:57 Can you maintain that example?
01:04:59 Yes, you can.
01:05:02 Because when you march with Jehovah
01:05:06 —now listen carefully
01:05:08 when you march with Jehovah,
01:05:11 he does something very special for you in moments of weakness.
01:05:17 Well, consider what happened to Jeremiah.
01:05:20 At one point, it got so bad that he wanted to quit.
01:05:23 ‘I’m quitting.’
01:05:24 Jeremiah 20:9:
01:05:26 ‘I’m not going to mention Jehovah’s name.
01:05:28 ‘I’m not going to talk about it anymore.
01:05:30 ‘I’m discouraged. I’m tired.
01:05:31 I’m exhausted. I’m going to stop marching.’
01:05:35 He was losing his focus.
01:05:39 So how does Jehovah help him? What did Jehovah do?
01:05:42 Did he say, ‘Well, Jeremiah, that’s it.
01:05:44 If you’re going to be exhausted, I’ll find another prophet.’
01:05:47 No, Jehovah did not do that.
01:05:50 What did Jehovah do?
01:05:52 And this is a thought we want you to take to heart,
01:05:54 Jeremiah 20:11.
01:06:00 How does Jehovah help him to keep marching?
01:06:04 “But Jehovah was with me
01:06:08 “[like a what, friend?
01:06:10 “like a brother? No, no, no.]
01:06:13 like a fearsome warrior.”
01:06:17 So in what way did Jehovah prove to be a fearsome warrior,
01:06:21 a mighty soldier, standing right at Jeremiah’s side?
01:06:26 How did Jehovah do that?
01:06:29 Well, what happens in battle?
01:06:32 When a soldier sees a fellow soldier stumble and fall,
01:06:35 what does he do?
01:06:36 He rushes to his side; he supports him;
01:06:39 he grabs him; they go together;
01:06:40 he wraps his arm around him, and they move to safety together.
01:06:43 This is what Jehovah did for Jeremiah.
01:06:48 In fact, Jeremiah tells us this
01:06:51 in chapter 20, and in verse 7.
01:06:53 What does Jeremiah say?
01:06:55 He experienced this.
01:06:57 He says:
01:06:59 “You used your strength against me,
01:07:03 and you prevailed.”
01:07:05 “You used your strength against me.”
01:07:07 What does that mean?
01:07:10 Jehovah used his strength against Jeremiah’s weakness.
01:07:15 Seeing Jehovah do this for him
01:07:18 time and again, time and again,
01:07:20 enabled Jeremiah to accomplish
01:07:22 what he could have never accomplished on his own.
01:07:26 This is the point we’re making for you.
01:07:28 All of these experiences strengthen and transform
01:07:32 his natural shyness,
01:07:34 his feelings of inadequacy,
01:07:36 and his lack of confidence
01:07:38 into ironlike boldness.
01:07:41 Jehovah was with him like a fearsome warrior.
01:07:44 Jehovah loved the commission he gave Jeremiah.
01:07:47 He was working with Jeremiah to fulfill this commission.
01:07:50 It was precious to Jehovah.
01:07:53 Just like your commission, it’s precious to Jehovah.
01:07:58 So you can be assured that Jehovah is going to do the same for you.
01:08:02 We want you to have that confidence.
01:08:05 In fact, one sister,
01:08:08 who not long ago graduated from Gilead,
01:08:11 experienced this firsthand.
01:08:16 Shortly after arriving in her assignment, she was arrested.
01:08:21 Our sister was held captive in a dungeonlike prison.
01:08:26 And during that time, she was given meager rations of food
01:08:29 and was subjected to painful, prolonged punishment.
01:08:33 How was she able to endure?
01:08:35 How could she stay strong?
01:08:37 How?
01:08:38 By marching with Jehovah.
01:08:41 And she never lost sight of the fact that she was part of an army of marchers.
01:08:45 She was marching with the fearsome Warrior.
01:08:48 In fact, this is what she said:
01:08:53 “Thinking about my Gilead classmates
01:08:56 “and visualizing their faces gave me power.
01:09:01 “I kept their smiling faces in front of me.
01:09:05 “I imagined where each classmate sat
01:09:08 “—each row from left to right— front to back.
01:09:12 “I recalled where they were from, what work they did in their assignments.
01:09:17 “This made the time go by quickly, and I felt no physical pain at all.
01:09:22 “I sang in my head Kingdom songs.
01:09:26 “The song I sang the most was ‘Jehovah Is Your Name.’
01:09:30 “Another song that touched my heart deeply
01:09:33 “was song number 38, ‘He Will Make You Strong.’
01:09:38 “I made that song more personal
01:09:41 “by replacing the pronoun ‘you’ with ‘me.’
01:09:45 “This song helped me never to give up.
01:09:50 “I had no Bible.
01:09:52 “So each day, I meditated on Bible teachings
01:09:55 “such as everlasting life in Paradise and a resurrection hope.
01:09:59 “These meditations gave me deep inner joy
01:10:02 “and a calm that cannot be described.
01:10:07 “At times, I thought about the possibility of facing death,
01:10:11 but the fear of death did not consume me.”
01:10:17 Yes, she thought about the possibility of facing death,
01:10:20 but the fear of death did not consume her.
01:10:26 The fearsome Warrior, Jehovah, was marching with her.
01:10:30 No prison walls, no bars can block Jehovah from marching with her.
01:10:34 And our sister was recently released from prison.
01:10:42 So whatever your trials,
01:10:44 we don’t know what trials you’re going to face.
01:10:46 You don’t know. We don’t know.
01:10:49 But reflect on how Jehovah supports you.
01:10:52 Stay in the battle.
01:10:54 And when you reflect on how Jehovah supports you,
01:10:56 it’s tangible, it’s real, it’s concrete.
01:10:59 Think about that.
01:11:00 Jehovah will never stop marching with you.
01:11:03 And remember, you are part of a large army.
01:11:07 You’re not alone.
01:11:10 Therefore, when you see a fellow worshipper struggling,
01:11:14 don’t ignore them.
01:11:16 Help them not to fall behind.
01:11:18 Help them.
01:11:19 Help them.
01:11:21 You’re part of an army.
01:11:23 You’ve been trained to do this.
01:11:25 That’s what school taught you:
01:11:27 not to be independent, but to be interdependent,
01:11:30 not independen—interdependent with your brothers and sisters.
01:11:35 That’s your job.
01:11:37 Be quick to help them back up.
01:11:39 Keep marching with Jehovah.
01:11:42 And although you don’t know what challenges lie ahead,
01:11:47 you are prepared.
01:11:50 So with your marching orders in hand,
01:11:54 be courageous and strong,
01:11:56 knowing that each trial you face, each trial you endure,
01:12:00 will make you stronger for the next one.
01:12:04 Be confident that you will always have the fearsome Warrior,
01:12:08 the mighty Soldier marching by your side.
01:12:11 He’s there, Jehovah.
01:12:15 So now go
01:12:17 wherever the battle may take you.
01:12:20 Go,
01:12:22 and be determined to fulfill your commission
01:12:24 to support your brothers
01:12:27 as you march on with Jehovah.
01:12:40 What a powerful encouragement
01:12:42 —one that I’m sure you’ll remember for many years to come!
01:12:47 And students, maybe I need to apologize.
01:12:49 I didn’t realize Anathoth was going to be the buzz word.
01:12:53 You see, if I had realized that in the beginning in my introduction,
01:12:57 I would have said, “We need to follow the example of Jesus,
01:13:00 “who according to Matthew 16:14
01:13:02 people thought was Jeremiah, who was from Anathoth.”
01:13:06 But anyway, you can take note of that.
01:13:11 But thank you again, Brother Noumair.
01:13:12 That was a very encouraging and stimulating talk.
01:13:17 Although these talks were directed to the Gilead graduates,
01:13:20 they contain beneficial lessons for all of us.
01:13:23 We hope you enjoyed Part 1.
01:13:25 Parts 2 and 3 will be available on jw.org later this month.
01:13:31 Our postcard is from the United States.
01:13:34 It’s a large territory encompassing a variety of landscapes.
01:13:39 There are majestic mountains,
01:13:41 twisting ravines,
01:13:43 tropical islands,
01:13:45 and vast deserts.
01:13:48 Across this varied land resides an even greater diversity of people.
01:13:55 To help all they can,
01:13:57 over 1.2 million publishers preach in 114 languages!
01:14:02 Whether native speakers or learners of a new language,
01:14:05 publishers try to reach the heart.
01:14:09 One of the largest language groups in the United States is Haitian Creole.
01:14:13 There are approximately one million people of Haitian descent in the branch territory
01:14:18 with over 10,000 publishers.
01:14:21 Haitians are a vibrant people as expressed
01:14:24 in their energetic dances, their colorful clothing,
01:14:27 and their delicious food.
01:14:30 Just north of Miami, Florida,
01:14:32 there’s a community referred to as “Little Haiti.”
01:14:36 It’s here where the 80 publishers of the West Haitian Creole Congregation
01:14:40 search for lovers of truth.
01:14:43 They have witnessed in parks and on street corners.
01:14:46 They have written letters and focused
01:14:48 on the family members of their Bible students.
01:14:51 The congregation now
01:14:52 conducts on average 126 Bible studies!
01:14:56 With love, the brothers and sisters
01:14:59 of the West Haitian Creole Congregation of Miami, Florida,
01:15:02 send their greetings to the worldwide brotherhood!
01:15:07 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:15:10 this is JW Broadcasting!
