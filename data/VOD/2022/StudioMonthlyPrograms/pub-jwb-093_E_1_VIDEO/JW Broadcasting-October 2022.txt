00:00:02 It’s a pleasure to welcome you to JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:06 What can we look forward to in this month’s program?
00:00:10 In the series “Iron Sharpens Iron,”
00:00:12 we’ll join an experienced circuit overseer for some field-tested suggestions
00:00:17 on how we can use questions
00:00:19 to start and continue good conversations in the ministry.
00:00:23 Day after day, our young people are tested
00:00:26 to compromise their integrity.
00:00:28 We’ll meet Cory and Kamryn,
00:00:30 two young people who talk frankly about the pressure
00:00:33 they faced in high school to have sex.
00:00:35 How did they resist temptation
00:00:38 and stand their ground?
00:00:40 Do you find the idea of conducting a Bible study intimidating?
00:00:44 In a new dramatization,
00:00:46 Jade conducts her first Bible study
00:00:48 and learns what it takes to be an effective teacher.
00:00:52 This is the October 2022 edition of JW Broadcasting.
00:01:16 For over 100 years,
00:01:17 Jehovah’s organization
00:01:19 has been producing books
00:01:20 to help us teach people Bible truths.
00:01:23 Do you remember when some of these study books were released?
00:01:27 “This Means Everlasting Life”
00:01:29 was released in 1950;
00:01:32 The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,
00:01:34 in 1968;
00:01:36 You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,
00:01:38 in 1982;
00:01:40 and Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life,
00:01:43 in 1995.
00:01:46 What did those titles have in common?
00:01:49 They showed that it’s possible for a person to learn
00:01:52 what Jehovah requires to live forever.
00:01:55 And that’s why we keep searching for people
00:01:57 who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life”
00:02:00 and who are willing to study the Bible with us.
00:02:03 All of those books and several more that we published since then
00:02:07 have been instrumental in helping people
00:02:09 become believers in our wonderful hope for the future.
00:02:13 In 2021, we added one more book to the list, entitled
00:02:18 Enjoy Life Forever!
00:02:20 —An Interactive Bible Course.
00:02:23 This title adds another element:
00:02:25 that it’s possible not only to gain everlasting life
00:02:28 but also to learn how to enjoy life even now.
00:02:33 The title is taken from Psalm 22:26, which says:
00:02:38 “Those seeking Jehovah will praise him.
00:02:42 May you enjoy life forever.”
00:02:45 This newest study publication is very different
00:02:47 from all the others that we’ve produced.
00:02:50 In this broadcast, we want to explain
00:02:53 what went on behind the scenes
00:02:55 to produce Enjoy Life Forever!
00:02:58 Under the direction of the Governing Body,
00:03:00 hundreds of Bethelites around the world
00:03:02 worked very hard to make it possible
00:03:04 for us to have this innovative study tool.
00:03:07 However, they’ll be quick to say that all credit for this goes to Jehovah.
00:03:12 That’s why we can say
00:03:14 just as the prophet Isaiah said in ancient times of our great God:
00:03:19 “O Jehovah, . . .
00:03:21 everything we have done you have accomplished for us.”
00:03:25 We know that any success we enjoy
00:03:28 is because of Jehovah’s direction and blessing.
00:03:30 And so the theme of this presentation is
00:03:34 “See What Jehovah Has Done for Us!”
00:03:38 “The faithful and discreet slave” has always taken very seriously
00:03:42 Jesus’ command recorded at Matthew 28:19:
00:03:45 “Go, . . . and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them.”
00:03:50 And that’s what our Bible study activity aims to accomplish.
00:03:55 For decades, our method of conducting studies
00:03:57 was to study printed material paragraph by paragraph.
00:04:02 When answering the questions for the paragraphs,
00:04:04 some students would often just repeat what was stated in the book.
00:04:08 However, it was hard to know whether the truth
00:04:10 was really touching their heart.
00:04:12 With Enjoy Life Forever! we’re using a different method of teaching
00:04:16 that generates candid expressions by the students in their own words.
00:04:20 This is just what the Governing Body feels is needed
00:04:24 to bring new ones to dedication and baptism
00:04:26 during these urgent last days.
00:04:29 If you’ve begun conducting Bible studies with Enjoy Life Forever!,
00:04:33 you can appreciate how it’s adjusting our Bible study work.
00:04:37 Here’s what some longtime pioneers have said
00:04:40 after covering just one lesson on their studies:
00:04:44 “This was the most beautiful spiritual conversation
00:04:47 I have ever had with a student!”
00:04:50 “My student revealed things she had never told me before.
00:04:54 I felt as if I was hearing her heart for the first time!”
00:04:59 “It truly reaches the heart and motivates students to action.”
00:05:04 And one brother wrote: “I am so excited about this new Bible course
00:05:08 “that I am begging Jehovah to hear my prayers
00:05:11 to be able to conduct progressive studies.”
00:05:16 It was early in 2019 when the Writing Committee
00:05:19 took on the amazing project to produce a new Bible study tool.
00:05:23 They assembled a team of writers, designers, and consultants
00:05:26 to investigate whether we could improve the publications that we were then using.
00:05:32 At the very first discussion session,
00:05:34 everyone was encouraged to pray often about the task at hand
00:05:38 —to pray when thinking about it, when brainstorming with others,
00:05:42 and when working on it—
00:05:44 and to respond to the influence of holy spirit.
00:05:48 Why pray so much?
00:05:50 Proverbs 16:3 gives the answer:
00:05:55 “Commit to Jehovah whatever you do,
00:05:58 and your plans will succeed.”
00:06:01 The team was also encouraged to think outside the box,
00:06:05 which means to think outside, or beyond,
00:06:07 the way things have always been done in the past.
00:06:10 Times have changed, people have changed,
00:06:13 and the way that many prefer to be taught has changed.
00:06:17 These days they respond better to multimedia
00:06:20 that engages them and holds their attention.
00:06:23 The team was shown a puzzle
00:06:25 that illustrates what it means to think outside the box
00:06:29 —the nine-dots puzzle.
00:06:31 The challenge is to connect all nine dots
00:06:34 with just four straight lines.
00:06:36 Here are a few examples
00:06:37 of how some will try to solve the puzzle.
00:06:39 Notice that with each attempt
00:06:41 one dot is missed.
00:06:43 The problem is that our mind tends
00:06:45 to build a box around the dots,
00:06:47 and that instantly limits
00:06:49 what we can imagine.
00:06:50 The only way to connect all nine dots
00:06:53 with just four straight lines
00:06:55 is by going outside the box
00:06:57 and thinking differently
00:06:59 than we normally would.
00:07:03 The point was to show that novel, creative thinking
00:07:06 was needed to imagine something
00:07:08 other than the traditional way of studying the Bible with people.
00:07:12 With Jehovah’s spirit guiding fresh thinking,
00:07:14 it would be interesting to see what innovative ideas could be thought of
00:07:18 for how to teach the truth to Bible students.
00:07:21 And yet, it was felt that our brothers and sisters
00:07:23 would need to see some familiar features in the new publication.
00:07:28 That’s why the first part of each lesson
00:07:30 is designed similar to the Good News  brochure.
00:07:32 It features numbered questions,
00:07:35 each followed by a paragraph
00:07:37 that briefly covers fundamental facts
00:07:38 about the topic.
00:07:40 Next, the “Dig Deeper” section
00:07:42 reasons on the topic,
00:07:44 shows how to apply what’s learned,
00:07:46 and discusses what the topic teaches us
00:07:48 about Jehovah.
00:07:50 It includes features found
00:07:51 in the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook
00:07:53 —bulleted discussion points,
00:07:55 scriptures to read,
00:07:57 videos to play,
00:07:58 and viewpoint questions to answer.
00:08:01 And like the study articles in The Watchtower,
00:08:03 the last part of each lesson includes just three review questions.
00:08:08 It was decided that we could cover much less printed material
00:08:11 and let the Bible do the teaching
00:08:14 and that we need to draw out the student’s feelings
00:08:17 with well-worded viewpoint questions
00:08:19 and include videos and generous artwork.
00:08:23 We must help the student
00:08:24 to see Jehovah as a real Person
00:08:27 and to develop a warm relationship with him
00:08:30 and encourage the student to get into a routine
00:08:32 of regular Bible reading, prayer, and meeting attendance.
00:08:36 Does Enjoy Life Forever!  provide what we need to accomplish all of that?
00:08:41 It certainly does!
00:08:43 The scriptures are the focal point of each lesson,
00:08:47 so the student is prompted to find answers in the Bible.
00:08:51 The questions draw out the student’s feelings about what he’s learning.
00:08:55 Early in the course, students are helped
00:08:57 to appreciate what Jehovah is like,
00:09:00 to feel his love for them,
00:09:03 and to see how to draw close to him as their Friend.
00:09:06 The beautiful artwork and motivating videos have real emotional impact.
00:09:13 This project to produce Enjoy Life Forever!
00:09:16 required the collaboration of six departments at world headquarters.
00:09:20 As directed by the Governing Body,
00:09:22 the Writing Department researched, wrote,
00:09:25 and proofread the text for each lesson.
00:09:28 These were then sent to hundreds of brothers and sisters around the world
00:09:31 to test them on their Bible studies.
00:09:35 The Writing Department coordinated the work with other departments
00:09:38 to keep the project on schedule.
00:09:41 Translation Services helped to simplify
00:09:44 the vocabulary and logic of what was written.
00:09:47 They identified any English text
00:09:49 that would be a problem for translators to render in their local languages.
00:09:54 As of right now, Enjoy Life Forever!
00:09:56 has been approved in upward of 700 languages.
00:10:01 The Art Department designed
00:10:03 the book’s layout and artwork.
00:10:05 Teams in several branches photographed models
00:10:07 to help the illustrators
00:10:09 create the many beautiful scenes
00:10:11 that appear in the book,
00:10:12 which contains over 600 images.
00:10:15 MEPS Programming developed new tools
00:10:18 so that the digital version of the book in the JW Library®  app
00:10:21 would look similar to the printed edition.
00:10:24 This was the first publication
00:10:26 for which both print and digital formats
00:10:29 were designed simultaneously.
00:10:32 Text Processing Services composed the text and artwork
00:10:35 for both the print and digital formats,
00:10:37 transcribed the book into English braille,
00:10:40 and instructed the branches
00:10:41 on how to produce the book
00:10:43 in their languages.
00:10:44 Audio/Video Services produced several new videos and excerpts
00:10:48 of many existing videos from the jw.org website.
00:10:53 They also produced unique audio recordings of the book
00:10:56 that include various voices and sounds.
00:11:00 This was truly a collaborative effort!
00:11:02 But there was a major problem
00:11:04 that could have stalled this project:
00:11:06 COVID-19.
00:11:09 When world headquarters and the branches were locked down,
00:11:12 60 percent of the project still needed to be completed.
00:11:16 And yet, the Governing Body had given it high priority.
00:11:21 The following video will give you some idea
00:11:23 of how the departments  worked together to get their work done
00:11:27 despite the challenges they faced during the pandemic.
00:11:31 Everything about Enjoy Life Forever!
00:11:33 is different from any other publication
00:11:35 we’ve produced in the past.
00:11:36 And from the start of the project,
00:11:37 two things were critical:
00:11:39 good communication and good documentation.
00:11:41 But honestly, time and again,
00:11:43 the thing that proved to be the most important
00:11:45 was reliance on Jehovah.
00:11:46 The Writing Committee’s goal was to create
00:11:48 a first-class digital experience
00:11:51 that would engage Bible students.
00:11:53 The digital design system had to be completely remodeled
00:11:57 so that Enjoy Life Forever!  would look uniform
00:11:59 whether it’s viewed in JW Library®,
00:12:01 on jw.org, or in print.
00:12:03 Right from the inception of this project,
00:12:06 the brothers looked for input
00:12:07 so that the study material would be
00:12:09 easily available in as many languages as possible.
00:12:12 And for that reason, a team from Translation Services
00:12:15 worked along with the writers.
00:12:17 A publication of this size would usually take
00:12:20 about two or three years to complete,
00:12:22 but the Writing Committee
00:12:23 was really interested in getting the Enjoy Life Forever!  book
00:12:25 out there as soon as possible.
00:12:27 The Enjoy Life Forever!  book
00:12:29 required an intense amount of collaboration.
00:12:31 Right from the beginning,
00:12:32 the Writing Committee
00:12:33 got all six departments together
00:12:35 so we could work unitedly through the production.
00:13:11 Our existing tool set didn’t have the ability
00:13:13 to style digital publications like we can with print.
00:13:16 We could do black text on a white background with gray boxes.
00:13:21 That was the extent of the functionality that we had available.
00:13:25 Enjoy Life Forever!  is very interactive for the student.
00:13:28 When producing the audio for this publication,
00:13:30 we endeavored to maintain that feel.
00:13:33 So we added multiple voices, musical cues
00:13:36 and, in some cases, the audio track for the video
00:13:39 was reedited to teach the point effectively.
00:13:42 When we got to Lesson 32,
00:13:44 we felt that it might be too complicated
00:13:46 to build as a digital experience,
00:13:48 but that’s when the collaboration really paid off.
00:13:51 It took every tool that we had
00:13:53 and basically every trick in order to build
00:13:56 the digital version of that lesson.
00:13:58 As we were working on the prototype,
00:14:00 we would collaborate with the User Experience Group
00:14:02 to make sure that the look and feel of the digital edition
00:14:04 was the same whether it was on a large device
00:14:07 or a small device.
00:14:09 The entire chart is a visual aid.
00:14:11 So we wanted to be sure that all of our users,
00:14:13 especially those who are visually impaired,
00:14:15 would be able to understand the teaching point.
00:14:18 This required us to build the chart
00:14:20 so that screen readers could read the text
00:14:23 and that each picture would have a description for those who needed it.
00:14:27 Early in the concept stage, we understood that there would be
00:14:30 about 200 videos in this publication,
00:14:32 requiring thousands of hours of work:
00:14:34 eight brand new videos
00:14:36 and of the remaining videos, around 60 would need to be edited.
00:14:39 Just as eight new videos were entering their production phase,
00:14:43 COVID-19 hit, effectively halting
00:14:45 video production around the world.
00:14:47 This work stoppage continued until each branch could determine
00:14:51 how they could film safely
00:14:53 and still meet the deadline only nine months away.
00:14:56 Because of the pandemic, photo sessions here at headquarters
00:14:59 were completely stopped for four months.
00:15:01 Now, as things progressed, we were able to resume photography,
00:15:04 only by adhering to strict protocols.
00:15:08 For example, we had a family photograph themselves
00:15:10 while being directed by the Art Department here.
00:15:13 So everything that a Bible study conductor had been trained to do
00:15:16 —ask all the important questions,
00:15:18 develop love for Jehovah in their Bible students, show videos—
00:15:21 it’s all built into the publication.
00:15:23 So would the concept work with actual Bible students?
00:15:26 To find out, we did in-house testing.
00:15:29 And then at the same time,
00:15:30 we sent out the lessons around the world to publishers, pioneers,
00:15:34 missionaries, and circuit overseers.
00:15:36 And they used the lessons with actual Bible students.
00:15:38 We tested every lesson of the book this way.
00:15:41 And then the responses that we got back were analyzed,
00:15:43 and we made further refinements.
00:15:45 We had hundreds of team meetings, and we felt Jehovah’s holy spirit
00:15:49 equipping all of us after we opened a meeting with prayer.
00:15:52 When you collaborate, you get a better product.
00:15:55 It’s more direct, simpler, and easier to understand.
00:15:59 Also, thinking ahead
00:16:00 about potential translation problems and addressing them
00:16:03 helped expedite translation in hundreds of languages.
00:16:21 I feel that Jehovah helped us
00:16:23 accomplish this job in a shorter amount of time
00:16:26 and a quality that would have been very difficult
00:16:28 even under normal circumstances.
00:16:30 How amazing Jehovah is!
00:16:33 With the Governing Body wholeheartedly embracing the project
00:16:37 and everyone on the production team willingly giving their all,
00:16:41 we could see clear evidence of Jehovah’s backing.
00:16:45 Now that we’ve seen what Jehovah has wonderfully done for us,
00:16:49 what must we do for him?
00:16:52 Remember, Jesus’ command at Matthew 28:19, 20
00:16:55 applies to all Christians.
00:16:58 Regarding that command, note what the article
00:17:00 “Keep Busy During the Last of ‘the Last Days’” states
00:17:03 in the October 2019 issue of The Watchtower:
00:17:08 “As we conduct Bible studies,
00:17:10 “we have to try our best to ‘make disciples . . . ,
00:17:13 “teaching them to observe all the things [Jesus has] commanded.’
00:17:18 “We need to help people understand how important it is
00:17:21 “for them to take their stand for Jehovah and his Kingdom.
00:17:24 “This means trying to motivate people to make the truth their own
00:17:28 “by applying what they learn, dedicating their life to Jehovah,
00:17:33 “and getting baptized.
00:17:35 Only then will they survive Jehovah’s day.”
00:17:39 In most parts of the earth,
00:17:40 people are not waiting in line for Bible studies.
00:17:43 So we have to be proactive, trying our best to find people
00:17:47 with whom we can start and conduct progressive studies,
00:17:50 using our interactive Bible course.
00:17:53 We want as many righthearted persons as possible
00:17:56 to become Jehovah’s willing, loyal Witnesses.
00:18:00 Here are seven suggestions you can write down now and try later.
00:18:04 They really work!
00:18:06 The first and most important is:
00:18:09 Pray for a Bible study.
00:18:11 Never underestimate the power of prayer,
00:18:14 so be specific in your prayers and keep praying for studies.
00:18:19 Work in harmony with your prayers by offering studies at every opportunity,
00:18:24 including to your relatives and acquaintances.
00:18:27 (2) Show people the brochure.
00:18:31 Use the intriguing question on the back cover to pique their interest.
00:18:36 It asks: “Is it possible to enjoy life forever?”
00:18:41 Offer to cover the three introductory lessons in the brochure.
00:18:44 After that, the person can decide
00:18:46 whether to continue
00:18:48 with the rest of the Bible course in the book.
00:18:51 (3) Try the direct approach.
00:18:54 Introduce yourself as a Bible teacher,
00:18:57 and come right out and ask people
00:18:59 whether they would like to learn more about the Bible.
00:19:02 Explain that we have a most enjoyable and easy interactive Bible course
00:19:06 and that you have openings in your teaching schedule.
00:19:10 (4) Ask your studies for referrals.
00:19:15 You can do this while studying the first paragraph of lesson 01.
00:19:18 It asks: “Do you think that the Bible can help anyone you know?”
00:19:23 If your student mentions a friend, a relative, a neighbor, or a workmate,
00:19:28 offer to demonstrate the course to that person.
00:19:32 (5) Approach meeting attenders.
00:19:35 Don’t assume that interested ones you see at congregation meetings
00:19:40 are already studying.
00:19:41 Ask them, and if they are not currently studying,
00:19:44 offer to get them started.
00:19:47 (6) Ask non-Witness marriage mates.
00:19:52 When was the last time they were offered a Bible study?
00:19:56 Even if they had declined an offer in the past,
00:19:58 they might be interested now.
00:20:00 And they may prefer to study with someone outside their family.
00:20:05 And (7) talk to those who’ve studied before.
00:20:09 Did you study with someone years ago in one of our other publications
00:20:13 who did not make any progress?
00:20:15 Why not contact them,
00:20:17 explain that we have a new interactive Bible course,
00:20:20 and ask if they’d like to study again?
00:20:23 This may be just what they need now to act on what they learn.
00:20:30 A key principle that applies to the efforts
00:20:32 we put forth in the Bible study work
00:20:34 is found at Galatians 6:9, which says:
00:20:38 “So let us not give up in doing what is fine,
00:20:42 “for in due time we will reap
00:20:44 if we do not tire out.”
00:20:47 So may we never lose our enthusiasm in making disciples
00:20:50 nor relax our efforts.
00:20:53 With Jehovah’s rich blessing on our Bible study activity
00:20:56 using Enjoy Life Forever!
00:20:59 we’ll be able to say thankfully:
00:21:01 “O Jehovah, . . . everything we have done
00:21:04 you have accomplished for us”!
00:21:09 One way we’ve been trained to become better disciple-makers
00:21:12 is through the videos.
00:21:15 Do you remember when we first met Neeta and Jade
00:21:18 during the 2020 “Always Rejoice”! Convention?
00:21:22 That series provided so many valuable lessons
00:21:25 about what it takes to be an effective teacher.
00:21:28 This month we have another new dramatization.
00:21:31 And in this episode, the story has come full circle,
00:21:35 with Jade now conducting her first Bible study
00:21:38 using Enjoy Life Forever!
00:22:10 Stop the ball!
00:22:14 So, what’s your biggest question about life?
00:22:16 Why are people so obsessed with kicking round objects?
00:22:22 Well, there’s that.
00:22:23 But seriously, anything?
00:22:31 Why do people hate?
00:22:33 If we’re all God’s children, what’s the deal?
00:22:36 Good question and one the Bible definitely answers, um.
00:22:41 But you’ve a train to catch.
00:22:43 So we’ll stop there.
00:22:45 But, um, is Tuesday still good?
00:22:50 Assuming space-time hasn’t collapsed into a singularity,
00:22:53 I’m open.
00:22:56 OK, cool.
00:23:00 So, um, on Tuesday, we’ll carry on with,
00:23:04 um, that chapter, this section here . . .
00:23:07 Hey.
00:23:08 Hi.
00:23:23 So?
00:23:26 How’s the study going?
00:23:28 Brilliant!
00:23:29 We’re zipping right through the easy stuff.
00:23:35 So, what I love about this prophecy
00:23:37 is that it was written, like, 200 years before it actually happened,
00:23:40 and every single detail came true.
00:23:44 The men in charge just left the gates open.
00:23:49 I mean, I would have fired anyone that got drunk
00:23:52 and left the city gates open.
00:23:57 Anyway, back to the prophecy . . .
00:24:00 So “God is love,” but he’s going to kill billions.
00:24:03 How does that work?
00:24:04 Well, it’ll make sense later.
00:24:06 But for now,
00:24:07 let’s just focus on what I was talking about earlier.
00:24:10 What’s so nice about this chapter is that it’s talking about prayer.
00:24:12 Well, it’s talking about how Jehovah helps us with prayer,
00:24:16 and so it’s really lovely because we can pray to someone that’s created . . .
00:24:20 Basically, all of this is evidence of “the last days.”
00:24:26 So, what would you say are the signs of the last days?
00:24:33 Wars,
00:24:35 disasters,
00:24:38 rude people, mm, yeah.
00:24:43 Anything else?
00:24:46 No.
00:24:48 OK, that’s fine.
00:24:51 We can just, um— We’ll just review it in the next lesson.
00:24:54 It’s fine.
00:24:55 Do you want to just wrap it up now then?
00:24:57 Yeah.
00:25:02 Is everything OK?
00:25:06 Blissful.
00:25:08 I’m going to go.
00:25:10 All right. Bye, Gladys.
00:25:23 And she just said one word, I just—
00:25:25 I don’t know what to do.
00:25:29 Wow! Thankfully I’ve never had a student like that.
00:25:33 OK, she’s really getting a hang of this irony thing, isn’t she?
00:25:38 But seriously, I—
00:25:41 I really put myself into the study to try and make it live.
00:25:45 And I get “Yes,”
00:25:48 “No,”
00:25:49 “Maybe,”
00:25:50 or another insufferable, off-topic question.
00:25:56 Maybe let’s do a bit of research?
00:25:59 I knew you’d say that.
00:26:02 I’ll put the kettle on.
00:26:04 Thanks, Keesha.
00:26:06 Here we go
00:26:07 —October 2020 Watchtower— this box.
00:26:16 “Exercise self-control by not talking too much.”
00:26:25 I guess I do need help.
00:26:27 But look:
00:26:28 “Let the student see that you’re excited about Bible truths.”
00:26:31 Spot-on there!
00:26:34 “Make friends in the congregation.”
00:26:39 Oh, I could, or maybe we could, do this.
00:26:43 “Look for signs that reveal [her] desire to serve Jehovah.”
00:26:49 Who’s free on Friday?
00:26:51 Sorry, Jade. I’m busy.
00:26:53 Oh.
00:26:55 Yeah. I’d love to.
00:26:58 OK.
00:27:05 Uh, Jade, Jade, my tablet?
00:27:09 No? Gone. OK.
00:27:18 Hey.
00:27:21 Hey.
00:27:23 So a surprise today:
00:27:24 My usual lecture has been canceled in favor of a discussion, and . . .
00:27:31 Jade, I’m not really the drumroll type.
00:27:33 Oh, hey.
00:27:34 Hi.
00:27:35 I’m Neeta, one of Jade’s roommates.
00:27:38 And you’re?
00:27:39 Gladys.
00:27:42 So let’s start with the question you hit me with last time,
00:27:46 which is, Why do we stay neutral when we see injustice?
00:27:51 I take it you’ve had your fair share?
00:27:55 Uh-huh.
00:27:56 Me too,
00:27:57 although not as bad as my mum and dad from what they tell me.
00:28:01 But how will things ever change if we don’t do something about it?
00:28:06 Let’s see what the Bible has to say
00:28:08 at Jeremiah 10:23.
00:28:13 Could you read that?
00:28:15 “I well know, O Jehovah,
00:28:17 “that man’s way does not belong to him.
00:28:21 “It does not belong to man who is walking
00:28:22 even to direct his step.”
00:28:26 But if that’s true, then the future of the human race
00:28:29 is looking quite bleak.
00:28:32 Does that mean then
00:28:33 that there’s no hope for us and there’s no point in carrying on?
00:28:36 What’s the point?
00:28:39 Hmm. Good question.
00:28:40 Very good question.
00:28:44 Jade was excited to conduct a study,
00:28:47 but she learned that making disciples takes more than just enthusiasm.
00:28:51 It also requires the patience and the self-control
00:28:54 to talk less and listen more.
00:28:57 Neeta helped Jade improve her teaching by doing a little research
00:29:01 in the October 2020 issue of The Watchtower,
00:29:04 which featured two study articles
00:29:07 on conducting Bible studies.
00:29:09 Earlier that same year,
00:29:10 the January issue featured
00:29:12 another study article entitled
00:29:14 “Go, Therefore, and Make Disciples.”
00:29:18 That article was filled with suggestions
00:29:19 on how to help our students draw closer to Jehovah.
00:29:23 Listen to the impact those suggestions have had on three regular pioneers
00:29:28 in our next video from the series Lessons From The Watchtower.
00:29:47 Our goal as teachers
00:29:49 is to help the person to become a disciple of Christ.
00:29:55 I want my student
00:29:56 to love Jehovah
00:29:57 the same way that I do.
00:29:59 What I most enjoy
00:30:00 is conducting Bible studies.
00:30:02 Being able to see
00:30:03 a student grow spiritually
00:30:05 is a joy that can’t be put into words.
00:30:08 The Watchtower  of January 2020
00:30:10 mentions several things that we need to keep in mind
00:30:13 as we conduct a study.
00:30:16 Studying the article,
00:30:18 I saw how many changes I needed to make when I conduct a Bible study.
00:30:22 It highlighted that besides helping the student to gain knowledge,
00:30:25 it’s even more important that we help them progress
00:30:28 to the point of dedicating their lives to Jehovah
00:30:31 and, of course, getting baptized.
00:30:33 Even though I read about how we should stop studying
00:30:35 with nonprogressive Bible studies,
00:30:38 I didn’t feel comfortable doing it
00:30:40 because I was afraid I might make the wrong decision.
00:30:43 Although I was pretty sure
00:30:45 that my Bible student wasn’t yet married
00:30:48 (that is legally married,
00:30:50 she had never told me this directly),
00:30:54 I just didn’t feel comfortable talking with her about it.
00:30:58 I had a Bible student who always prepared for
00:31:01 and commented well at the study.
00:31:02 I kept inviting her to the meetings,
00:31:04 but she never went to a single one,
00:31:07 and she never attended the Memorial.
00:31:10 I saw that she still had ties with some aspects of her religion.
00:31:17 The article brought out that in the first few weeks,
00:31:20 as soon as the study becomes regular,
00:31:22 it’s important to start praying with the student.
00:31:24 It used to take me a long time to start doing that.
00:31:29 The article helped me
00:31:30 because it encouraged me
00:31:31 to bring others with me on the study
00:31:34 and also not to be afraid
00:31:37 to bring along those who are more experienced.
00:31:40 In the article, it brought out how important it is
00:31:43 not just for us to pray with our students
00:31:45 but also to help them
00:31:47 to begin saying their own prayers as well.
00:31:51 After that, when the study became regular,
00:31:54 I’d pray before and after each session.
00:31:57 And I encouraged each of them
00:31:59 to also begin praying to Jehovah personally.
00:32:03 So praying became a daily habit for them.
00:32:06 A circuit overseer’s wife went with me on my study,
00:32:09 and she asked my student if she was married.
00:32:12 “Yes, I’m married.”
00:32:14 “But are you legally married?”
00:32:17 And then she responded, “No.”
00:32:20 So that really opened up an opportunity
00:32:23 for me to help the student out with this situation.
00:32:27 The article gave some suggestions
00:32:29 about how we need to pay attention to the student’s spiritual progress.
00:32:33 It really should be consistent.
00:32:36 We studied for a long time, a little over a year.
00:32:40 And that’s when I realized that it was time for me
00:32:42 to stop and decide if I should discontinue the study.
00:32:46 Then I put into practice the suggestion from The Watchtower  of January 2020.
00:32:51 I told her: “You really are someone who appreciates God’s Word,
00:32:55 “and you’re always regular with your studies.
00:32:57 “But like we just read about,
00:32:59 there’s some fruitage in your life that’s missing.”
00:33:02 But she responded,
00:33:04 “But I think it’s all in Jehovah’s time.”
00:33:06 So I said, “Jehovah has already invited you personally,
00:33:10 so it’s really up to you now.”
00:33:12 But she kept saying, “Well, to me,
00:33:14 it’ll happen in Jehovah’s time.”
00:33:17 Unfortunately,
00:33:19 it seemed better to discontinue the study
00:33:21 because she showed that she didn’t feel the need to make progress.
00:33:26 This article was a present from Jehovah.
00:33:29 It was like everything that was important
00:33:32 came all together in just one article.
00:33:34 We’re living in urgent times,
00:33:37 so we need to be as efficient as possible.
00:33:40 The spiritual progress a person makes,
00:33:42 which may have taken five years, can take place now.
00:33:57 If you’re currently conducting a Bible study,
00:34:00 did you see any points you could put into practice?
00:34:03 Are you starting each study with prayer
00:34:05 and teaching your student how to pray?
00:34:08 Are you regularly inviting others to join you on the study?
00:34:12 And are you skillfully using questions
00:34:14 to find out what’s really on your student’s mind?
00:34:17 The art of using questions is the topic of our next video in the series
00:34:21 “Iron Sharpens Iron.”
00:34:25 Hi. I’m Armando.
00:34:27 Welcome to “Iron Sharpens Iron.”
00:34:38 We’ve all been there.
00:34:40 We’re out in the ministry
00:34:42 trying to start conversations with people.
00:34:46 But for many of us, it’s not that easy.
00:34:51 Just the idea of talking to a stranger
00:34:53 can be intimidating.
00:34:57 Personally, I’m not someone who finds it easy
00:35:00 to just walk up to a stranger and start a conversation.
00:35:05 But with some effort and time,
00:35:08 I’ve learned a few methods that have helped me to overcome my fears.
00:35:12 Today, we’re going to concentrate on just one of them:
00:35:16 using questions to start
00:35:19 and maintain a conversation.
00:35:22 And perhaps by the time we’re done, you’ll realize like I have
00:35:26 that it’s not as difficult as it seems.
00:35:31 Hi, there.
00:35:32 Ah, well, we’re asking our neighbors a question,
00:35:35 and we’d like to know your opinion.
00:35:38 Have you ever asked yourself what we need to do to have a happy family?
00:35:43 No. I’m not married.
00:35:45 Oh, ah, OK.
00:35:48 Well, we have this brochure that talks about . . .
00:35:53 OK, three things:
00:35:55 First, the brother was nervous.
00:35:58 When we’re nervous, we make the person we’re speaking with nervous too.
00:36:04 Of course, it’s difficult not to be nervous,
00:36:06 but if we concentrate too much on how we feel,
00:36:11 we can forget that what we want to do
00:36:13 is simply to start a conversation.
00:36:16 There’s no pressure; just keep it casual.
00:36:20 Second, yes, the brother did ask a question,
00:36:25 but the question was irrelevant to the householder.
00:36:29 It’s usually better to ask something
00:36:32 that will encourage the person to participate in the conversation
00:36:35 but will also help us to discern what interests them.
00:36:40 Third, one of the biggest fears we have is,
00:36:45 What if my question doesn’t connect with them?
00:36:47 This can throw us off.
00:36:49 We feel like we have nowhere to go.
00:36:52 It would have been better to have a flexible approach
00:36:55 that would allow us to react according to what the person says.
00:37:00 Let’s try it again,
00:37:03 but this time let’s approach the situation a little differently.
00:37:07 In the first few pages of our Bible,
00:37:09 there are 20 questions that we can use in the ministry.
00:37:14 Why not start familiarizing ourselves with them?
00:37:17 We can choose one or two subjects that we like
00:37:20 so that we will be ready when an opportunity arises.
00:37:23 Let’s see how our brother does this in the next demonstration.
00:37:28 Hi, there.
00:37:29 We’re asking our neighbors a question, and we’d love to know your opinion.
00:37:33 What would you say is something that causes you a lot of stress?
00:37:38 Personally, I worry a lot about money and paying all my bills.
00:37:42 Yeah, I think that’s the case for many of us.
00:37:46 Did you know that the Bible explains something
00:37:48 that can help us specifically with that anxiety?
00:37:51 Really?
00:37:53 In the front of my Bible, there are 20 questions that many of us ask
00:37:57 and that the Bible answers.
00:37:59 Notice question 16,
00:38:02 “How can you cope with anxiety?”
00:38:06 Notice what this scripture says in Proverbs 21:5:
00:38:10 “The plans of the diligent . . .”
00:38:13 Much better, right?
00:38:15 Did you notice that when the person answered,
00:38:18 the brother simply opened his Bible to the questions
00:38:21 and found a scripture that allowed him to continue the conversation?
00:38:25 And he didn’t try to hide what he was doing.
00:38:28 He showed the person the tool he was using.
00:38:31 He felt confident that however the person responded,
00:38:35 he would be able to find a useful scripture
00:38:37 that would keep the conversation moving.
00:38:39 So that went pretty well,
00:38:42 but maybe you’re thinking,
00:38:45 ‘It almost never happens like that for me.’
00:38:49 Perhaps in our case,
00:38:53 it’s more like this.
00:38:57 Hi, there.
00:38:58 We’re asking our neighbors a question, and we’d love to know your opinion.
00:39:02 What would you say is something that causes you a lot of stress?
00:39:06 People coming to my door and asking me questions.
00:39:10 I understand.
00:39:12 I’m not a fan of that myself.
00:39:14 But have you ever wondered why we do this?
00:39:19 Now, at this point, the householder may shut down the conversation completely.
00:39:23 And that’s fine. We’re not trying to pressure anyone into talking.
00:39:27 But that second question that the publisher asked
00:39:31 and the fact that he was calm, that he was relaxed,
00:39:34 and that he was not taking himself too seriously
00:39:37 —all of that can open the door for the conversation to continue.
00:39:43 To sum up, remember:
00:39:45 First, be calm and relaxed.
00:39:50 We’re just trying to start a conversation.
00:39:53 Smile; be friendly.
00:39:57 Second, ask a question that brings a person into the conversation
00:40:02 and allows us to discover what interests them.
00:40:06 And third, don’t be nervous about where the conversation could lead.
00:40:12 With our 20 questions for the ministry,
00:40:15 we can be sure that we’ll find an appropriate text
00:40:18 that will keep the conversation directed toward spiritual matters.
00:40:24 This is one of the methods that has helped me,
00:40:27 and I hope that it can help you too
00:40:30 as you see for yourself how “iron sharpens iron.”
00:40:35 Do you sometimes feel like Brother Pérez
00:40:38 and find that it isn’t so easy to walk up to a stranger
00:40:41 and start a conversation?
00:40:44 Using the questions in the front of our Bible
00:40:46 may be just what you need to help get a conversation going.
00:40:51 Of course, making disciples takes more than technical teaching skill.
00:40:55 First and foremost, we have to love people,
00:40:59 regardless of their race, background, or lifestyle.
00:41:03 Jehovah is impartial,
00:41:05 and we have to be the same way as we search out deserving ones.
00:41:09 That was the topic of a recent morning worship
00:41:12 by Brother William Turner.
00:41:14 His talk highlights the many ways we need to imitate Jehovah’s impartiality
00:41:19 not just in our ministry but at all times.
00:41:23 Well, today’s text comments mention
00:41:25 the effect that prejudice
00:41:26 had on Jesus’ disciples.
00:41:28 And as we think about that today
00:41:31 and how we are part of an organization
00:41:33 that is much more diverse
00:41:34 than in the first century,
00:41:36 it raises the question,
00:41:38 Does prejudice still have an impact on God’s people today?
00:41:44 We’re very thankful that we love and serve a God
00:41:47 who does not tolerate prejudice.
00:41:50 The Bible states that quite plainly.
00:41:52 Turn with me, please, to the book of Acts,
00:41:56 and we note the words of the apostle Peter in Acts chapter 10.
00:42:02 In verse 34, it says:
00:42:04 “At this Peter began to speak, and he said:
00:42:08 “‘Now I truly understand
00:42:10 “‘that God is not partial,
00:42:13 “‘but in every nation
00:42:16 “‘the man who fears him and does what is right
00:42:19 is acceptable to him.’”
00:42:22 Now, if you look at the study note,
00:42:23 it mentions that the Greek phrase for “is not partial”
00:42:28 literally means “is not one who takes faces.”
00:42:33 And that perfectly describes Jehovah, doesn’t it?
00:42:36 He does not favor one face, one individual,
00:42:41 over another because of their race, nationality,
00:42:45 social standing, or any other external factors.
00:42:48 And that’s how you and I strive to be as well.
00:42:53 However, we must acknowledge that it is a challenge to be impartial,
00:42:58 largely because in today’s world
00:43:00 we are surrounded by prejudice.
00:43:04 So to answer that question:
00:43:05 Does prejudice have an impact on God’s people today?
00:43:08 —indeed, it does.
00:43:10 We may be victims of it,
00:43:12 or we ourselves might hold some prejudice.
00:43:17 Interestingly, The Watchtower  back in 2013
00:43:20 made this comment, it said:
00:43:23 “If we are honest with ourselves,
00:43:25 “we have to admit that deep down
00:43:28 “we all harbor varying degrees of prejudice
00:43:33 in one form or another.”
00:43:36 So if this is something that is a human tendency
00:43:40 and we’re all plagued with it, at least to some degree,
00:43:44 then how do we overcome it?
00:43:47 Well, it might be helpful to start with the word itself.
00:43:50 As Sister Leithiser mentioned, the dictionary defines prejudice
00:43:53 as “a preconceived opinion
00:43:56 that is not based on reason or actual experience.”
00:44:02 A preconceived opinion
00:44:05 has to do with how we think and how we feel
00:44:10 —thoughts that likely have been shaped by our personal experiences,
00:44:15 our upbringing, and our environment.
00:44:18 Now, maybe when we think of prejudice,
00:44:20 perhaps our minds go to or we focus on racial prejudice
00:44:25 —hatred or animosity toward someone.
00:44:27 We talked a little bit about that last week.
00:44:30 But The Watchtower also mentioned that prejudices
00:44:33 can also be formed against another person because of their weight,
00:44:38 gender, language, social status,
00:44:42 religion, or virtually any perceived difference.
00:44:47 So if prejudice starts with our personality
00:44:51 or our personal preconceived opinions,
00:44:55 then the way to overcome it
00:44:57 has to start by elevating our minds
00:45:00 to God’s way of thinking.
00:45:03 Again, if we go back to the Bible, this time to 1 Samuel chapter 16,
00:45:09 notice how Jehovah brings this to light—1 Samuel chapter 16.
00:45:14 And let’s recall what happens when Samuel goes to the house of Jesse
00:45:18 to appoint one of his sons as king.
00:45:22 Verse 6 says:
00:45:24 “As they came in and he saw Eliab, he said:
00:45:27 “‘Surely here before Jehovah stands his anointed one.’
00:45:33 “But Jehovah said to Samuel:
00:45:35 “‘Do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is,
00:45:39 for I have rejected him.’”
00:45:42 Now, if we stop there for a moment, did you notice what Samuel did?
00:45:46 In this particular instance,
00:45:48 he was as that Greek phrase denoted,
00:45:51 “a taker of faces,” wasn’t he?
00:45:54 He looked at Eliab; he saw how tall and how handsome he looked.
00:45:57 Surely, this must be Jehovah’s choice.
00:46:00 But note how the verse continues; note the teaching point:
00:46:04 “‘For the way man sees is not the way God sees,
00:46:08 “‘because mere man sees what appears to the eyes,
00:46:12 but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”
00:46:17 That’s what matters to Jehovah
00:46:19 —what’s in our heart, what we are on the inside.
00:46:22 And he’s looking for those qualities in each of us
00:46:26 that reflect his impartiality.
00:46:29 Now, how is this of benefit to us,  since you and I cannot read hearts?
00:46:34 Well, let’s go back to the study note.
00:46:36 The rest of the study note for Acts 10:34 gives us the answer,
00:46:40 because it says:
00:46:42 “Imitating God’s impartiality means,
00:46:44 “not making surface judgments,
00:46:48 but paying attention to the character and qualities of others.”
00:46:54 Now, perhaps one way we can illustrate this is with the example of a geode.
00:46:58 Now, look at this picture.
00:47:00 On its outside surface,
00:47:02 a geode looks pretty ordinary and nondescript
00:47:06 —no different than any big rock or stone you’d find outside.
00:47:10 But if you break it open,
00:47:13 ah, quite a different story.
00:47:15 Now, when you look inside,
00:47:17 you see these beautiful sparkling crystals of varying colors
00:47:21 that are just quite beautiful and really radiant to the eye.
00:47:26 Well, what’s our point?
00:47:29 When we make surface judgments
00:47:32 or preconceived opinions about our brothers,
00:47:36 often aren’t we looking at them like the outside of that geode?
00:47:40 All that we see is just the external surface.
00:47:44 And isn’t it so true that perhaps if someone is shy,
00:47:48 quiet, or reserved,
00:47:50 it’s so easy to label them, isn’t it?
00:47:52 We sized them up, and we quickly come to the conclusion:
00:47:55 “Ah, you know what, there’s not much there.
00:47:57 They really don’t have much to offer.”
00:48:00 Or it could be that the person is very talkative, loud, extroverted—same thing.
00:48:04 We label them and form an opinion.
00:48:06 Could it be in those particular instances that we have become
00:48:10 “a taker of faces”?
00:48:12 We’ve made a judgment purely based on personal opinion
00:48:16 or what we feel is acceptable.
00:48:20 But to imitate Jehovah’s way of thinking,
00:48:23 we have to go beyond the surface;
00:48:26 we have to focus on the character and the qualities of our brothers,
00:48:31 and with some people that may take time.
00:48:35 You know, with the geode, one expert stated:
00:48:38 “There are many different ways to open a geode.
00:48:41 “But no matter how you do it,
00:48:44 the key is patience, patience, patience.”
00:48:50 And isn’t it true that it’s the same with our brothers?
00:48:53 It takes time and patience to get to know them,
00:48:56 time and patience to understand the way that they think,
00:49:00 to show personal interest by asking questions,
00:49:03 to work with them in the ministry, and to consider their suggestions.
00:49:08 But when we do, well, we’re rewarded.
00:49:11 We begin to see the crystals;
00:49:14 we begin to see their inner beauty inside;
00:49:18 we discover true depth in our brothers and sisters,
00:49:21 and hopefully they do in us as well.
00:49:24 Now, going back to Jesus’ disciples,
00:49:26 while the Bible candidly details
00:49:29 a number of accounts showing their human traits
00:49:32 and their prejudicial feelings at times,
00:49:34 it also highlights how they overcame those feelings.
00:49:38 Just look at how much we read and meditate on the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:49:43 and how much those verses and books emphasize love,
00:49:48 opening our hearts, loving our brothers,
00:49:50 getting along with one another, and widening out.
00:49:54 The disciples did not allow any deep-rooted feelings
00:49:58 or things from their upbringing or their environment to control them.
00:50:04 And you and I can be the same.
00:50:07 But it all starts with an honest self-examination:
00:50:12 ‘Can I identify any traces of prejudice within me?’
00:50:17 And if we can, well, it all starts with our thinking
00:50:22 —elevating our thinking to Jehovah’s way of thinking.
00:50:27 Let’s avoid surface judgments, being “a taker of faces.”
00:50:31 Let’s take the time to get to know our brothers
00:50:33 and appreciate their character and qualities
00:50:36 —their inner beauty.
00:50:38 Jesus told his disciples at Matthew 23:8:
00:50:42 “All of you are brothers.”
00:50:44 And what made them brothers?
00:50:47 At Matthew 12:50, Jesus said:
00:50:49 “For whoever does the will of my Father . . . ,
00:50:52 “that one is my brother
00:50:55 and sister and mother.”
00:50:58 It’s a nice reminder, isn’t it?
00:51:00 We are all part of a large spiritual family
00:51:03 united by our faith and love for God.
00:51:06 And if we see each other that way,
00:51:08 that will help us to remain humble
00:51:11 and recognize that we have no reason to elevate ourselves above others.
00:51:15 Instead, we’re going to be filled with so much love and appreciation
00:51:20 to be part of this organization
00:51:22 as we imitate our impartial God and Father, Jehovah.
00:51:27 With prejudice and discrimination so rampant in the world around us,
00:51:32 those reminders couldn’t be more timely.
00:51:36 We’ve been talking a lot during this broadcast
00:51:39 about helping our students become disciples.
00:51:42 For those of you who are parents,
00:51:44 your most precious students are, of course, your own children.
00:51:48 As teachers, we have to help them prepare
00:51:51 for the pressures they’ll face in school.
00:51:54 And those pressures are more intense now than ever
00:51:58 —especially when it comes to sexual immorality.
00:52:02 In this episode of My Teen Life, we’ll hear from two young people
00:52:06 who successfully resisted the temptations to have sex.
00:52:10 How did they do it?
00:52:19 Well, every day in high school,
00:52:21 my classmates would talk about sex.
00:52:23 They would just talk about, you know,
00:52:25 their boyfriends and girlfriends
00:52:27 —what they did with them, you know, over the weekend
00:52:30 and what they’re going to do.
00:52:31 They, of course, knew that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:52:34 and that I wouldn’t engage in premarital sex,
00:52:36 but that did not stop them from pushing.
00:52:38 Guys would invade my personal space.
00:52:41 Sometimes they would even try
00:52:43 to, you know, grab or touch me.
00:52:45 One day, a girl in class asked me to touch her inappropriately.
00:52:50 Of course, I rejected her,
00:52:52 but she even started or resorted to calling me names.
00:52:55 She called me lame, and she said that I must be gay.
00:52:58 It seemed to be a game to them to try to break me
00:53:02 and try to get me to do things with them.
00:53:05 But the fact that I wouldn’t give in,
00:53:07 they thought it was fun or funny.
00:53:10 It got to the point where this became very physical.
00:53:13 I had two classmates behind me that were pushing me.
00:53:16 One classmate on each side of me was grabbing my arms
00:53:19 and pushing me, trying to make me touch her.
00:53:21 I knew that it was time to get out of there.
00:53:24 Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:53:26 I was already very different in school,
00:53:29 but I was also very shy.
00:53:32 So at times, I wanted to fit in
00:53:35 with the crowd so that I wouldn’t have that attention on me.
00:53:39 But I knew that this would displease Jehovah
00:53:42 if I, you know, went with the crowd and did what the other kids were doing.
00:53:46 Well, I did say a quick, silent prayer to Jehovah;
00:53:48 I said, “Jehovah, just please help me.”
00:53:50 I immediately in my mind thought of Joseph.
00:53:52 He was able to free himself from Potiphar’s wife,
00:53:56 but he was able to get away because of his resolve to please Jehovah.
00:54:00 And that’s exactly what I knew I needed to do.
00:54:02 And I did just that —I ran right out of the classroom.
00:54:06 Personal study was very important.
00:54:10 This made Jehovah really real to me.
00:54:12 The more real he was to me,
00:54:14 the more I didn’t want to displease him and hurt him.
00:54:18 Having that relationship with him and having that trust in him
00:54:22 really helped me get through those situations
00:54:25 of wanting to fit in and going with the crowd.
00:54:28 Rejecting that girl was not easy,
00:54:31 but I did know that it was the right thing to do.
00:54:33 Shortly before this incident,
00:54:35 my grandmother actually prepared me.
00:54:37 She would prepare Watchtower  articles for me
00:54:40 that talked about how to deal with temptation.
00:54:43 Although those talks with her were super-duper awkward,
00:54:47 if I’m being honest, they really helped me
00:54:49 to stay spiritually strong and to resist the temptation.
00:54:52 My parents always told me to use farsighted wisdom
00:54:57 —to think about how that action would affect me
00:55:02 in the future, affect my relationship with Jehovah
00:55:06 and with my friends and my family.
00:55:08 That definitely went through my head a lot during that time.
00:55:12 All you need to do is trust in Jehovah,
00:55:15 because if you trust in him,
00:55:17 then everything is going to be OK.
00:55:20 The publication that really helped me the most
00:55:22 was the Young People Ask  book, Volume 2,
00:55:25 chapter 5, “Why Stay a Virgin?”
00:55:28 This book was really a lifesaver for me.
00:55:31 Reading about how some of my peers all around the world
00:55:35 are dealing with the exact same temptation
00:55:37 really gave me a sense of comfort
00:55:39 and helped me to feel that I was not alone.
00:55:42 Well, I’m really grateful to Jehovah and the organization
00:55:46 for the love that they show to us young ones
00:55:50 —to help us not feel alone and to help us
00:55:54 push through these difficult situations.
00:55:57 The Young People Ask  book, Volume 2,
00:55:59 chapter 14, “How Can I Protect Myself at School?”
00:56:04 really encouraged me in school
00:56:06 to be firm and to stand my ground to make Jehovah happy.
00:56:12 Well, I’m so thankful to Jehovah for recalling scriptures
00:56:15 like 1 Corinthians 6:18,
00:56:18 which says: “Flee from sexual immorality!”
00:56:20 And I’m happy to say that I was able to do just that.
00:56:23 But, really, what makes me the happiest
00:56:25 is knowing that I made Jehovah happy,
00:56:27 and there is no greater feeling than that.
00:56:48 We know that many of you young ones are just like Kamryn and Cory,
00:56:52 and we’re so proud of you for the courageous stand you take every day.
00:56:56 We know it isn’t easy,
00:56:58 but remember, when you take that stand,
00:57:01 you’re making Jehovah’s heart glad.
00:57:04 It takes courage to be different.
00:57:06 For many of our brothers and sisters
00:57:08 that courage is being tested in a special way.
00:57:11 They’re preaching and making disciples
00:57:13 in lands where the work is restricted or under ban.
00:57:18 How do they muster the courage
00:57:20 to keep on preaching despite opposition?
00:57:23 That’s the theme of this month’s new music video.
00:57:35 I woke up this morning and dressed for the day. I prayed to Jehovah and went on my way.
00:57:49 I was told not to preach, but I cannot bend. God is my Ruler rather than men.
00:58:02 And like the breeze blowing out in the field, I feel peace right here.
00:58:12 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:58:19 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:58:27 As I get back home and think about this day, That man on the bench had so much to say.
00:58:41 So I pray that I’ll see him again there soon. I know he’d feel better if he had the truth.
00:58:54 And like the breeze blowing out in the field, I feel peace right here.
00:59:03 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:59:11 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
00:59:19 Like a fire that’s burning deep in my heart, These words I will speak; I’ll do my part.
00:59:28 I’ll spread his name the best that I can, And I will keep going right down to the end.
00:59:36 Knowing my brothers are fighting this fight, I’ll strengthen my faith, keep it alive.
00:59:43 Trusting Jehovah, his praises I’ll sing, Knowing the new world he soon will bring.
01:00:45 As I lay my head down to sleep tonight, I thank Jehovah and turn out the light.
01:00:58 What tomorrow may bring, I do not know, But I know that I won’t face it alone.
01:01:12 And like the breeze blowing out in the field, I feel peace right here.
01:01:21 I know Jehovah’s with me, so why should I fear?
01:01:29 I know Jehovah’s with me, so I will not fear.
01:01:41 Like the young brother portrayed in our video,
01:01:43 we can gain confidence, knowing that when we’re in the ministry,
01:01:47 Jehovah is with us every step of the way.
01:01:51 Our program has shown us the many ways
01:01:53 Jehovah has equipped us to make disciples
01:01:56 by giving us the best tools
01:01:58 and the best training.
01:02:01 Being a disciple-maker also means being courageous
01:02:04 when it comes to taking a stand for our moral principles
01:02:07 and preaching even when opposed.
01:02:10 We know Jehovah will bless all your hard work
01:02:12 as you go on making disciples.
01:02:16 One part of the world where the disciple-making work
01:02:19 has been thriving for well over 100 years
01:02:22 is Australia, our destination
01:02:25 in this month’s video postcard.
01:02:29 Australia is a vast island continent
01:02:31 four times larger than the largest island in the world.
01:02:35 Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans,
01:02:38 Australia is a land of dramatic contrasts.
01:02:42 It’s the second driest continent after Antarctica,
01:02:46 with vast deserts.
01:02:48 Yet, some of its mountain ranges receive enough snow
01:02:51 to have earned the name the Australian Alps!
01:02:55 Off the coast of Queensland in the northeast,
01:02:58 you’ll find the Great Barrier Reef,
01:03:00 which is the largest coral reef system on earth!
01:03:04 Whether you’re traveling in Australia’s dusty outback
01:03:06 or along the coast,
01:03:09 you’ll likely see many kangaroos.
01:03:11 That’s not surprising because there are
01:03:13 many more kangaroos in Australia than there are people.
01:03:17 Kangaroos are native to Australia, as are many other animals,
01:03:20 including the koala,
01:03:22 wombat,
01:03:24 possum,
01:03:26 emu,
01:03:29 and the unique duck-billed platypus.
01:03:32 Seeds of truth reached Australia
01:03:34 as far back as 1884.
01:03:37 The Australia branch was established in 1904,
01:03:40 making it one of the oldest branches in the world.
01:03:43 Today it’s called the Australasia branch
01:03:46 and oversees the preaching
01:03:48 not just in Australia and New Zealand
01:03:50 but in many islands of the South Pacific.
01:03:54 In the early days,
01:03:56 brothers covered the vast Australian territory
01:03:58 traveling by bicycle, truck, cart,
01:04:02 and even camel.
01:04:05 Today, more than 70,400 publishers and 7,500 pioneers
01:04:10 are preaching in almost 40 different languages.
01:04:13 A special effort is made to reach
01:04:16 Australia’s native Aboriginal people.
01:04:18 To assist those hungering for the truth,
01:04:20 literature has been translated into some of the indigenous languages.
01:04:26 Our Australian brothers and sisters have also found success
01:04:29 preaching on passenger trains and at railway stations.
01:04:34 This is the Broken Hill Station,
01:04:36 a stop on the Indian Pacific  route,
01:04:39 which runs more than 4,300 kilometers,
01:04:42 or about 2,700 miles, from Sydney to Perth.
01:04:45 Many have learned the truth
01:04:47 as a result of the preaching
01:04:49 along this train line.
01:04:51 Most of Australia’s nearly
26 million inhabitants
01:04:54 live in cities and towns not far from the coast.
01:04:57 One of those towns is Nowra,
01:04:59 home of the Nowra-West Congregation.
01:05:03 With a little help from Zoom,
01:05:05 the 80 brothers and sisters
01:05:06 of the Nowra-West Congregation
01:05:08 send you their warmest love.
01:05:12 From the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:05:15 this is JW Broadcasting.
