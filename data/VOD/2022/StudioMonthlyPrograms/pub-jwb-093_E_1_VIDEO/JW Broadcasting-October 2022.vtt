00:00:02.052 --> 00:00:06.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a pleasure to welcome you
to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we look forward to
in this month’s program?

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:12.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the series <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron,”</i>

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:17.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll join an experienced circuit overseer
for some field-tested suggestions

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how we can use questions

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
to start and continue good conversations
in the ministry.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Day after day,
our young people are tested

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
to compromise their integrity.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll meet Cory and Kamryn,

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:33.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
two young people
who talk frankly about the pressure

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:35.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
they faced in high school to have sex.

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:38.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they resist temptation

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:40.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stand their ground?

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:44.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you find the idea
of conducting a Bible study intimidating?

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a new dramatization,

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade conducts her first Bible study

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learns what it takes
to be an effective teacher.

00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the October 2022 edition
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.894 line:10% position:50% align:center
For over 100 years,

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:19.262 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:20.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
has been producing books

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:22.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
to help us teach people Bible truths.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
when some of these study books were released? 

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:29.739 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>“This Means Everlasting Life” </i>

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:32.275 line:10% position:50% align:center
was released in 1950;

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.477 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</i>

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:36.479 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1968;

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.915 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,</i>

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:40.784 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1982;

00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:43.787 line:10% position:50% align:center
and <i>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life,</i>

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:45.789 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1995.

00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:49.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did those titles have in common?

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:52.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed that it’s possible
for a person to learn

00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:55.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah requires to live forever.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:57.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why
we keep searching for people

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:00.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are “rightly disposed
for everlasting life”

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who are willing
to study the Bible with us.

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:07.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of those books and several more
that we published since then

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:09.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been instrumental in helping people

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:12.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
become believers
in our wonderful hope for the future.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:17.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2021,
we added one more book to the list, entitled 

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.390 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.692 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course.</i>

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
This title adds another element:

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s possible
not only to gain everlasting life

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:32.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to learn how to enjoy life even now.

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:38.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title is taken from Psalm 22:26,
which says:

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those seeking Jehovah will praise him.

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:44.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you enjoy life forever.”

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:47.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
This newest study publication
is very different

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all the others that we’ve produced.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:53.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this broadcast,
we want to explain

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:55.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
what went on behind the scenes

00:02:55.058 --> 00:02:57.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
to produce <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:00.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the direction of the Governing Body,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
hundreds of Bethelites around the world

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:04.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked very hard to make it possible

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to have this innovative study tool.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, they’ll be quick to say
that all credit for this goes to Jehovah.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we can say

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:19.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as the prophet Isaiah said
in ancient times of our great God:

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, . . .

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:25.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything we have done
you have accomplished for us.”

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:28.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that any success we enjoy

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:30.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because of Jehovah’s direction
and blessing.

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:34.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the theme of this presentation is

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:37.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“See What Jehovah Has Done for Us!”

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:42.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The faithful and discreet slave”
has always taken very seriously

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:45.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ command
recorded at Matthew 28:19:

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:50.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go, . . . and make disciples of people
of all the nations, baptizing them.”

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what our Bible study activity
aims to accomplish.

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
For decades,
our method of conducting studies

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
was to study printed material
paragraph by paragraph.

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:04.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
When answering
the questions for the paragraphs,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
some students would often just repeat
what was stated in the book.

00:04:08.364 --> 00:04:10.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
it was hard to know whether the truth

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:12.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
was really touching their heart.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
With <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
we’re using a different method of teaching

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
that generates candid expressions
by the students in their own words.

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:24.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is just what the Governing Body
feels is needed

00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring new ones to dedication and baptism

00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
during these urgent last days.

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:33.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve begun conducting Bible studies
with <i>Enjoy Life Forever!,</i>

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:36.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can appreciate
how it’s adjusting our Bible study work.

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:40.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what some longtime pioneers have said

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:43.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
after covering just one lesson
on their studies:

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This was
the most beautiful spiritual conversation

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have ever had with a student!”

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My student revealed things
she had never told me before.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt as if I was hearing her heart
for the first time!”

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It truly reaches the heart
and motivates students to action.”

00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:08.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one brother wrote:
“I am so excited about this new Bible course

00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I am begging Jehovah to hear my prayers

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to conduct progressive studies.”

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:19.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was early in 2019
when the Writing Committee

00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:23.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
took on the amazing project to produce
a new Bible study tool.

00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:26.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
They assembled a team of writers,
designers, and consultants

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:31.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
to investigate whether we could improve
the publications that we were then using.

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:34.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the very first discussion session,

00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:38.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone was encouraged
to pray often about the task at hand

00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:42.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to pray when thinking about it,
when brainstorming with others,

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:44.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when working on it—

00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:47.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to respond
to the influence of holy spirit.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why pray so much?

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:55.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 16:3 gives the answer:

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Commit to Jehovah whatever you do,

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:01.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your plans will succeed.”

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:05.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
The team was also encouraged
to think outside the box,

00:06:05.314 --> 00:06:07.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means to think outside, or beyond,

00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:10.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way things
have always been done in the past.

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:13.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Times have changed,
people have changed,

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the way that many prefer to be taught
has changed.

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:20.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
These days they respond better to multimedia

00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
that engages them
and holds their attention.

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
The team was shown a puzzle

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:28.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
that illustrates what it means
to think outside the box

00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:31.407 line:10% position:50% align:center
—the nine-dots puzzle.

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:34.177 line:10% position:50% align:center
The challenge is to connect all nine dots

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:36.245 line:10% position:50% align:center
with just four straight lines.

00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:37.914 line:10% position:50% align:center
Here are a few examples

00:06:37.914 --> 00:06:39.949 line:10% position:50% align:center
of how some will try to solve the puzzle.

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:41.951 line:10% position:50% align:center
Notice that with each attempt

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:43.719 line:10% position:50% align:center
one dot is missed.

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:45.555 line:10% position:50% align:center
The problem is that our mind tends

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:47.623 line:10% position:50% align:center
to build a box around the dots,

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:49.125 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that instantly limits

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.827 line:10% position:50% align:center
what we can imagine.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.629 line:10% position:50% align:center
The only way to connect all nine dots

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.631 line:10% position:50% align:center
with just four straight lines

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:57.900 line:10% position:50% align:center
is by going outside the box

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.535 line:10% position:50% align:center
and thinking differently

00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:01.571 line:10% position:50% align:center
than we normally would.

00:07:03.372 --> 00:07:06.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point was to show
that novel, creative thinking

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
was needed to imagine something

00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:11.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
other than the traditional way
of studying the Bible with people.

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:14.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s spirit guiding fresh thinking,

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:18.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would be interesting to see
what innovative ideas could be thought of

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
for how to teach the truth to Bible students.

00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:23.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet,
it was felt that our brothers and sisters

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:27.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
would need to see some familiar features
in the new publication.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why the first part of each lesson

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed
similar to the <i>Good News</i>  brochure.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
It features numbered questions,

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:37.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
each followed by a paragraph

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:38.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
that briefly covers fundamental facts

00:07:38.908 --> 00:07:40.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the topic.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, the “Dig Deeper” section

00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:44.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
reasons on the topic,

00:07:44.147 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows how to apply what’s learned,

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:48.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and discusses what the topic teaches us

00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:50.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah.

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes features found

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:53.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the <i>Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook </i>

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:55.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
—bulleted discussion points,

00:07:55.858 --> 00:07:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
scriptures to read,

00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:58.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
videos to play,

00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:00.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and viewpoint questions to answer.

00:08:01.364 --> 00:08:03.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like the study articles
in <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:08:03.766 --> 00:08:07.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
the last part of each lesson
includes just three review questions.

00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:11.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was decided that we could cover
much less printed material

00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:14.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let the Bible do the teaching

00:08:14.677 --> 00:08:17.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we need
to draw out the student’s feelings

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
with well-worded viewpoint questions

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:22.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and include videos and generous artwork.

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:24.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must help the student

00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:27.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see Jehovah as a real Person

00:08:27.223 --> 00:08:30.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to develop
a warm relationship with him

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:32.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encourage the student
to get into a routine

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:35.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
of regular Bible reading, prayer,
and meeting attendance.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:41.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  provide
what we need to accomplish all of that?

00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:43.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly does!

00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:47.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scriptures
are the focal point of each lesson,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the student is prompted
to find answers in the Bible.

00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:55.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
The questions draw out the student’s feelings
about what he’s learning.

00:08:55.685 --> 00:08:57.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in the course,
students are helped

00:08:57.853 --> 00:09:00.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
to appreciate what Jehovah is like,

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:03.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel his love for them,

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:06.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see how to draw close to him
as their Friend.

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:11.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
The beautiful artwork and motivating videos
have real emotional impact.

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:16.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
This project to produce <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:09:16.072 --> 00:09:19.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
required the collaboration
of six departments at world headquarters.

00:09:20.743 --> 00:09:22.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
As directed by the Governing Body,

00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:25.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Writing Department researched, wrote,

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:28.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and proofread the text for each lesson.

00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:31.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
These were then sent to hundreds
of brothers and sisters around the world

00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:34.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
to test them on their Bible studies.

00:09:35.057 --> 00:09:38.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Writing Department coordinated the work
with other departments

00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:40.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep the project on schedule.

00:09:41.564 --> 00:09:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Translation Services helped to simplify

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
the vocabulary and logic of what was written.

00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:49.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
They identified any English text

00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:53.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be a problem for translators
to render in their local languages.

00:09:54.543 --> 00:09:56.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
As of right now,
<i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:09:56.912 --> 00:10:00.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been approved
in upward of 700 languages.

00:10:01.117 --> 00:10:03.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Art Department designed

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:05.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the book’s layout and artwork.

00:10:05.388 --> 00:10:07.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teams in several branches photographed models

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help the illustrators

00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:11.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
create the many beautiful scenes

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
that appear in the book,

00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:15.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
which contains over 600 images.

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:18.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
MEPS Programming developed new tools

00:10:18.067 --> 00:10:21.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the digital version of the book
in the <i>JW Library®</i>  app

00:10:21.937 --> 00:10:24.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
would look similar to the printed edition.

00:10:24.807 --> 00:10:26.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the first publication

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:29.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
for which both print and digital formats

00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:31.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
were designed simultaneously.

00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:35.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Text Processing Services
composed the text and artwork

00:10:35.618 --> 00:10:37.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
for both the print and digital formats,

00:10:37.987 --> 00:10:40.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
transcribed the book into English braille,

00:10:40.323 --> 00:10:41.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
and instructed the branches

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how to produce the book

00:10:43.092 --> 00:10:44.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their languages.

00:10:44.994 --> 00:10:48.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Audio/Video Services
produced several new videos and excerpts

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:52.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
of many existing videos
from the jw.org website.

00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:56.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also produced
unique audio recordings of the book

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:59.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
that include various voices and sounds.

00:11:00.776 --> 00:11:02.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was truly a collaborative effort!

00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:04.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there was a major problem

00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:06.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could have stalled this project:

00:11:06.982 --> 00:11:08.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
COVID-19.

00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:12.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
When world headquarters and the branches
were locked down,

00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:16.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
60 percent of the project
still needed to be completed.

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:19.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, the Governing Body
had given it high priority.

00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:23.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video will give you some idea

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:27.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how the departments 
worked together to get their work done

00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:30.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the challenges
they faced during the pandemic.

00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:33.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything about <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:11:33.209 --> 00:11:35.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
is different from any other publication

00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:36.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve produced in the past.

00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:37.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from the start of the project,

00:11:37.847 --> 00:11:39.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
two things were critical:

00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:41.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
good communication and good documentation.

00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:43.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
But honestly, time and again,

00:11:43.219 --> 00:11:45.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
the thing that proved
to be the most important

00:11:45.254 --> 00:11:46.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
was reliance on Jehovah.

00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:48.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Writing Committee’s goal was to create

00:11:48.524 --> 00:11:51.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
a first-class digital experience

00:11:51.026 --> 00:11:53.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would engage Bible students.

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:56.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
The digital design system
had to be completely remodeled

00:11:57.767 --> 00:11:59.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i> would look uniform

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:01.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s viewed in <i>JW Library®,</i>

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org, or in print.

00:12:03.773 --> 00:12:06.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right from the inception of this project,

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:07.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers looked for input

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:09.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the study material would be

00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:12.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
easily available
in as many languages as possible.

00:12:12.214 --> 00:12:15.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for that reason,
a team from Translation Services

00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:17.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked along with the writers.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
A publication of this size would usually take

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:22.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
about two or three years to complete,

00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:23.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the Writing Committee

00:12:23.392 --> 00:12:25.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
was really interested
in getting the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
out there as soon as possible.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.398 line:10% position:50% align:center
The <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.400 line:10% position:50% align:center
required an intense amount of collaboration.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.468 line:10% position:50% align:center
Right from the beginning,

00:12:32.468 --> 00:12:33.469 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Writing Committee

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:35.104 line:10% position:50% align:center
got all six departments together

00:12:35.104 --> 00:12:37.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we could work unitedly
through the production.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our existing tool set didn’t have the ability

00:13:13.943 --> 00:13:16.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
to style digital publications
like we can with print.

00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:21.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could do black text
on a white background with gray boxes.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the extent of the functionality
that we had available.

00:13:25.254 --> 00:13:28.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i> 
is very interactive for the student.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
When producing the audio
for this publication,

00:13:30.426 --> 00:13:33.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
we endeavored to maintain that feel.

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we added multiple voices, musical cues

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:39.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in some cases,
the audio track for the video

00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:42.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
was reedited to teach the point effectively.

00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:44.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got to Lesson 32,

00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:46.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
we felt that it might be too complicated

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:48.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build as a digital experience,

00:13:48.711 --> 00:13:51.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that’s when
the collaboration really paid off.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took every tool that we had

00:13:53.716 --> 00:13:56.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
and basically every trick in order to build

00:13:56.018 --> 00:13:58.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
the digital version of that lesson.

00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:00.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we were working on the prototype,

00:14:00.356 --> 00:14:02.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would collaborate
with the User Experience Group

00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:04.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that the look and feel
of the digital edition

00:14:04.894 --> 00:14:07.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the same whether it was on a large device

00:14:07.329 --> 00:14:09.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a small device.

00:14:09.365 --> 00:14:11.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
The entire chart is a visual aid.

00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:13.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wanted to be sure
that all of our users,

00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:15.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially those who are visually impaired,

00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:18.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be able to understand
the teaching point.

00:14:18.207 --> 00:14:20.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
This required us to build the chart

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:23.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that screen readers could read the text

00:14:23.178 --> 00:14:26.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that each picture would have
a description for those who needed it.

00:14:27.249 --> 00:14:30.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in the concept stage,
we understood that there would be

00:14:30.219 --> 00:14:32.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 200 videos in this publication,

00:14:32.221 --> 00:14:34.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
requiring thousands of hours of work:

00:14:34.356 --> 00:14:36.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
eight brand new videos

00:14:36.358 --> 00:14:39.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of the remaining videos,
around 60 would need to be edited.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:43.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as eight new videos
were entering their production phase,

00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
COVID-19 hit,
effectively halting

00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:47.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
video production around the world.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
This work stoppage continued
until each branch could determine

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:53.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they could film safely

00:14:53.776 --> 00:14:56.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still meet the deadline
only nine months away.

00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:59.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the pandemic,
photo sessions here at headquarters

00:14:59.214 --> 00:15:01.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
were completely stopped for four months.

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:04.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as things progressed,
we were able to resume photography,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
only by adhering to strict protocols.

00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:10.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we had a family photograph themselves

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:12.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
while being directed
by the Art Department here.

00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:16.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
So everything that a Bible study conductor
had been trained to do

00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
—ask all the important questions,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
develop love for Jehovah
in their Bible students, show videos—

00:15:21.236 --> 00:15:23.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s all built into the publication.

00:15:23.772 --> 00:15:26.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
So would the concept work
with actual Bible students?

00:15:26.942 --> 00:15:29.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find out, we did in-house testing.

00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:30.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then at the same time,

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:34.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
we sent out the lessons
around the world to publishers, pioneers,

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
missionaries, and circuit overseers.

00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:38.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they used the lessons
with actual Bible students.

00:15:38.988 --> 00:15:41.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tested every lesson of the book this way.

00:15:41.457 --> 00:15:43.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the responses
that we got back were analyzed,

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we made further refinements.

00:15:45.794 --> 00:15:49.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had hundreds of team meetings,
and we felt Jehovah’s holy spirit

00:15:49.498 --> 00:15:52.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
equipping all of us
after we opened a meeting with prayer.

00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:55.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you collaborate,
you get a better product.

00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:59.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s more direct, simpler,
and easier to understand.

00:15:59.508 --> 00:16:00.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, thinking ahead

00:16:00.843 --> 00:16:03.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
about potential translation problems
and addressing them

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:06.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped expedite translation
in hundreds of languages.

00:16:21.964 --> 00:16:23.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that Jehovah helped us

00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:26.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
accomplish this job
in a shorter amount of time

00:16:26.135 --> 00:16:28.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a quality
that would have been very difficult

00:16:28.137 --> 00:16:30.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
even under normal circumstances.

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:32.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
How amazing Jehovah is!

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:37.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the Governing Body
wholeheartedly embracing the project

00:16:37.846 --> 00:16:41.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everyone on the production team
willingly giving their all,

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:44.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could see clear evidence
of Jehovah’s backing.

00:16:45.788 --> 00:16:49.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that we’ve seen
what Jehovah has wonderfully done for us,

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:51.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
what must we do for him?

00:16:52.227 --> 00:16:55.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,
Jesus’ command at Matthew 28:19, 20

00:16:55.864 --> 00:16:58.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
applies to all Christians.

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:00.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding that command,
note what the article

00:17:00.803 --> 00:17:03.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep Busy During the Last
of ‘the Last Days’” states

00:17:03.872 --> 00:17:07.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the October 2019 issue of <i>The Watchtower: </i>

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As we conduct Bible studies,

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:13.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have to try our best
to ‘make disciples . . . ,

00:17:13.716 --> 00:17:18.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“teaching them to observe
all the things [Jesus has] commanded.’

00:17:18.153 --> 00:17:21.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We need to help people understand
how important it is

00:17:21.356 --> 00:17:24.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for them to take their stand
for Jehovah and his Kingdom.

00:17:24.993 --> 00:17:28.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This means trying to motivate people
to make the truth their own

00:17:28.864 --> 00:17:33.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by applying what they learn,
dedicating their life to Jehovah,

00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:35.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and getting baptized.

00:17:35.037 --> 00:17:38.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only then will they survive Jehovah’s day.”

00:17:39.108 --> 00:17:40.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
In most parts of the earth,

00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:43.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
people are not waiting in line
for Bible studies.

00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to be proactive,
trying our best to find people

00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:50.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom we can start and conduct
progressive studies,

00:17:50.552 --> 00:17:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
using our interactive Bible course.

00:17:53.288 --> 00:17:56.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want as many righthearted persons
as possible

00:17:56.391 --> 00:17:59.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become
Jehovah’s willing, loyal Witnesses.

00:18:00.262 --> 00:18:04.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are seven suggestions
you can write down now and try later.

00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:06.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really work!

00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:09.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first and most important is:

00:18:09.071 --> 00:18:11.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray for a Bible study.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never underestimate the power of prayer,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
so be specific in your prayers
and keep praying for studies.

00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:24.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work in harmony with your prayers
by offering studies at every opportunity,

00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:26.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
including to your relatives
and acquaintances.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Show people the brochure.

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:36.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use the intriguing question on the back cover
to pique their interest.

00:18:36.465 --> 00:18:41.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
It asks:
“Is it possible to enjoy life forever?”

00:18:41.236 --> 00:18:44.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Offer to cover the three introductory lessons
in the brochure.

00:18:44.973 --> 00:18:46.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that,
the person can decide

00:18:46.975 --> 00:18:48.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether to continue

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the rest of the Bible course
in the book.

00:18:51.513 --> 00:18:54.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Try the direct approach.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Introduce yourself as a Bible teacher,

00:18:57.052 --> 00:18:59.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come right out and ask people

00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:01.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether they would like
to learn more about the Bible.

00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:06.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Explain that we have a most enjoyable
and easy interactive Bible course

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:09.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that you have openings
in your teaching schedule.

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:15.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) Ask your studies for referrals.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can do this while studying
the first paragraph of lesson 01.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
It asks: “Do you think that the Bible
can help anyone you know?”

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:28.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
If your student mentions a friend,
a relative, a neighbor, or a workmate,

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
offer to demonstrate the course
to that person.

00:19:32.487 --> 00:19:35.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
(5) Approach meeting attenders.

00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:40.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t assume that interested ones
you see at congregation meetings

00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:41.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
are already studying.

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:44.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask them,
and if they are not currently studying,

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:46.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
offer to get them started.

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:52.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
(6) Ask non-Witness marriage mates.

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:56.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was the last time
they were offered a Bible study?

00:19:56.044 --> 00:19:58.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if they had declined an offer
in the past,

00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
they might be interested now.

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:04.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they may prefer to study
with someone outside their family.

00:20:05.254 --> 00:20:09.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
And (7) talk to those who’ve studied before.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:13.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you study with someone years ago
in one of our other publications

00:20:13.562 --> 00:20:15.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
who did not make any progress?

00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:17.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not contact them,

00:20:17.699 --> 00:20:20.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
explain that we have
a new interactive Bible course,

00:20:20.903 --> 00:20:23.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask if they’d like to study again?

00:20:23.605 --> 00:20:28.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may be just what they need now
to act on what they learn.

00:20:30.012 --> 00:20:32.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
A key principle that applies to the efforts

00:20:32.347 --> 00:20:34.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
we put forth in the Bible study work

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
is found at Galatians 6:9, which says:

00:20:38.954 --> 00:20:42.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So let us not give up in doing what is fine,

00:20:42.457 --> 00:20:44.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for in due time we will reap

00:20:44.459 --> 00:20:46.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we do not tire out.”

00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:50.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may we never lose our enthusiasm
in making disciples

00:20:50.966 --> 00:20:53.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor relax our efforts.

00:20:53.268 --> 00:20:56.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s rich blessing
on our Bible study activity

00:20:56.939 --> 00:20:59.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
using <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:20:59.274 --> 00:21:01.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be able to say thankfully:

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:04.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, . . . everything we have done

00:21:04.246 --> 00:21:07.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have accomplished for us”!

00:21:09.885 --> 00:21:12.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way we’ve been trained
to become better disciple-makers

00:21:12.921 --> 00:21:15.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
is through the videos.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
when we first met Neeta and Jade

00:21:18.427 --> 00:21:22.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the 2020 “Always Rejoice”! Convention?

00:21:22.264 --> 00:21:25.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
That series provided so many valuable lessons

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what it takes
to be an effective teacher.

00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:31.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month we have another new dramatization.

00:21:31.473 --> 00:21:35.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this episode,
the story has come full circle,

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jade now conducting
her first Bible study

00:21:38.947 --> 00:21:41.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
using <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:12.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stop the ball!

00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:16.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s your biggest question about life?

00:22:16.952 --> 00:22:19.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are people so obsessed
with kicking round objects?

00:22:22.257 --> 00:22:23.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s that.

00:22:23.825 --> 00:22:27.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
But seriously, anything?

00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:33.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do people hate?

00:22:33.301 --> 00:22:35.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re all God’s children, what’s the deal?

00:22:36.471 --> 00:22:40.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good question
and one the Bible definitely answers, um.

00:22:41.476 --> 00:22:43.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’ve a train to catch.

00:22:43.845 --> 00:22:45.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ll stop there.

00:22:45.247 --> 00:22:47.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, um, is Tuesday still good?

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:53.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Assuming space-time hasn’t collapsed
into a singularity,

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:54.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m open.

00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:59.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, cool.

00:23:00.929 --> 00:23:03.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, um, on Tuesday, we’ll carry on with,

00:23:04.199 --> 00:23:06.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
um, that chapter, this section here . . .

00:23:07.069 --> 00:23:08.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:09.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:24.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
So?

00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:28.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
How’s the study going?

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:29.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brilliant!

00:23:29.524 --> 00:23:31.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re zipping right through the easy stuff.

00:23:35.797 --> 00:23:37.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what I love about this prophecy

00:23:37.732 --> 00:23:40.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that it was written,
like, 200 years before it actually happened,

00:23:40.969 --> 00:23:43.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every single detail came true.

00:23:44.072 --> 00:23:47.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
The men in charge just left the gates open.

00:23:49.377 --> 00:23:52.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, I would have fired anyone
that got drunk

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and left the city gates open.

00:23:57.819 --> 00:24:00.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyway, back to the prophecy . . .

00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:03.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
So “God is love,”
but he’s going to kill billions.

00:24:03.391 --> 00:24:04.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does that work?

00:24:04.459 --> 00:24:06.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’ll make sense later.

00:24:06.495 --> 00:24:07.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for now,

00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:10.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s just focus on what
I was talking about earlier.

00:24:10.065 --> 00:24:12.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s so nice about this chapter
is that it’s talking about prayer.

00:24:12.767 --> 00:24:16.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s talking about how Jehovah
helps us with prayer,

00:24:16.171 --> 00:24:19.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so it’s really lovely because we can pray
to someone that’s created . . .

00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:23.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, all of this is evidence
of “the last days.”

00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:30.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would you say
are the signs of the last days?

00:24:33.421 --> 00:24:35.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wars,

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
disasters,

00:24:38.927 --> 00:24:41.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
rude people, mm, yeah.

00:24:43.598 --> 00:24:44.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anything else?

00:24:46.201 --> 00:24:47.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, that’s fine.

00:24:51.206 --> 00:24:54.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can just, um—
We’ll just review it in the next lesson.

00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:55.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s fine.

00:24:55.443 --> 00:24:57.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to just wrap it up now then?

00:24:57.245 --> 00:24:58.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:25:02.984 --> 00:25:04.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is everything OK?

00:25:06.154 --> 00:25:07.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Blissful.

00:25:08.823 --> 00:25:10.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to go.

00:25:10.959 --> 00:25:13.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right. Bye, Gladys.

00:25:23.838 --> 00:25:25.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she just said one word, I just—

00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:27.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know what to do.

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:31.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! Thankfully I’ve never had
a student like that.

00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, she’s really getting
a hang of this irony thing, isn’t she?

00:25:38.987 --> 00:25:41.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
But seriously, I—

00:25:41.423 --> 00:25:45.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really put myself into the study
to try and make it live.

00:25:45.827 --> 00:25:47.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I get “Yes,”

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No,”

00:25:49.531 --> 00:25:50.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maybe,”

00:25:50.932 --> 00:25:53.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
or another insufferable, off-topic question.

00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:58.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe let’s do a bit of research?

00:25:59.374 --> 00:26:00.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew you’d say that.

00:26:02.544 --> 00:26:03.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll put the kettle on.

00:26:04.212 --> 00:26:05.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks, Keesha.

00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:07.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we go

00:26:07.682 --> 00:26:11.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
—October 2020 <i>Watchtower—</i>
this box.

00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:20.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Exercise self-control
by not talking too much.”

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I do need help.

00:26:27.469 --> 00:26:28.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look:

00:26:28.737 --> 00:26:31.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let the student see
that you’re excited about Bible truths.”

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spot-on there!

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:37.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Make friends in the congregation.”

00:26:39.047 --> 00:26:43.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, I could, or maybe we could, do this.

00:26:43.818 --> 00:26:48.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look for signs
that reveal [her] desire to serve Jehovah.”

00:26:49.457 --> 00:26:51.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who’s free on Friday?

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, Jade. I’m busy.

00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:54.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:26:55.697 --> 00:26:57.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah. I’d love to.

00:26:58.166 --> 00:26:59.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:27:05.507 --> 00:27:09.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, Jade, Jade, my tablet?

00:27:09.077 --> 00:27:11.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
No? Gone. OK.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:24.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a surprise today:

00:27:24.926 --> 00:27:29.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
My usual lecture has been canceled
in favor of a discussion, and . . .

00:27:31.433 --> 00:27:33.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, I’m not really the drumroll type.

00:27:33.702 --> 00:27:34.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, hey.

00:27:34.969 --> 00:27:35.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:27:35.804 --> 00:27:38.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m Neeta, one of Jade’s roommates.

00:27:38.173 --> 00:27:39.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re?

00:27:39.574 --> 00:27:40.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gladys.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:46.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s start with the question
you hit me with last time,

00:27:46.815 --> 00:27:49.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is, Why do we stay neutral
when we see injustice?

00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:53.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
I take it you’ve had your fair share?

00:27:55.223 --> 00:27:56.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:27:56.624 --> 00:27:57.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too,

00:27:57.792 --> 00:28:01.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
although not as bad as my mum and dad
from what they tell me.

00:28:01.863 --> 00:28:04.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how will things ever change
if we don’t do something about it?

00:28:06.067 --> 00:28:08.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what the Bible has to say

00:28:08.136 --> 00:28:13.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Jeremiah 10:23.

00:28:13.007 --> 00:28:15.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you read that?

00:28:15.677 --> 00:28:17.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know, O Jehovah,

00:28:17.979 --> 00:28:20.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that man’s way does not belong to him.

00:28:21.015 --> 00:28:22.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It does not belong to man who is walking

00:28:22.984 --> 00:28:25.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
even to direct his step.”

00:28:26.254 --> 00:28:29.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if that’s true,
then the future of the human race

00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:32.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
is looking quite bleak.

00:28:32.127 --> 00:28:33.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean then

00:28:33.261 --> 00:28:36.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there’s no hope for us
and there’s no point in carrying on?

00:28:36.931 --> 00:28:38.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm. Good question.

00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:42.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good question.

00:28:44.439 --> 00:28:47.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade was excited to conduct a study,

00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:51.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she learned that making disciples
takes more than just enthusiasm.

00:28:51.513 --> 00:28:54.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also requires the patience
and the self-control

00:28:54.916 --> 00:28:57.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk less and listen more.

00:28:57.919 --> 00:29:01.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neeta helped Jade improve her teaching
by doing a little research

00:29:01.856 --> 00:29:04.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the October 2020 issue of <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:07.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
which featured two study articles

00:29:07.028 --> 00:29:09.230 line:10% position:50% align:center
on conducting Bible studies.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.732 line:10% position:50% align:center
Earlier that same year,

00:29:10.732 --> 00:29:12.400 line:10% position:50% align:center
the January issue featured

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.068 line:10% position:50% align:center
another study article entitled

00:29:14.068 --> 00:29:16.704 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Go, Therefore, and Make Disciples.”

00:29:18.106 --> 00:29:19.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
That article was filled with suggestions

00:29:19.908 --> 00:29:23.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how to help our students
draw closer to Jehovah.

00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:28.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to the impact those suggestions
have had on three regular pioneers

00:29:28.383 --> 00:29:32.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our next video from the series
<i>Lessons From The Watchtower.</i>

00:29:47.602 --> 00:29:49.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal as teachers

00:29:49.637 --> 00:29:53.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to help the person
to become a disciple of Christ.

00:29:55.477 --> 00:29:56.611 line:10% position:50% align:center
I want my student

00:29:56.611 --> 00:29:57.679 line:10% position:50% align:center
to love Jehovah

00:29:57.679 --> 00:29:58.713 line:10% position:50% align:center
the same way that I do.

00:29:59.347 --> 00:30:00.548 line:10% position:50% align:center
What I most enjoy

00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:01.816 line:10% position:50% align:center
is conducting Bible studies.

00:30:02.383 --> 00:30:03.818 line:10% position:50% align:center
Being able to see

00:30:03.818 --> 00:30:05.053 line:10% position:50% align:center
a student grow spiritually

00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:07.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a joy that can’t be put into words.

00:30:08.523 --> 00:30:10.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of January 2020

00:30:10.792 --> 00:30:13.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentions several things
that we need to keep in mind

00:30:13.795 --> 00:30:15.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we conduct a study.

00:30:16.197 --> 00:30:18.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Studying the article,

00:30:18.199 --> 00:30:21.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how many changes I needed to make
when I conduct a Bible study.

00:30:22.437 --> 00:30:25.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
It highlighted that besides helping
the student to gain knowledge,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s even more important
that we help them progress

00:30:28.209 --> 00:30:31.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the point of dedicating
their lives to Jehovah

00:30:31.045 --> 00:30:33.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course, getting baptized.

00:30:33.047 --> 00:30:35.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I read
about how we should stop studying

00:30:35.984 --> 00:30:38.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
with nonprogressive Bible studies,

00:30:38.019 --> 00:30:40.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t feel comfortable doing it

00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:43.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was afraid
I might make the wrong decision.

00:30:43.992 --> 00:30:45.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although I was pretty sure

00:30:45.994 --> 00:30:48.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
that my Bible student wasn’t yet married

00:30:48.263 --> 00:30:50.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
(that is legally married,

00:30:50.999 --> 00:30:54.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
she had never told me this directly),

00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:57.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just didn’t feel comfortable
talking with her about it.

00:30:58.006 --> 00:31:01.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a Bible student who always prepared for

00:31:01.242 --> 00:31:02.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
and commented well at the study.

00:31:02.777 --> 00:31:04.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
I kept inviting her to the meetings,

00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:07.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she never went to a single one,

00:31:07.448 --> 00:31:10.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she never attended the Memorial.

00:31:10.018 --> 00:31:14.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw that she still had ties
with some aspects of her religion.

00:31:17.592 --> 00:31:20.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article brought out
that in the first few weeks,

00:31:20.428 --> 00:31:22.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
as soon as the study becomes regular,

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s important to start praying
with the student.

00:31:24.732 --> 00:31:27.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
It used to take me a long time
to start doing that.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.605 line:10% position:50% align:center
The article helped me

00:31:30.605 --> 00:31:31.940 line:10% position:50% align:center
because it encouraged me

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.775 line:10% position:50% align:center
to bring others with me on the study

00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:37.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also not to be afraid

00:31:37.045 --> 00:31:39.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring along those
who are more experienced.

00:31:40.648 --> 00:31:43.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the article,
it brought out how important it is

00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:45.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just for us to pray with our students

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to help them

00:31:47.922 --> 00:31:50.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
to begin saying their own prayers as well.

00:31:51.593 --> 00:31:54.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, when the study became regular,

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:57.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d pray before and after each session.

00:31:57.932 --> 00:31:59.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I encouraged each of them

00:31:59.968 --> 00:32:02.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
to also begin praying to Jehovah personally.

00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:05.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
So praying became a daily habit for them.

00:32:06.441 --> 00:32:09.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
A circuit overseer’s wife
went with me on my study,

00:32:09.777 --> 00:32:12.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she asked my student
if she was married.

00:32:12.747 --> 00:32:14.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, I’m married.”

00:32:14.749 --> 00:32:16.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But are you legally married?”

00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:19.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then she responded, “No.”

00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:23.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that really opened up an opportunity

00:32:23.257 --> 00:32:26.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
for me to help the student out
with this situation.

00:32:27.829 --> 00:32:29.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article gave some suggestions

00:32:29.931 --> 00:32:32.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how we need to pay attention
to the student’s spiritual progress.

00:32:33.768 --> 00:32:35.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really should be consistent.

00:32:36.704 --> 00:32:40.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
We studied for a long time,
a little over a year.

00:32:40.608 --> 00:32:42.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s when I realized
that it was time for me

00:32:42.944 --> 00:32:46.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stop and decide
if I should discontinue the study.

00:32:46.481 --> 00:32:50.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I put into practice the suggestion
from <i>The Watchtower</i>  of January 2020.

00:32:51.352 --> 00:32:55.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told her: “You really are someone
who appreciates God’s Word,

00:32:55.289 --> 00:32:57.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you’re always regular
with your studies.

00:32:57.692 --> 00:32:59.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But like we just read about,

00:32:59.694 --> 00:33:01.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s some fruitage in your life
that’s missing.”

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she responded,

00:33:04.465 --> 00:33:06.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I think it’s all in Jehovah’s time.”

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:10.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said,
“Jehovah has already invited you personally,

00:33:10.004 --> 00:33:12.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
so it’s really up to you now.”

00:33:12.006 --> 00:33:14.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she kept saying, “Well, to me,

00:33:14.375 --> 00:33:17.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’ll happen in Jehovah’s time.”

00:33:17.879 --> 00:33:19.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,

00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:21.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seemed better to discontinue the study

00:33:21.883 --> 00:33:25.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she showed that she didn’t feel
the need to make progress.

00:33:26.587 --> 00:33:29.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
This article was a present from Jehovah.

00:33:29.657 --> 00:33:32.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like everything that was important

00:33:32.393 --> 00:33:34.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
came all together in just one article.

00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:37.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re living in urgent times,

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:40.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we need to be as efficient as possible.

00:33:40.368 --> 00:33:42.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual progress a person makes,

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
which may have taken five years,
can take place now.

00:33:57.151 --> 00:34:00.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re currently conducting a Bible study,

00:34:00.054 --> 00:34:03.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you see any points
you could put into practice?

00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:05.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you starting each study with prayer

00:34:05.727 --> 00:34:08.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and teaching your student how to pray?

00:34:08.696 --> 00:34:12.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you regularly inviting others
to join you on the study?

00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:14.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
And are you skillfully using questions

00:34:14.569 --> 00:34:17.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find out what’s really
on your student’s mind?

00:34:17.905 --> 00:34:21.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
The art of using questions
is the topic of our next video in the series

00:34:21.876 --> 00:34:23.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.” </i>

00:34:25.146 --> 00:34:27.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi. I’m Armando.

00:34:27.181 --> 00:34:29.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.” </i>

00:34:38.526 --> 00:34:40.561 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’ve all been there.

00:34:40.561 --> 00:34:42.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re out in the ministry

00:34:42.563 --> 00:34:45.066 line:10% position:50% align:center
trying to start conversations with people.

00:34:46.234 --> 00:34:50.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for many of us, it’s not that easy.

00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:53.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just the idea of talking to a stranger

00:34:53.775 --> 00:34:57.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be intimidating.

00:34:57.044 --> 00:35:00.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, I’m not someone who finds it easy

00:35:00.248 --> 00:35:03.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just walk up to a stranger
and start a conversation.

00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:08.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with some effort and time,

00:35:08.422 --> 00:35:12.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned a few methods
that have helped me to overcome my fears.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we’re going to concentrate
on just one of them:

00:35:16.564 --> 00:35:19.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
using questions to start

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:22.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain a conversation.

00:35:22.303 --> 00:35:26.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps by the time we’re done,
you’ll realize like I have

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:28.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s not as difficult as it seems.

00:35:31.412 --> 00:35:32.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, there.

00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:35.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, well, we’re asking
our neighbors a question,

00:35:35.817 --> 00:35:38.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’d like to know your opinion.

00:35:38.786 --> 00:35:43.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever asked yourself
what we need to do to have a happy family?

00:35:43.791 --> 00:35:45.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
No. I’m not married.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, ah, OK.

00:35:48.462 --> 00:35:51.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have this brochure
that talks about . . .

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, three things:

00:35:55.736 --> 00:35:58.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the brother was nervous.

00:35:58.606 --> 00:36:03.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re nervous, we make
the person we’re speaking with nervous too.

00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:06.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, it’s difficult not to be nervous,

00:36:06.681 --> 00:36:11.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if we concentrate too much
on how we feel,

00:36:11.152 --> 00:36:13.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can forget that what we want to do

00:36:13.454 --> 00:36:16.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
is simply to start a conversation.

00:36:16.023 --> 00:36:19.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no pressure; just keep it casual.

00:36:20.695 --> 00:36:25.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, yes, the brother did ask a question,

00:36:25.533 --> 00:36:28.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the question was irrelevant
to the householder.

00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:32.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s usually better to ask something

00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:35.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will encourage the person
to participate in the conversation

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
but will also help us to discern
what interests them.

00:36:40.715 --> 00:36:45.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, one of the biggest fears we have is,

00:36:45.052 --> 00:36:47.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if my question
doesn’t connect with them?

00:36:47.822 --> 00:36:49.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can throw us off.

00:36:49.824 --> 00:36:52.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel like we have nowhere to go.

00:36:52.693 --> 00:36:55.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would have been better
to have a flexible approach

00:36:55.963 --> 00:36:59.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would allow us to react
according to what the person says.

00:37:00.568 --> 00:37:03.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s try it again,

00:37:03.004 --> 00:37:07.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this time let’s approach the situation
a little differently.

00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:09.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first few pages of our Bible,

00:37:09.877 --> 00:37:14.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are 20 questions
that we can use in the ministry.

00:37:14.215 --> 00:37:17.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not start familiarizing ourselves
with them?

00:37:17.718 --> 00:37:20.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can choose
one or two subjects that we like

00:37:20.254 --> 00:37:23.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we will be ready
when an opportunity arises.

00:37:23.891 --> 00:37:26.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how our brother does this
in the next demonstration.

00:37:28.562 --> 00:37:29.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, there.

00:37:29.597 --> 00:37:33.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re asking our neighbors a question,
and we’d love to know your opinion.

00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:38.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you say is something
that causes you a lot of stress?

00:37:38.072 --> 00:37:42.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, I worry a lot about money
and paying all my bills.

00:37:42.843 --> 00:37:46.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think that’s the case for many of us.

00:37:46.013 --> 00:37:48.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know
that the Bible explains something

00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:51.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help us specifically
with that anxiety?

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:53.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:37:53.187 --> 00:37:57.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the front of my Bible,
there are 20 questions that many of us ask

00:37:57.558 --> 00:37:59.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the Bible answers.

00:37:59.593 --> 00:38:02.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice question 16,

00:38:02.363 --> 00:38:04.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How can you cope with anxiety?”

00:38:06.434 --> 00:38:10.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what this scripture says
in Proverbs 21:5:

00:38:10.271 --> 00:38:11.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The plans of the diligent . . .”

00:38:13.274 --> 00:38:15.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Much better, right?

00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:18.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that when the person answered,

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:21.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother simply opened his Bible
to the questions

00:38:21.482 --> 00:38:25.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and found a scripture that allowed him
to continue the conversation?

00:38:25.786 --> 00:38:28.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he didn’t try to hide what he was doing.

00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:31.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed the person the tool he was using.

00:38:31.759 --> 00:38:35.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felt confident
that however the person responded,

00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:37.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would be able to find a useful scripture

00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:39.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would keep the conversation moving.

00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:42.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that went pretty well,

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maybe you’re thinking,

00:38:45.639 --> 00:38:48.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It almost never happens like that for me.’

00:38:49.777 --> 00:38:53.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps in our case,

00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:55.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s more like this.

00:38:57.318 --> 00:38:58.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, there.

00:38:58.452 --> 00:39:02.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re asking our neighbors a question,
and we’d love to know your opinion.

00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:06.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you say is something
that causes you a lot of stress?

00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:10.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
People coming to my door
and asking me questions.

00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:12.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:39:12.033 --> 00:39:14.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not a fan of that myself.

00:39:14.335 --> 00:39:17.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you ever wondered why we do this?

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at this point, the householder
may shut down the conversation completely.

00:39:23.811 --> 00:39:27.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s fine. We’re not trying to pressure
anyone into talking.

00:39:27.848 --> 00:39:31.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that second question
that the publisher asked

00:39:31.185 --> 00:39:34.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fact that he was calm,
that he was relaxed,

00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:37.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he was not taking himself
too seriously

00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:41.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of that can open the door
for the conversation to continue.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
To sum up, remember:

00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:50.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, be calm and relaxed.

00:39:50.371 --> 00:39:53.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re just trying to start a conversation.

00:39:53.541 --> 00:39:56.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Smile; be friendly.

00:39:57.044 --> 00:40:02.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, ask a question
that brings a person into the conversation

00:40:02.049 --> 00:40:05.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allows us to discover
what interests them.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, don’t be nervous
about where the conversation could lead.

00:40:12.526 --> 00:40:15.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our 20 questions for the ministry,

00:40:15.563 --> 00:40:18.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be sure
that we’ll find an appropriate text

00:40:18.899 --> 00:40:22.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will keep the conversation
directed toward spiritual matters.

00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:27.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is one of the methods
that has helped me,

00:40:27.174 --> 00:40:30.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I hope that it can help you too

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:34.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you see for yourself
how “iron sharpens iron.”

00:40:35.649 --> 00:40:38.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you sometimes feel like Brother Pérez

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find that it isn’t so easy
to walk up to a stranger

00:40:41.622 --> 00:40:44.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start a conversation?

00:40:44.225 --> 00:40:46.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using the questions in the front of our Bible

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be just what you need
to help get a conversation going.

00:40:51.098 --> 00:40:55.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, making disciples
takes more than technical teaching skill.

00:40:55.436 --> 00:40:59.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
First and foremost,
we have to love people,

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of their race,
background, or lifestyle.

00:41:03.277 --> 00:41:05.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is impartial,

00:41:05.279 --> 00:41:09.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have to be the same way
as we search out deserving ones.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the topic
of a recent morning worship

00:41:12.019 --> 00:41:14.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Brother William Turner.

00:41:14.155 --> 00:41:19.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
His talk highlights the many ways
we need to imitate Jehovah’s impartiality

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just in our ministry
but at all times.

00:41:23.998 --> 00:41:25.032 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, today’s text comments mention

00:41:25.032 --> 00:41:26.700 line:10% position:50% align:center
the effect that prejudice

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.969 line:10% position:50% align:center
had on Jesus’ disciples.

00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:31.071 line:10% position:50% align:center
And as we think about that today

00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:33.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
and how we are part of an organization

00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:34.875 line:10% position:50% align:center
that is much more diverse

00:41:34.875 --> 00:41:36.644 line:10% position:50% align:center
than in the first century,

00:41:36.644 --> 00:41:38.646 line:10% position:50% align:center
it raises the question,

00:41:38.646 --> 00:41:42.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does prejudice still have an impact
on God’s people today?

00:41:44.318 --> 00:41:47.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very thankful
that we love and serve a God

00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:50.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
who does not tolerate prejudice.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible states that quite plainly.

00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:54.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Acts,

00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:00.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we note the words
of the apostle Peter in Acts chapter 10.

00:42:02.803 --> 00:42:04.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 34, it says:

00:42:04.805 --> 00:42:08.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this Peter began to speak, and he said:

00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:10.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now I truly understand

00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:13.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that God is not partial,

00:42:13.981 --> 00:42:16.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but in every nation

00:42:16.183 --> 00:42:19.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the man who fears him
and does what is right

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
is acceptable to him.’”

00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:23.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you look at the study note,

00:42:23.657 --> 00:42:28.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
it mentions that the Greek phrase
for “is not partial”

00:42:28.262 --> 00:42:33.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally means “is not one who takes faces.”

00:42:33.267 --> 00:42:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that perfectly
describes Jehovah, doesn’t it?

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:41.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not favor one face, one individual,

00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:45.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
over another
because of their race, nationality,

00:42:45.045 --> 00:42:48.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
social standing,
or any other external factors.

00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:51.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s how
you and I strive to be as well.

00:42:53.153 --> 00:42:58.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we must acknowledge
that it is a challenge to be impartial,

00:42:58.158 --> 00:43:00.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
largely because in today’s world

00:43:00.694 --> 00:43:04.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are surrounded by prejudice.

00:43:04.298 --> 00:43:05.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to answer that question:

00:43:05.966 --> 00:43:08.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does prejudice have an impact
on God’s people today?

00:43:08.535 --> 00:43:10.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
—indeed, it does.

00:43:10.537 --> 00:43:12.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may be victims of it,

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:16.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we ourselves might hold some prejudice.

00:43:17.144 --> 00:43:20.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, <i>The Watchtower</i>  back in 2013

00:43:20.614 --> 00:43:23.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
made this comment, it said:

00:43:23.117 --> 00:43:25.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If we are honest with ourselves,

00:43:25.552 --> 00:43:28.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have to admit that deep down

00:43:28.389 --> 00:43:33.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we all harbor varying degrees of prejudice

00:43:33.193 --> 00:43:35.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
in one form or another.”

00:43:36.163 --> 00:43:40.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if this is something
that is a human tendency

00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:44.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re all plagued with it,
at least to some degree,

00:43:44.238 --> 00:43:46.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
then how do we overcome it?

00:43:47.207 --> 00:43:50.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it might be helpful
to start with the word itself.

00:43:50.944 --> 00:43:53.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Sister Leithiser mentioned,
the dictionary defines prejudice

00:43:53.981 --> 00:43:56.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “a preconceived opinion

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:01.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is not based
on reason or actual experience.”

00:44:02.423 --> 00:44:04.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
A preconceived opinion

00:44:05.793 --> 00:44:10.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to do with how we think and how we feel

00:44:10.798 --> 00:44:15.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
—thoughts that likely
have been shaped by our personal experiences,

00:44:15.002 --> 00:44:18.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
our upbringing, and our environment.

00:44:18.706 --> 00:44:20.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe when we think of prejudice,

00:44:20.908 --> 00:44:25.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps our minds
go to or we focus on racial prejudice

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hatred or animosity toward someone.

00:44:27.614 --> 00:44:30.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked a little bit about that last week.

00:44:30.351 --> 00:44:33.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
But <i>The Watchtower</i>
also mentioned that prejudices

00:44:33.821 --> 00:44:38.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also be formed against
another person because of their weight,

00:44:38.292 --> 00:44:42.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
gender, language, social status,

00:44:42.596 --> 00:44:47.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
religion, or virtually
any perceived difference.

00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:51.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if prejudice starts with our personality

00:44:51.505 --> 00:44:55.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
or our personal preconceived opinions,

00:44:55.075 --> 00:44:57.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the way to overcome it

00:44:57.678 --> 00:45:00.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to start by elevating our minds

00:45:00.881 --> 00:45:03.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
to God’s way of thinking.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:07.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, if we go back to the Bible,
this time to 1 Samuel chapter 16,

00:45:09.923 --> 00:45:14.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how Jehovah
brings this to light—1 Samuel chapter 16.

00:45:14.328 --> 00:45:18.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s recall what happens
when Samuel goes to the house of Jesse

00:45:18.198 --> 00:45:21.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
to appoint one of his sons as king.

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:24.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 6 says:

00:45:24.238 --> 00:45:27.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they came in and he saw Eliab, he said:

00:45:27.574 --> 00:45:31.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Surely here before Jehovah
stands his anointed one.’

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Jehovah said to Samuel:

00:45:35.516 --> 00:45:39.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not pay attention
to his appearance and how tall he is,

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
for I have rejected him.’”

00:45:42.456 --> 00:45:46.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we stop there for a moment,
did you notice what Samuel did?

00:45:46.493 --> 00:45:48.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this particular instance,

00:45:48.729 --> 00:45:51.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was as that Greek phrase denoted,

00:45:51.899 --> 00:45:54.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a taker of faces,” wasn’t he?

00:45:54.535 --> 00:45:57.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
He looked at Eliab;
he saw how tall and how handsome he looked.

00:45:57.304 --> 00:46:00.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Surely, this must be Jehovah’s choice.

00:46:00.207 --> 00:46:02.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
But note how the verse continues;
note the teaching point:

00:46:04.545 --> 00:46:08.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For the way man
sees is not the way God sees,

00:46:08.882 --> 00:46:12.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because mere man
sees what appears to the eyes,

00:46:12.586 --> 00:46:15.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”

00:46:17.157 --> 00:46:19.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what matters to Jehovah

00:46:19.159 --> 00:46:22.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what’s in our heart,
what we are on the inside.

00:46:22.396 --> 00:46:26.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s looking
for those qualities in each of us

00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:28.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reflect his impartiality.

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:34.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how is this of benefit to us, 
since you and I cannot read hearts?

00:46:34.074 --> 00:46:36.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back to the study note.

00:46:36.777 --> 00:46:40.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rest of the study note
for Acts 10:34 gives us the answer,

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it says:

00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:44.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Imitating God’s impartiality means,

00:46:44.852 --> 00:46:48.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not making surface judgments,

00:46:48.422 --> 00:46:53.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
but paying attention
to the character and qualities of others.”

00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:58.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, perhaps one way we can illustrate this
is with the example of a geode.

00:46:58.866 --> 00:47:00.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, look at this picture.

00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:02.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
On its outside surface,

00:47:02.903 --> 00:47:06.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
a geode looks pretty ordinary and nondescript

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:10.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no different than any big rock
or stone you’d find outside.

00:47:10.844 --> 00:47:12.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you break it open,

00:47:13.347 --> 00:47:15.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
ah, quite a different story.

00:47:15.482 --> 00:47:17.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you look inside,

00:47:17.484 --> 00:47:21.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see these beautiful
sparkling crystals of varying colors

00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:25.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are just quite beautiful
and really radiant to the eye.

00:47:26.627 --> 00:47:28.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s our point?

00:47:29.229 --> 00:47:32.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we make surface judgments

00:47:32.799 --> 00:47:36.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
or preconceived opinions about our brothers,

00:47:36.203 --> 00:47:40.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
often aren’t we looking at them
like the outside of that geode?

00:47:40.574 --> 00:47:43.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
All that we see is just the external surface.

00:47:44.845 --> 00:47:48.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it so true
that perhaps if someone is shy,

00:47:48.282 --> 00:47:50.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
quiet, or reserved,

00:47:50.884 --> 00:47:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s so easy to label them, isn’t it?

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
We sized them up,
and we quickly come to the conclusion:

00:47:55.322 --> 00:47:57.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ah, you know what, there’s not much there.

00:47:57.724 --> 00:48:00.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really don’t have much to offer.”

00:48:00.427 --> 00:48:04.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or it could be that the person is very
talkative, loud, extroverted—same thing.

00:48:04.932 --> 00:48:06.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
We label them and form an opinion.

00:48:06.934 --> 00:48:10.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could it be in those
particular instances that we have become

00:48:10.237 --> 00:48:12.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a taker of faces”?

00:48:12.272 --> 00:48:16.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve made a judgment
purely based on personal opinion

00:48:16.209 --> 00:48:19.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what we feel is acceptable.

00:48:20.047 --> 00:48:23.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to imitate Jehovah’s way of thinking,

00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:26.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to go beyond the surface;

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to focus on the character
and the qualities of our brothers,

00:48:31.725 --> 00:48:35.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with some people that may take time.

00:48:35.395 --> 00:48:38.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, with the geode, one expert stated:

00:48:38.298 --> 00:48:41.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There are many
different ways to open a geode.

00:48:41.635 --> 00:48:44.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But no matter how you do it,

00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:49.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
the key is patience, patience, patience.”

00:48:50.377 --> 00:48:53.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it true
that it’s the same with our brothers?

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes time and patience
to get to know them,

00:48:56.483 --> 00:49:00.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
time and patience
to understand the way that they think,

00:49:00.187 --> 00:49:03.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show personal interest
by asking questions,

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:08.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work with them in the ministry,
and to consider their suggestions.

00:49:08.128 --> 00:49:11.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we do, well, we’re rewarded.

00:49:11.999 --> 00:49:14.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
We begin to see the crystals;

00:49:14.101 --> 00:49:18.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
we begin to see their inner beauty inside;

00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:21.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
we discover true depth
in our brothers and sisters,

00:49:21.274 --> 00:49:23.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hopefully they do in us as well.

00:49:24.945 --> 00:49:26.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, going back to Jesus’ disciples,

00:49:26.947 --> 00:49:29.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
while the Bible candidly details

00:49:29.383 --> 00:49:32.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
a number of accounts
showing their human traits

00:49:32.085 --> 00:49:34.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their prejudicial feelings at times,

00:49:34.755 --> 00:49:38.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
it also highlights
how they overcame those feelings.

00:49:38.992 --> 00:49:43.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just look at how much we read and meditate
on the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:49:43.964 --> 00:49:48.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how much those verses
and books emphasize love,

00:49:48.602 --> 00:49:50.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
opening our hearts, loving our brothers,

00:49:50.937 --> 00:49:54.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting along with one another,
and widening out.

00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:58.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples did not allow
any deep-rooted feelings

00:49:58.311 --> 00:50:03.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
or things from their upbringing
or their environment to control them.

00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:07.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you and I can be the same.

00:50:07.654 --> 00:50:12.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it all starts
with an honest self-examination:

00:50:12.192 --> 00:50:16.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Can I identify any traces
of prejudice within me?’

00:50:17.898 --> 00:50:22.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we can, well,
it all starts with our thinking

00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:27.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
—elevating our thinking
to Jehovah’s way of thinking.

00:50:27.174 --> 00:50:31.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s avoid surface judgments,
being “a taker of faces.”

00:50:31.478 --> 00:50:33.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take the time
to get to know our brothers

00:50:33.647 --> 00:50:36.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciate their character and qualities

00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:38.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their inner beauty.

00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:42.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus told his disciples at Matthew 23:8:

00:50:42.189 --> 00:50:44.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All of you are brothers.”

00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:47.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what made them brothers?

00:50:47.027 --> 00:50:49.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 12:50, Jesus said:

00:50:49.162 --> 00:50:52.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For whoever does the will of my Father . . . ,

00:50:52.532 --> 00:50:55.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that one is my brother

00:50:55.168 --> 00:50:57.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sister and mother.”

00:50:58.438 --> 00:51:00.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a nice reminder, isn’t it?

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are all part of a large spiritual family

00:51:03.376 --> 00:51:06.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
united by our faith and love for God.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we see each other that way,

00:51:08.949 --> 00:51:11.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us to remain humble

00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:15.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
and recognize that we have no reason
to elevate ourselves above others.

00:51:15.722 --> 00:51:20.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we’re going to be filled
with so much love and appreciation

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be part of this organization

00:51:22.262 --> 00:51:26.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we imitate our impartial God
and Father, Jehovah.

00:51:27.634 --> 00:51:32.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
With prejudice and discrimination
so rampant in the world around us,

00:51:32.439 --> 00:51:35.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
those reminders couldn’t be more timely.

00:51:36.676 --> 00:51:39.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve been talking a lot
during this broadcast

00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:42.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
about helping our students
become disciples.

00:51:42.983 --> 00:51:44.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those of you who are parents,

00:51:44.651 --> 00:51:48.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
your most precious students are,
of course, your own children.

00:51:48.655 --> 00:51:51.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
As teachers,
we have to help them prepare

00:51:51.925 --> 00:51:54.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the pressures they’ll face in school.

00:51:54.327 --> 00:51:58.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those pressures
are more intense now than ever

00:51:58.031 --> 00:52:02.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
—especially when it comes
to sexual immorality.

00:52:02.102 --> 00:52:06.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this episode of <i>My Teen Life,</i>
we’ll hear from two young people

00:52:06.039 --> 00:52:10.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
who successfully resisted
the temptations to have sex.

00:52:10.644 --> 00:52:12.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they do it?

00:52:19.152 --> 00:52:21.154 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, every day in high school,

00:52:21.154 --> 00:52:23.356 line:10% position:50% align:center
my classmates would talk about sex.

00:52:23.356 --> 00:52:25.392 line:10% position:50% align:center
They would just talk about, you know,

00:52:25.392 --> 00:52:27.093 line:10% position:50% align:center
their boyfriends and girlfriends

00:52:27.093 --> 00:52:30.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what they did with them,
you know, over the weekend

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:31.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they’re going to do.

00:52:31.565 --> 00:52:34.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
They, of course, knew
that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:52:34.034 --> 00:52:36.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I wouldn’t engage in premarital sex,

00:52:36.203 --> 00:52:38.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that did not stop them from pushing.

00:52:38.505 --> 00:52:41.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guys would invade my personal space.

00:52:41.274 --> 00:52:43.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes they would even try

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
to, you know, grab or touch me.

00:52:45.879 --> 00:52:50.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, a girl in class asked me
to touch her inappropriately.

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:52.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, I rejected her,

00:52:52.352 --> 00:52:55.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she even started
or resorted to calling me names.

00:52:55.021 --> 00:52:58.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
She called me lame,
and she said that I must be gay.

00:52:58.391 --> 00:53:02.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seemed to be a game to them
to try to break me

00:53:02.696 --> 00:53:05.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and try to get me
to do things with them.

00:53:05.298 --> 00:53:07.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact that I wouldn’t give in,

00:53:07.868 --> 00:53:10.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
they thought it was fun or funny.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:13.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
It got to the point
where this became very physical.

00:53:13.373 --> 00:53:16.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had two classmates
behind me that were pushing me.

00:53:16.209 --> 00:53:19.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
One classmate on each side of me
was grabbing my arms

00:53:19.112 --> 00:53:21.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pushing me,
trying to make me touch her.

00:53:21.047 --> 00:53:24.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that it was time to get out of there.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:29.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was already very different in school,

00:53:29.422 --> 00:53:32.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I was also very shy.

00:53:32.626 --> 00:53:35.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at times, I wanted to fit in

00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:39.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the crowd so that I wouldn’t have
that attention on me.

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I knew that this would displease Jehovah

00:53:42.235 --> 00:53:46.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
if I, you know, went with the crowd
and did what the other kids were doing.

00:53:46.139 --> 00:53:48.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I did say a quick,
silent prayer to Jehovah;

00:53:48.742 --> 00:53:50.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Jehovah, just please help me.”

00:53:50.343 --> 00:53:52.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
I immediately in my mind thought of Joseph.

00:53:52.946 --> 00:53:56.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was able to free himself
from Potiphar’s wife,

00:53:56.583 --> 00:54:00.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was able to get away
because of his resolve to please Jehovah.

00:54:00.253 --> 00:54:02.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly
what I knew I needed to do.

00:54:02.822 --> 00:54:06.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I did just that
—I ran right out of the classroom.

00:54:06.359 --> 00:54:10.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personal study was very important.

00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:12.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made Jehovah really real to me.

00:54:12.699 --> 00:54:14.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more real he was to me,

00:54:14.768 --> 00:54:18.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more I didn’t want
to displease him and hurt him.

00:54:18.872 --> 00:54:22.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having that relationship with him
and having that trust in him

00:54:22.275 --> 00:54:25.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
really helped me get through those situations

00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:28.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
of wanting to fit in
and going with the crowd.

00:54:28.615 --> 00:54:31.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rejecting that girl was not easy,

00:54:31.518 --> 00:54:33.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I did know
that it was the right thing to do.

00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:35.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly before this incident,

00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:37.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
my grandmother actually prepared me.

00:54:37.724 --> 00:54:40.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
She would prepare <i>Watchtower</i>  articles for me

00:54:40.293 --> 00:54:43.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
that talked about
how to deal with temptation.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:47.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although those talks with her
were super-duper awkward,

00:54:47.167 --> 00:54:49.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
if I’m being honest, they really helped me

00:54:49.736 --> 00:54:52.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay spiritually strong
and to resist the temptation.

00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:57.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents always told me
to use farsighted wisdom

00:54:57.344 --> 00:55:02.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to think about how
that action would affect me

00:55:02.315 --> 00:55:06.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the future,
affect my relationship with Jehovah

00:55:06.152 --> 00:55:08.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with my friends and my family.

00:55:08.254 --> 00:55:12.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
That definitely went
through my head a lot during that time.

00:55:12.192 --> 00:55:15.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
All you need to do is trust in Jehovah,

00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:17.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if you trust in him,

00:55:17.263 --> 00:55:20.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
then everything is going to be OK.

00:55:20.066 --> 00:55:22.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
The publication
that really helped me the most

00:55:22.869 --> 00:55:25.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the <i>Young People Ask</i>  book, Volume 2,

00:55:25.538 --> 00:55:28.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 5, “Why Stay a Virgin?”

00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:31.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
This book was really a lifesaver for me.

00:55:31.611 --> 00:55:35.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading about how some
of my peers all around the world

00:55:35.048 --> 00:55:37.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
are dealing with the exact same temptation

00:55:37.517 --> 00:55:39.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
really gave me a sense of comfort

00:55:39.519 --> 00:55:42.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped me to feel that I was not alone.

00:55:42.022 --> 00:55:46.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m really grateful
to Jehovah and the organization

00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:50.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the love that they show to us young ones

00:55:50.964 --> 00:55:54.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to help us not feel alone and to help us

00:55:54.134 --> 00:55:57.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
push through these difficult situations.

00:55:57.303 --> 00:55:59.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Young People Ask</i>  book, Volume 2,

00:55:59.873 --> 00:56:04.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 14,
“How Can I Protect Myself at School?”

00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:06.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
really encouraged me in school

00:56:06.546 --> 00:56:11.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be firm and to stand my ground
to make Jehovah happy.

00:56:12.118 --> 00:56:15.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m so thankful to Jehovah
for recalling scriptures

00:56:15.822 --> 00:56:18.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
like 1 Corinthians 6:18,

00:56:18.091 --> 00:56:20.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says: “Flee from sexual immorality!”

00:56:20.894 --> 00:56:23.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m happy to say
that I was able to do just that.

00:56:23.763 --> 00:56:25.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, really, what makes me the happiest

00:56:25.899 --> 00:56:27.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
is knowing that I made Jehovah happy,

00:56:27.934 --> 00:56:30.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there is no greater feeling than that.

00:56:48.021 --> 00:56:52.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that many of you young ones
are just like Kamryn and Cory,

00:56:52.025 --> 00:56:56.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re so proud of you
for the courageous stand you take every day.

00:56:56.663 --> 00:56:58.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know it isn’t easy,

00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:01.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
but remember,
when you take that stand,

00:57:01.167 --> 00:57:03.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re making Jehovah’s heart glad.

00:57:04.904 --> 00:57:06.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes courage to be different.

00:57:06.906 --> 00:57:08.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
For many of our brothers and sisters

00:57:08.908 --> 00:57:11.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
that courage is being tested
in a special way.

00:57:11.644 --> 00:57:13.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re preaching and making disciples

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:18.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
in lands where the work
is restricted or under ban.

00:57:18.284 --> 00:57:20.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do they muster the courage

00:57:20.453 --> 00:57:23.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep on preaching despite opposition?

00:57:23.823 --> 00:57:27.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the theme
of this month’s new music video.

00:57:35.702 --> 00:57:49.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
I woke up this morning and dressed for the day.
I prayed to Jehovah and went on my way.

00:57:49.249 --> 00:58:02.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was told not to preach, but I cannot bend.
God is my Ruler rather than men.

00:58:02.929 --> 00:58:12.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like the breeze blowing out in the field,
I feel peace right here.

00:58:12.005 --> 00:58:19.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know Jehovah’s with me,
so why should I fear?

00:58:19.946 --> 00:58:25.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know Jehovah’s with me,
so why should I fear?

00:58:27.554 --> 00:58:41.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I get back home and think about this day,
That man on the bench had so much to say.

00:58:41.367 --> 00:58:54.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I pray that I’ll see him again there soon.
I know he’d feel better if he had the truth.

00:58:54.847 --> 00:59:03.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like the breeze blowing out in the field,
I feel peace right here.

00:59:03.823 --> 00:59:11.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know Jehovah’s with me,
so why should I fear?

00:59:11.965 --> 00:59:18.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know Jehovah’s with me,
so why should I fear?

00:59:19.472 --> 00:59:28.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a fire that’s burning deep in my heart,
These words I will speak; I’ll do my part.

00:59:28.047 --> 00:59:36.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll spread his name the best that I can,
And I will keep going right down to the end.

00:59:36.022 --> 00:59:43.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing my brothers are fighting this fight,
I’ll strengthen my faith, keep it alive.

00:59:43.496 --> 00:59:52.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting Jehovah, his praises I’ll sing,
Knowing the new world he soon will bring.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:58.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I lay my head down to sleep tonight,
I thank Jehovah and turn out the light.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:12.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
What tomorrow may bring, I do not know,
But I know that I won’t face it alone.

01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:21.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like the breeze blowing out in the field,
I feel peace right here.

01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:29.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know Jehovah’s with me,
so why should I fear?

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:36.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know Jehovah’s with me,
so I will not fear.

01:01:41.013 --> 01:01:43.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the young brother
portrayed in our video,

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:47.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can gain confidence,
knowing that when we’re in the ministry,

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is with us every step of the way.

01:01:51.724 --> 01:01:53.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our program has shown us the many ways

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:56.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has equipped us to make disciples

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving us the best tools

01:01:58.398 --> 01:02:00.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the best training.

01:02:01.401 --> 01:02:04.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being a disciple-maker
also means being courageous

01:02:04.237 --> 01:02:07.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to taking a stand
for our moral principles

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:10.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and preaching even when opposed.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know Jehovah will bless all your hard work

01:02:12.945 --> 01:02:15.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you go on making disciples.

01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:19.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
One part of the world
where the disciple-making work

01:02:19.685 --> 01:02:22.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been thriving
for well over 100 years

01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:25.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Australia, our destination

01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:27.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this month’s video postcard.

01:02:29.195 --> 01:02:31.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Australia is a vast island continent

01:02:31.764 --> 01:02:34.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
four times larger
than the largest island in the world.

01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:38.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Situated between the Indian
and Pacific oceans,

01:02:38.738 --> 01:02:42.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Australia is a land of dramatic contrasts.

01:02:42.141 --> 01:02:46.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the second driest continent
after Antarctica,

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
with vast deserts.

01:02:48.147 --> 01:02:51.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, some of its mountain ranges
receive enough snow

01:02:51.284 --> 01:02:54.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have earned the name the Australian Alps!

01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:58.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Off the coast of Queensland in the northeast,

01:02:58.491 --> 01:03:00.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll find the Great Barrier Reef,

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the largest coral reef system
on earth!

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:06.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether you’re traveling
in Australia’s dusty outback

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:09.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
or along the coast,

01:03:09.068 --> 01:03:11.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll likely see many kangaroos.

01:03:11.237 --> 01:03:13.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not surprising because there are

01:03:13.739 --> 01:03:17.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
many more kangaroos in Australia
than there are people.

01:03:17.243 --> 01:03:20.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kangaroos are native to Australia,
as are many other animals,

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:22.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the koala,

01:03:22.648 --> 01:03:24.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
wombat,

01:03:24.617 --> 01:03:26.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
possum,

01:03:26.519 --> 01:03:28.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
emu,

01:03:29.255 --> 01:03:31.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the unique duck-billed platypus.

01:03:32.492 --> 01:03:34.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeds of truth reached Australia

01:03:34.594 --> 01:03:37.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far back as 1884.

01:03:37.463 --> 01:03:40.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Australia branch was established in 1904,

01:03:40.867 --> 01:03:43.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
making it one of the oldest branches
in the world.

01:03:43.469 --> 01:03:46.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today it’s called the Australasia branch

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and oversees the preaching

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just in Australia and New Zealand

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in many islands of the South Pacific.

01:03:54.413 --> 01:03:56.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the early days,

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:58.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers covered the vast Australian territory

01:03:58.284 --> 01:04:02.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveling by bicycle, truck, cart,

01:04:02.021 --> 01:04:04.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even camel.

01:04:05.858 --> 01:04:10.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, more than 70,400 publishers
and 7,500 pioneers

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:13.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
are preaching
in almost 40 different languages.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
A special effort is made to reach

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Australia’s native Aboriginal people.

01:04:18.905 --> 01:04:20.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
To assist those hungering for the truth,

01:04:20.907 --> 01:04:25.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
literature has been translated
into some of the indigenous languages.

01:04:26.712 --> 01:04:29.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Australian brothers and sisters
have also found success

01:04:29.682 --> 01:04:34.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaching on passenger trains
and at railway stations.

01:04:34.053 --> 01:04:36.422 line:10% position:50% align:center
This is the Broken Hill Station,

01:04:36.422 --> 01:04:39.292 line:10% position:50% align:center
a stop on the <i>Indian Pacific</i>  route,

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:42.128 line:10% position:50% align:center
which runs more than 4,300 kilometers,

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:45.965 line:10% position:50% align:center
or about 2,700 miles, from Sydney to Perth.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:47.667 line:10% position:50% align:center
Many have learned the truth

01:04:47.667 --> 01:04:49.168 line:10% position:50% align:center
as a result of the preaching

01:04:49.168 --> 01:04:51.170 line:10% position:50% align:center
along this train line.

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:54.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of Australia’s nearly
26 million inhabitants

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
live in cities and towns
not far from the coast.

01:04:57.677 --> 01:04:59.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those towns is Nowra,

01:04:59.679 --> 01:05:02.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
home of the Nowra-West Congregation.

01:05:03.282 --> 01:05:05.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a little help from Zoom,

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
the 80 brothers and sisters

01:05:06.786 --> 01:05:08.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Nowra-West Congregation

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:11.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you their warmest love.

01:05:12.224 --> 01:05:15.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the world headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:05:15.027 --> 01:05:17.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
