00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:07.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greetings, and welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are a few highlights
from this month’s program.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:16.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuele was torn
between his career and the truth.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he resolve this conflict,

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:21.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what steps did he take
to reach his spiritual goals?

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you’ve been impatient with someone

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:29.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they’re not handling
a situation the way you would.

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:31.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a new dramatization,

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:35.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neeta and Jade
learn how to cultivate patience.

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:40.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this episode of <i>Our History in Motion,</i>

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:43.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see how conventions
strengthen the unity

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love among Jehovah’s people.

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:50.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for November 2022!

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our broadcast for this month,

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to discuss
the quality of patience.

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:19.262 line:10% position:50% align:center
Think of how many situations we encounter

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:21.765 line:10% position:50% align:center
that require patience:

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:24.100 line:10% position:50% align:center
waiting in rush-hour traffic,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with a difficult coworker,

00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:30.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
raising a child,
overcoming marital problems,

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:34.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
coping with the illness of a loved one,

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:36.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe coping with an illness of our own.

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:41.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, all of us face situations

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
that require us to display
a measure of patience each day.

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:51.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we don’t have patience,
we can become frustrated,

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
tired, and discouraged.

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:57.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no matter what our circumstances are,

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:00.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us can develop this quality.

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:02.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know?

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:06.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because according to Galatians 5:22,

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
patience is an aspect
of the fruitage of God’s spirit,

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:11.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with its help,

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:16.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can make this quality
an integral part of our personality.

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:22.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this to happen,
let’s now answer two important questions.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, How can being patient

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:28.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second, How can being patient improve

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
our relationship with others?

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:37.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start with our first question:

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can being patient
help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:47.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider what is stated
in 1 Corinthians chapter 13.

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:52.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
This chapter gives us a description
of how love manifests itself.

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:55.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along as I read verse 4:

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is patient and kind.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is not jealous.

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:04.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not brag, does not get puffed up.”

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of all the many qualities
that stem from love,

00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:10.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you note which one is listed first?

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:13.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Patience.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is an integral aspect of love.

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:21.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need both love and patience
in order to be successful

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:25.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ensure we’re on the right course,
which includes pleasing Jehovah.

00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:32.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we think of situations
where a lack of patience was a factor,

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:37.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can usually identify
where a lack of love was evident.

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:43.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take, for example,
God’s chosen people, the nation of Israel.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Psalm 106,

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:48.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
written many years
after Israel’s deliverance from Egypt,

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:53.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
the psalmist indicates that they continued
acting with a similar disposition.

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:56.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite that,

00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:00.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah extended patience
to them for many years.

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:06.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along as I read Psalm 106:7, 8:

00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:09.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our forefathers in Egypt

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“did not appreciate your wonderful works.

00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:17.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They did not remember
your abundant loyal love,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they rebelled at the sea,
by the Red Sea.

00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:23.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he saved them for the sake of his name,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make his mightiness known.”

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:29.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what was the result?

00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verse 13:

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But they quickly forgot what he did;

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not wait for his counsel.”

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
How sad!

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:45.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people “did not wait.”

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were not patient.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that highlights
that they did not appreciate

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s patience and loyal love.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love for God should have caused them

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think about the consequences
of their actions.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should have remembered
how Jehovah cared and provided for them.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
That should have moved them to be patient

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wait on Jehovah’s direction.

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:11.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
But time and again,

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:16.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
their actions showed that they really didn’t
love Jehovah as they should have.

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it cost them.

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
They eventually tested
Jehovah’s patience to the limit

00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:25.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, as a nation, lost his favor.

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:28.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can you and I learn from their example?

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:32.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never would we want
to become independent of Jehovah,

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting in our own thinking

00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:37.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not patiently waiting
for Jehovah’s counsel

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
to direct the decisions we make.

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:44.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about how well we’ve been guided
recently regarding the pandemic,

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters,

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:50.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the organizing of our ministry.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we didn’t fully understand

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:57.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even fully agree with all the decisions,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love for God helped us to take the time

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:05.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think about Jehovah’s care for us
and trust him.

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so, we learn that if we’re patient

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:12.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
and submit to Jehovah’s direction,

00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:14.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t go off course

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll benefit ourselves and others.

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in doing so,

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:23.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
we ultimately express our love for Jehovah.

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:28.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now answer the second question:

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:33.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can being patient
improve our relationship with others?

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:37.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we go back to 1 Corinthians 13:4,

00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:39.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
the study note states:

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:43.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Patience is a quality that Jehovah and Jesus

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:46.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“constantly show
in their dealings with humans.

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:49.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As imitators of Jesus and Jehovah,

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians are to show patience to others.”

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Jehovah and Jesus are patient with us,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would follow that we imitate
their example and be patient with others.

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:07.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start 
with the greatest example, Jehovah.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the patience he’s shown

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:14.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
in waiting to bring an end to this system.

00:07:14.717 --> 00:07:19.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has a fixed day and hour
when that will take place,

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s patiently waiting
until that arrives.

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:26.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s bound himself to his own timetable.

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:28.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now rest assured,

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:32.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is well aware
of how we feel as his servants.

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:38.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that we wish the end of this system
to come as soon as possible

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:42.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we long
to see the fulfillment of all his promises.

00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he longs to fulfill them.

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:49.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he will not become impatient

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:52.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and act before his appointed time.

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should we appreciate
Jehovah’s patience in that regard?

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:02.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along as I read 2 Peter 3:15:

00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, consider the patience

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of our Lord as salvation,

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as our beloved brother Paul
also wrote you

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:16.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the wisdom given him.”

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a powerful point?

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:24.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s patience
is the means for our salvation.

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:30.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the number of people
who are learning the truth every year.

00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:32.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even during the pandemic,

00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:35.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we weren’t able to engage
in our typical house-to-house witnessing,

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:40.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
tens of thousands of individuals
still got baptized worldwide.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps some of those
included your Bible students,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
family members, close friends,

00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:51.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe even you yourself.

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:53.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about this:

00:08:53.349 --> 00:08:57.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah had impatiently
brought the end of this system

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:01.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
5, 10, or 20 years ago,

00:09:02.992 --> 00:09:05.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you have learned the truth?

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:08.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we appreciate that Jehovah

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:12.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
is still patiently waiting
for his day to arrive

00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:15.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has allowed
so many to attain to repentance

00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and develop a relationship with him.

00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:23.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should this affect
our relationship with others?

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:27.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps it can help us to be more patient
with a progressive Bible student

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
who still may be struggling with a problem.

00:09:30.386 --> 00:09:34.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe it’s still difficult
for some of our relatives to see us

00:09:34.123 --> 00:09:38.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
and to adjust to our beliefs and lifestyle.

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:43.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in imitation of Jehovah’s patience,

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t give up on them.

00:09:46.702 --> 00:09:50.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, reflecting
on Jehovah’s patience should move us

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:54.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue
to have a full share in the ministry,

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
earnestly looking for those who
are “rightly disposed for everlasting life”

00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:02.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helping them
to love Jehovah and serve him.

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:05.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they too can benefit
from Jehovah’s patience,

00:10:05.988 --> 00:10:08.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as we have.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also learn from the example of Jesus.

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:16.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
He demonstrated tremendous patience
when his disciples

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:20.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
were arguing among themselves
as to who was the greatest.

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
This apparently happened
on a number of occasions.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt,
it saddened Jesus to hear this.

00:10:27.576 --> 00:10:30.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus was patient with them.

00:10:30.813 --> 00:10:33.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed empathy for them.

00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:36.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew how much
the culture and the environment

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:40.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which they had been raised
affected their thinking and attitude.

00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:44.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
That knowledge caused him to react kindly.

00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:48.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note one beautiful example.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read with me Mark chapter 9

00:10:51.934 --> 00:10:56.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark 9:33, 35:

00:10:56.472 --> 00:10:59.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they came into Capernaum.

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:02.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now when he was inside the house,

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he put the question to them:

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What were you arguing about on the road?’”

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know the answer.

00:11:09.352 --> 00:11:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had been arguing
about who among them was the greater.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at verse 35:

00:11:16.392 --> 00:11:20.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he sat down
and called the Twelve and said to them:

00:11:20.162 --> 00:11:22.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If anyone wants to be first,

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:26.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
he must be last of all and minister of all.’”

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note what Jesus did?

00:11:30.339 --> 00:11:33.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
He patiently waited for the right time

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
to correct them kindly.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t make a scene on the road.

00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:40.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 33,

00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:44.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
he waited until “he was inside the house,”

00:11:44.553 --> 00:11:48.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 35, ‘sitting down.’

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
He calmed the situation.

00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:54.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t push them.

00:11:54.263 --> 00:11:58.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he led them patiently by instruction

00:11:58.701 --> 00:12:00.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by example.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great example
in avoiding becoming provoked

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, instead of acting immediately,

00:12:08.577 --> 00:12:12.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
waiting for the right time
to address matters,

00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:15.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when our patience is tested!

00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:21.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
What else can we take away
from Jesus’ example of patience?

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re a parent,

00:12:23.192 --> 00:12:26.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you imitate the way
that Jesus dealt with his apostles?

00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:31.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be frustrating if your children
don’t respond immediately to your counsel

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:34.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if they’re slow
in correcting their shortcomings.

00:12:34.703 --> 00:12:37.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps you’re an elder

00:12:37.406 --> 00:12:39.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and someone you’re trying to help may be slow

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
in responding to Bible-based counsel.

00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:45.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember Jesus’ example.

00:12:45.648 --> 00:12:48.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
He never gave up on his apostles.

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
He kept looking for the good,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressing confidence in them,

00:12:53.989 --> 00:12:57.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he patiently repeated lessons
that they needed

00:12:57.293 --> 00:12:59.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they could draw closer to Jehovah.

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:03.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do the same, not giving up,

00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:07.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
our patience may eventually
be rewarded as well.

00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:10.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to review:

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can being patient help us
to express our love for Jehovah?

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
It stops us from running ahead of Jehovah,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
demonstrating our loyal love for him.

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:23.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Waiting patiently
for Jehovah’s direction and guidance

00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
ensures that our course is pleasing to him.

00:13:28.023 --> 00:13:32.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second, How can being patient
improve our relationship with others?

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:36.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to avoid acting rashly

00:13:36.665 --> 00:13:38.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to look for the good in others

00:13:38.968 --> 00:13:41.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and express confidence in them.

00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:46.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hopefully, this discussion
will help us appreciate

00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:49.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
the benefit of displaying
patience in our lives.

00:13:49.945 --> 00:13:52.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the increasing pressures
of these last days,

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:55.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll need to display patience
more than ever before!

00:13:56.952 --> 00:13:59.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imitating the patience of Jehovah and Jesus

00:13:59.989 --> 00:14:02.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us keep the right attitude.

00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:05.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t become
overly discouraged or overwhelmed

00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:08.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the present wickedness in this system

00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:12.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even be impatient about when it will end.

00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:16.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we’ll stay on the right course:

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:21.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
keeping busy, working to develop
a closer relationship with Jehovah,

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keeping active in our ministry,

00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:25.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping others to learn about Jehovah

00:14:25.014 --> 00:14:27.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
and benefit from his patience.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all of us keep working

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:34.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the quality of patience
a dominant part of our personality.

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we do,

00:14:36.592 --> 00:14:41.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will demonstrate how much we value
and appreciate this wonderful quality

00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:44.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring all praise and honor to Jehovah!

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:49.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
To give Jehovah their best,

00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:53.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of our brothers
give up lucrative and prestigious careers.

00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:57.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making this decision
may take time and patience

00:14:57.746 --> 00:15:00.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ll see in our first video.

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:11.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
I played in the Series A,
which is the top league in Italy.

00:15:12.094 --> 00:15:14.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was on the National Youth Team,

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:19.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I went all the way up
to the Men’s National Team.

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:22.404 line:10% position:50% align:center
Just the fact that you are good

00:15:22.404 --> 00:15:24.673 line:10% position:50% align:center
at your job is gratifying,

00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:27.543 line:10% position:50% align:center
and then there is also the financial aspect.

00:15:29.912 --> 00:15:33.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom and dad were Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:15:33.248 --> 00:15:36.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so was my older brother.

00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:39.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
At a certain point,

00:15:39.054 --> 00:15:41.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt conflicted,

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:48.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when I decided
to draw closer to the truth.

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:52.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was no longer a “family” thing.

00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:55.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, something started to develop in me

00:15:55.638 --> 00:15:57.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a fire, a small fire.

00:15:57.673 --> 00:16:02.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gradually,
I came to the point of dedication to Jehovah,

00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:05.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
although I still played.

00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:09.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
But maybe
—not maybe, definitely—

00:16:09.918 --> 00:16:12.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t giving Jehovah my best, my energy.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was fitting my spiritual life
around my work life

00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:23.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the other way around.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
I excused myself, saying:

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:28.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m just working.

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s a profession.

00:16:32.107 --> 00:16:34.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, it’s time-consuming,

00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:39.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s of short duration
because athletes retire earlier.”

00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:46.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
The closer I drew to Jehovah,

00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:48.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
the stronger my inner conflicts became.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:59.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
The circuit overseer who served
the area I was associated with helped me.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had known him since I was a child.

00:17:05.507 --> 00:17:09.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we met again,
the first thing he asked me was,

00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:12.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you happy with what you are doing?”

00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:18.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems like a simple question, right?

00:17:19.888 --> 00:17:23.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this question went deeper.

00:17:27.396 --> 00:17:32.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m very grateful to him and his wife
for all the time they devoted to me.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:35.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were very busy,

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
but even on their day off or in the evenings

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
after long days of activity,

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
they spent time with me.

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:47.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, I moved to different cities
and changed to various teams.

00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:50.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he entrusted me, so to speak,

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:53.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to two other families.

00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:56.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
They poured themselves out for me,

00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:58.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
sacrificing their time,

00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:03.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
without ever making me feel bad
for what I did.

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:07.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
With regard to decisions about basketball,

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
they never told me what to do.

00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:12.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to reach that decision on my own,

00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:16.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether I should continue playing or not.

00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:21.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was their way of life that corrected me,
so to speak.

00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:24.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their example

00:18:24.953 --> 00:18:27.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their lifestyle, the priorities they set,

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:33.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the joy they had in doing
what they did—helped me.

00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:38.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was more their example

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:42.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
than their words.

00:18:43.238 --> 00:18:45.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped me understand

00:18:45.808 --> 00:18:49.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
what I really wanted from my life.

00:18:51.313 --> 00:18:54.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started in 1995

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continued until April 2008

00:18:58.287 --> 00:19:00.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I played my last match.

00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:08.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
I, let’s say,
made a cut and quit playing basketball.

00:19:08.096 --> 00:19:10.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad I made it.

00:19:10.999 --> 00:19:13.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I say to myself:

00:19:13.836 --> 00:19:16.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If only you’d done it earlier!

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
If only you’d had the courage earlier!’

00:19:20.475 --> 00:19:23.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the privilege
of serving as a regular pioneer

00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:25.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
for two and a half years.

00:19:26.982 --> 00:19:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was asked
if I would like to apply for Bethel service.

00:19:33.522 --> 00:19:37.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to my surprise,
I was invited to the Italy branch

00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:39.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
and served there for five years.

00:19:40.796 --> 00:19:42.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few months after leaving Bethel,

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:47.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the privilege of attending
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:19:48.503 --> 00:19:50.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was wonderful!

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
This sport
—basketball—

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:57.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s great, it’s thrilling, it’s exciting,

00:19:57.346 --> 00:20:00.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s not the source of true happiness.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:06.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true that the world
can give you a measure of satisfaction,

00:20:06.154 --> 00:20:09.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
but everything comes at a cost.

00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:15.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it took me
a long time to understand this.

00:20:16.832 --> 00:20:20.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that I am giving Jehovah my best

00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:22.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
has made me happy.

00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:26.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, there is a team,

00:20:26.174 --> 00:20:29.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
a large one, and we all play for Jehovah.

00:20:29.044 --> 00:20:32.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
And its goal is beautiful, it’s exciting,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its success is sure.

00:20:37.352 --> 00:20:41.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuele said he wished
he had given up basketball earlier

00:20:41.023 --> 00:20:43.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue spiritual goals.

00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:47.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
From that we learn that decisions
to spend time on personal interests

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:50.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
take away from time
we should give to Jehovah.

00:20:51.199 --> 00:20:54.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sooner we appreciate Jehovah’s patience,

00:20:54.636 --> 00:20:59.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sooner we enjoy the blessings
which make us truly rich.

00:21:00.208 --> 00:21:03.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy that Jehovah 
exercised patience with Brother Podestà

00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:06.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped him to regain his balance.

00:21:07.215 --> 00:21:09.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re facing a career decision,

00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:13.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
be assured that when we focus first

00:21:13.288 --> 00:21:16.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
on serving Jehovah
and teaching others his Word,

00:21:16.658 --> 00:21:18.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re happier!

00:21:19.728 --> 00:21:24.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuele was influenced by the patience
and good example of loving brothers.

00:21:25.634 --> 00:21:28.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we see how others
are handling situations,

00:21:28.637 --> 00:21:32.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may not be as patient as we’d like to be.

00:21:32.174 --> 00:21:36.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what happens to Neeta and Jade
in the following dramatization.

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:40.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do they learn to be more patient
with each other?

00:22:18.387 --> 00:22:19.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re late!

00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:21.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:22:21.523 --> 00:22:23.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “You’re late.”

00:22:23.191 --> 00:22:25.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:22:57.092 --> 00:22:59.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
You work here now?

00:23:00.695 --> 00:23:02.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, just a—
Just a few weeks.

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:05.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
You look great.

00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:11.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, what can I get you?

00:23:13.275 --> 00:23:15.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried texting, you know,

00:23:15.544 --> 00:23:17.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
after you ended it.

00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:23.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chai latte, that was your favorite.

00:23:24.686 --> 00:23:28.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, you were my favorite.

00:23:36.865 --> 00:23:40.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ollie, you know why I had to . . .

00:23:41.803 --> 00:23:43.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:23:45.073 --> 00:23:46.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:49.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I want to study your religion.

00:23:50.045 --> 00:23:51.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why I texted.

00:23:54.316 --> 00:23:58.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I got a new phone, and I didn’t—
I didn’t see them.

00:24:00.322 --> 00:24:04.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, but how about I leave you my number,

00:24:04.659 --> 00:24:06.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can meet up.

00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:09.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:12.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s when you walked away.

00:24:12.968 --> 00:24:15.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell me you walked away.

00:24:17.272 --> 00:24:19.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave me his number.

00:24:19.274 --> 00:24:20.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:24:23.178 --> 00:24:24.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade!

00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:26.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said he wants to study.

00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:29.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he wants to study you.

00:24:30.485 --> 00:24:32.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t read hearts.

00:24:33.421 --> 00:24:35.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I can read yours.

00:24:40.595 --> 00:24:43.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was sweet,

00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:47.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if he wants to know the truth . . .

00:24:49.137 --> 00:24:52.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
I— 
I can’t even believe this.

00:24:55.277 --> 00:24:57.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it say?

00:24:58.246 --> 00:25:00.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says low battery.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:06.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not that,
this—2 Corinthians 6:14.

00:25:09.124 --> 00:25:12.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not become unevenly yoked
with unbelievers.”

00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:16.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no yoking.
I haven’t yoked.

00:25:16.498 --> 00:25:19.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this opens the door to the yoke.

00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:20.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not stupid!

00:25:20.735 --> 00:25:22.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
You act like I don’t know this.

00:25:23.205 --> 00:25:25.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.
You act like you don’t know this.

00:25:35.283 --> 00:25:37.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a lot of backstory.

00:25:38.153 --> 00:25:40.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
You asked what happened.

00:25:41.223 --> 00:25:44.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought you’d like, you know,
sum it up in a word or something.

00:25:45.994 --> 00:25:48.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyway, now you know.

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
So are you going to call him then?

00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:56.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think so.

00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:58.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:03.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because I don’t think its religion
that he’s interested in.

00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:06.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could’ve told you that.

00:26:30.305 --> 00:26:31.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made you a cup.

00:26:38.747 --> 00:26:41.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.
You’re amazing.

00:26:42.384 --> 00:26:43.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:26:50.558 --> 00:26:52.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know I came on strong.

00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:55.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you were right.

00:26:58.533 --> 00:27:00.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I could have been more patient.

00:27:01.836 --> 00:27:03.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
I reacted too quickly.

00:27:05.573 --> 00:27:08.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you know
what the right thing to do is.

00:27:10.512 --> 00:27:13.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should have given you
more time to talk it out.

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:20.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
I called Brother Davies

00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:23.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave him the background

00:27:23.024 --> 00:27:27.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said, “If he’s really interested,
he’ll have a study.”

00:27:28.697 --> 00:27:32.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I deleted Ollie’s number.

00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:35.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew it.

00:27:35.937 --> 00:27:37.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew you’d do the right thing.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, sometimes.

00:27:43.778 --> 00:27:45.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I should’ve been more patient,

00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:49.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I should have heard you out.

00:27:50.652 --> 00:27:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just

00:27:53.188 --> 00:27:55.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
not what I wanted to hear
in the moment.

00:27:57.058 --> 00:27:58.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re good?

00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:59.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always.

00:28:02.464 --> 00:28:05.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, no more apologizing
until I finish this coffee;

00:28:05.467 --> 00:28:07.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s too painful.

00:28:10.905 --> 00:28:12.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so nice.

00:28:19.481 --> 00:28:23.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haven’t we enjoyed the journey
of Neeta and Jade

00:28:23.318 --> 00:28:25.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
from when they first appeared
in our convention videos

00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:28.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
up to these latest episodes?

00:28:28.523 --> 00:28:32.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve encountered situations
we can all relate to:

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade progressing from Bible student

00:28:35.697 --> 00:28:37.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Bible teacher,

00:28:37.732 --> 00:28:40.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
learning to reject falsehoods
about Jehovah’s people,

00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:44.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
and refining qualities like patience.

00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:48.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neeta has grown as a disciple-maker

00:28:48.443 --> 00:28:50.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a caring spiritual sister.

00:28:51.913 --> 00:28:54.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
The encouraging lesson for us:

00:28:54.282 --> 00:28:58.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep growing as a spiritual person.

00:29:00.221 --> 00:29:03.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Putting on “the new personality” isn’t easy.

00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:07.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can seem insurmountable
for those in the grip of an addiction.

00:29:08.863 --> 00:29:10.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see this in our next video.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helps Takeei break free
from compulsive gambling?

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:22.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad left us when I was around five years old.

00:29:24.145 --> 00:29:28.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when I was 15,
we found out Mum had cancer,

00:29:30.485 --> 00:29:33.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she passed away six months later.

00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:35.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was only 39.

00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:40.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
My two younger brothers
were still in elementary school,

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:42.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I woke up early,

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
did the milk rounds,
worked in a factory during the day,

00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:48.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and went to school at night.

00:29:49.938 --> 00:29:52.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life was super busy then.

00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:58.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life became significantly easier
after marriage.

00:29:58.346 --> 00:30:02.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since my wife did the housework,
all I needed to do was work.

00:30:04.586 --> 00:30:06.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I was so busy

00:30:06.588 --> 00:30:09.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I never really got to have any fun.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, a friend took me to a betting shop

00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:17.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
for horse racing,

00:30:20.835 --> 00:30:24.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to my surprise, I got lucky.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was surprised that you can buy a ticket

00:30:29.177 --> 00:30:32.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then you get all this money
in your hands.

00:30:33.114 --> 00:30:35.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s how it started.

00:30:39.153 --> 00:30:42.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gradually became worse, to the point

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:44.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I would get off of the night shift

00:30:44.692 --> 00:30:47.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
and go straight to the races.

00:30:47.362 --> 00:30:51.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved gambling more
than eating and sleeping.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:58.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
On my way home,
images of my wife and children

00:30:58.673 --> 00:31:00.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
would come to my mind,

00:31:00.508 --> 00:31:03.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I had this nagging feeling

00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:05.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I really should
be getting my life together.

00:31:06.848 --> 00:31:10.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was broke,
I would go to the pawn shops.

00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:15.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
I pawned our camera
and even my wife’s jewelry.

00:31:17.692 --> 00:31:20.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife started studying the Bible,

00:31:20.828 --> 00:31:24.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to try and make my wife and children
a little happy,

00:31:24.532 --> 00:31:26.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also agreed to a study.

00:31:28.336 --> 00:31:32.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I started gambling,
I liked growing vegetables.

00:31:34.709 --> 00:31:37.145 line:10% position:50% align:center
You know, everything a vegetable needs,

00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.646 line:10% position:50% align:center
all the instructions to grow,

00:31:38.646 --> 00:31:41.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in this tiny seed

00:31:41.015 --> 00:31:43.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is one or two millimeters in size.

00:31:43.885 --> 00:31:47.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that couldn’t just happen by chance.

00:31:49.357 --> 00:31:51.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was convinced

00:31:51.926 --> 00:31:54.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there must be a God.

00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:57.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through my Bible study,

00:31:57.231 --> 00:31:59.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned that this God is Jehovah,

00:31:59.834 --> 00:32:02.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that made me really happy.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I found you!’
That’s how I felt.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, it was really difficult
to quit gambling.

00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:13.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, many times I wanted to quit,

00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:15.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would pay back my loans

00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:17.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then take out some more again.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife’s relative said to me,

00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:23.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Only death can cure you.”

00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:29.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I had this conviction
that the Creator exists,

00:32:29.998 --> 00:32:34.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet on the other hand,
I was deep into gambling.

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:38.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew Jehovah saw it all,
and I hated myself.

00:32:40.074 --> 00:32:43.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
I attended a circuit assembly
for the first time.

00:32:47.749 --> 00:32:52.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Put away the old personality,
and put on the new personality.’

00:32:52.487 --> 00:32:55.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was reading those words from the Bible,

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that was about me.

00:32:58.793 --> 00:33:03.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I asked myself, ‘Hey, what’s happening
to my life right now?,’

00:33:03.798 --> 00:33:06.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how horrible and ugly

00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:09.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mindset was.

00:33:09.937 --> 00:33:12.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt tears well up.

00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:15.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew this was Jehovah talking to me,

00:33:15.743 --> 00:33:20.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I felt determined
to do something about it.

00:33:22.183 --> 00:33:25.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t do it on my own,

00:33:25.286 --> 00:33:29.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I prayed to Jehovah
from the bottom of my heart, saying:

00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:34.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I really want to stop, no matter what.

00:33:35.296 --> 00:33:39.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I want to hate gambling
and not just avoid it.

00:33:39.534 --> 00:33:42.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please give me this feeling of hate.”

00:33:42.737 --> 00:33:44.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed like this every day.

00:33:48.443 --> 00:33:50.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since then,

00:33:51.713 --> 00:33:54.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have felt zero desire to gamble.

00:33:56.451 --> 00:34:00.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was one time during work
when I passed by a racetrack.

00:34:01.556 --> 00:34:04.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved bicycle racing before,

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:07.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now I felt this deep revulsion.

00:34:10.565 --> 00:34:12.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
my prayers were answered.

00:34:20.441 --> 00:34:22.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt Jehovah’s patience

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:25.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so much appreciation

00:34:26.447 --> 00:34:27.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
for

00:34:30.551 --> 00:34:33.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he allowed me in,

00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:35.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing who I was.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I had continued that path,

00:34:45.366 --> 00:34:49.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure my family would have broken apart.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
My relatives are all surprised at me.

00:34:53.808 --> 00:34:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure those trying to stop gambling
have many concerns,

00:34:57.745 --> 00:35:02.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as long as you have that desire
to pour out those feelings to Jehovah

00:35:02.617 --> 00:35:04.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
and jump into his arms,

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:06.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll take you in.

00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:09.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
He won’t leave you.

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:11.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really want them to know Jehovah

00:35:11.058 --> 00:35:13.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
as that kind of Person.

00:35:17.098 --> 00:35:19.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
How encouraging!

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:23.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re fighting an addiction,
don’t give up!

00:35:23.304 --> 00:35:26.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pour your heart out to Jehovah
and ask for his help.

00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:30.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be discouraged if you suffer setbacks.

00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:33.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will be patient with you,

00:35:33.414 --> 00:35:35.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he was with Takeei.

00:35:36.717 --> 00:35:40.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
that our brother’s addiction began subtly?

00:35:40.655 --> 00:35:44.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
If only he had detected
the early warning signs!

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we remain alert

00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:51.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
and safeguard our heart?

00:35:51.265 --> 00:35:53.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out in this Bethel morning worship

00:35:53.868 --> 00:35:57.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Brother David Splane,
a member of the Governing Body.

00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:03.010 line:10% position:50% align:center
Solomon had three horrible half brothers

00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:06.113 line:10% position:50% align:center
—Amnon,

00:36:06.113 --> 00:36:09.250 line:10% position:50% align:center
Adonijah, and Absalom.

00:36:10.218 --> 00:36:12.720 line:10% position:50% align:center
They were a lot older than he was,

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Solomon didn’t try to imitate them.

00:36:15.456 --> 00:36:17.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he didn’t allow himself to be stumbled

00:36:17.992 --> 00:36:20.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
by their bad conduct, as if to say,

00:36:20.394 --> 00:36:22.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, if that’s the kind of people
they have around here,

00:36:22.964 --> 00:36:25.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want nothing to do
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.’

00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:29.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Solomon followed his own path.

00:36:29.136 --> 00:36:33.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
He developed a strong personal relationship
with Jehovah God.

00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:39.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember what the Bible says
about Solomon in the beginning?

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved him.

00:36:41.816 --> 00:36:43.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:36:43.384 --> 00:36:46.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you love it
if that were said about you?

00:36:46.254 --> 00:36:47.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would.

00:36:47.421 --> 00:36:50.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved Solomon,

00:36:50.024 --> 00:36:53.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed Solomon in many ways.

00:36:53.361 --> 00:36:58.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, while Solomon was faithful,
Israel was at peace.

00:36:58.199 --> 00:37:02.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Solomon said: “Jehovah my God
has given me rest [all around].

00:37:02.403 --> 00:37:04.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no one opposing me

00:37:04.505 --> 00:37:09.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing bad [is] happening.”

00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:13.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was only
after Solomon became unfaithful

00:37:13.814 --> 00:37:17.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
that resisters were raised up in Israel.

00:37:17.551 --> 00:37:22.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only was Israel at peace
when Solomon was at peace with God,

00:37:22.089 --> 00:37:24.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Israel was rich.

00:37:24.458 --> 00:37:26.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon had no financial problems.

00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:31.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that the silver
was as common as the stones.

00:37:31.132 --> 00:37:34.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Solomon started
drawing away from Jehovah,

00:37:34.969 --> 00:37:37.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah withdrew his blessing.

00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:41.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that prosperity didn’t last
even during Solomon’s reign. 

00:37:41.943 --> 00:37:44.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight</i>  tells us

00:37:44.278 --> 00:37:47.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there was a drain on Israel’s economy.

00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:51.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon was still spending money
as if it were going out of style,

00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:54.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he didn’t have the income
that he once had.

00:37:54.822 --> 00:37:58.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, even materially, Israel suffered.

00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:01.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Rehoboam did not inherit
the wealth from Solomon

00:38:01.762 --> 00:38:05.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Solomon had
had at the peak of his reign.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as our comment points out,
for much of his reign,

00:38:08.836 --> 00:38:11.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon did a lot of good things.

00:38:11.872 --> 00:38:15.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is it possible
that right from the beginning,

00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:20.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
as involved as Solomon
was in theocratic projects,

00:38:20.014 --> 00:38:22.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a little red flag

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that something wasn’t quite right?

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s possible.

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:32.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as our comment points out,
when Solomon became king,

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:37.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was a young man,
but he was a young married man.

00:38:37.098 --> 00:38:38.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, when he became king,

00:38:38.766 --> 00:38:41.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon had probably been married
for a couple of years already.

00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:44.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a little boy.
He was a daddy.

00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:47.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a little boy—one-year-old Rehoboam.

00:38:49.143 --> 00:38:51.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who was his wife

00:38:51.345 --> 00:38:53.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
—probably his first wife?

00:38:53.948 --> 00:38:58.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was an Ammonitess.

00:38:58.552 --> 00:39:02.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ammonitess—what do we remember
about “Ammonitess”?

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:06.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, Deuteronomy chapter 23

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 3.

00:39:13.367 --> 00:39:17.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember, when Solomon gets married,
King David is still alive.

00:39:17.371 --> 00:39:20.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
David is probably at the wedding.

00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:23.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s what Deuteronomy 23:3 says:

00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:26.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No Ammonite

00:39:26.013 --> 00:39:30.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or Moabite may come
into the congregation of Jehovah.

00:39:30.217 --> 00:39:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even to the tenth generation,

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“none of their descendants

00:39:34.889 --> 00:39:39.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
may ever come
into the congregation of Jehovah.”

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
What part of “never”
did Solomon not understand?

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:49.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so could that mean
that even before he became king,

00:39:49.937 --> 00:39:54.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon had a casual view
of Jehovah’s laws on marriage?

00:39:54.408 --> 00:39:56.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s possible.

00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:59.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, why do we say “possible”?

00:39:59.113 --> 00:40:01.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, without being dogmatic, 

00:40:01.449 --> 00:40:04.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight</i>  says that there may
have been exceptions for foreign women

00:40:04.618 --> 00:40:07.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Ruth the Moabitess.

00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:10.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
But <i>Insight</i>  also says

00:40:10.357 --> 00:40:13.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Solomon’s Ammonite wife

00:40:13.194 --> 00:40:15.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
possibly contributed to his apostasy.

00:40:15.796 --> 00:40:19.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any event, why was the first wife

00:40:19.767 --> 00:40:23.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
a foreign woman and an Ammonitess to boot?

00:40:25.806 --> 00:40:29.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if Solomon
had married a nice Jewish girl

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:31.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
(just one)

00:40:31.245 --> 00:40:34.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ‘rejoiced with the wife of his youth,’

00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:37.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t you think that the history of Israel
would have been much different?

00:40:37.785 --> 00:40:40.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it would have been.

00:40:40.121 --> 00:40:44.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s take a moment to think
about the women Solomon did marry

00:40:44.158 --> 00:40:47.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
—pagan women.

00:40:47.061 --> 00:40:50.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you may have relatives
who are not in the truth;

00:40:50.564 --> 00:40:54.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
you love your relatives,
and you go visit from time to time.

00:40:54.668 --> 00:40:58.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how long is it before you
run out of things to talk about?

00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:03.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we just don’t have
the most important thing in common—the truth.

00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:06.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to ask:

00:41:06.447 --> 00:41:10.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was Solomon so comfortable
with these pagan women?

00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:13.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he talk about?

00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:17.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you can be sure he wasn’t studying
<i>The Watchtower</i>  with them.

00:41:17.024 --> 00:41:18.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was he doing?

00:41:18.292 --> 00:41:21.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the attraction
to these foreign women?

00:41:21.662 --> 00:41:24.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it their humility?

00:41:24.532 --> 00:41:27.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
their modest dress?

00:41:27.668 --> 00:41:30.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
their “chaste conduct”?

00:41:30.204 --> 00:41:33.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
their “quiet and mild spirit”?

00:41:33.207 --> 00:41:35.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or was it mainly physical?

00:41:36.844 --> 00:41:38.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s be blunt.

00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:43.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon was attracted
to the wrong kind of woman.

00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:48.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there may have been early warning signs.

00:41:48.022 --> 00:41:52.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of “red flags,”
when Solomon began marrying many women,

00:41:52.326 --> 00:41:55.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
did a prophet or a priest ever approach him

00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:57.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give him some counsel?

00:41:57.598 --> 00:42:02.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they ever read Deuteronomy 17:17,
which applied directly to the king?

00:42:03.671 --> 00:42:05.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 17:17

00:42:06.974 --> 00:42:08.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it says about the king:

00:42:08.976 --> 00:42:12.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Neither should he take
many wives for himself,

00:42:12.146 --> 00:42:16.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that his heart may not go astray.”

00:42:16.717 --> 00:42:20.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if he did receive that counsel,
he certainly didn’t apply it.

00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:24.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if he didn’t receive that counsel,
we wonder, ‘Why not?’

00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:28.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the application?

00:42:28.162 --> 00:42:32.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we may be very busy
in Jehovah’s organization,

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we have to be alert to any red flags

00:42:36.403 --> 00:42:40.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
that despite outward appearances,
all is not well with us.

00:42:41.675 --> 00:42:45.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
A single brother is a regular publisher.

00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:47.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a regular meeting attender.

00:42:47.581 --> 00:42:51.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on his nights off,
he likes to go to nightclubs,

00:42:51.085 --> 00:42:54.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s comfortable in that atmosphere.

00:42:54.088 --> 00:42:58.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
He isn’t shy about striking up conversations
with worldly people,

00:42:58.292 --> 00:43:00.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he loves to dance.

00:43:00.327 --> 00:43:04.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are no sisters there,
so he dances with worldly women.

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:07.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the attraction?

00:43:07.034 --> 00:43:09.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is busy in the congregation,

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:13.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there’s something there
that isn’t quite right.

00:43:14.441 --> 00:43:17.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
A young pioneer brother loves to flirt.

00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:21.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several young sisters think
he’s interested only in them.

00:43:21.115 --> 00:43:24.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
The attention makes them feel special.

00:43:25.386 --> 00:43:27.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
A ministerial servant

00:43:27.388 --> 00:43:31.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
spends a lot of time
talking to a married woman.

00:43:31.892 --> 00:43:35.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was asked about it,
he justifies it and says: “We’re just friends.

00:43:35.796 --> 00:43:37.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re just talking.”

00:43:37.798 --> 00:43:40.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Famous last words.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
A fine young sister is offended

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:47.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
when an older sister approaches her
and points out that her skirts and jeans

00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:50.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
are too tight, too revealing.

00:43:51.845 --> 00:43:53.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, all of these are red flags.

00:43:55.015 --> 00:43:58.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to examine ourselves
from time to time to see whether,

00:43:58.385 --> 00:44:00.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how many privileges we have,

00:44:00.954 --> 00:44:03.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
something isn’t quite right.

00:44:05.392 --> 00:44:07.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to choosing a mate,

00:44:07.628 --> 00:44:11.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon’s example can be instructive to us.

00:44:11.198 --> 00:44:14.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what qualities
do we value in a marriage mate

00:44:14.435 --> 00:44:16.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
—spiritual qualities?

00:44:16.437 --> 00:44:18.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it merely the physical

00:44:18.439 --> 00:44:22.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we hope that the spiritual
will catch up later?

00:44:22.042 --> 00:44:25.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
A younger sister is getting acquainted
with a young brother.

00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:28.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is really good looking
and has a great personality

00:44:28.282 --> 00:44:30.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gets along with everybody.

00:44:30.517 --> 00:44:32.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how is he doing spiritually?

00:44:32.953 --> 00:44:37.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he have a good schedule
for theocratic activities, and does he stick to it?

00:44:37.491 --> 00:44:41.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example: If you mention an article
in a recent magazine,

00:44:41.362 --> 00:44:44.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
does he often say,
“I must have missed that one”?

00:44:45.799 --> 00:44:48.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that’s what happens, it’s a bad sign.

00:44:49.937 --> 00:44:53.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he make spiritual activities
a priority in his life?

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he doesn’t do that while he is single,

00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:59.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
what makes you think that he’s going
to do it after you get married?

00:44:59.847 --> 00:45:04.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you change him, or will he change you?

00:45:05.552 --> 00:45:10.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our comment reminds us,
Solomon enjoyed many privileges.

00:45:10.023 --> 00:45:13.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he apparently felt that some of God’s laws
just didn’t apply to him.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:45:14.528 --> 00:45:15.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t know.

00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:19.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could it be what Solomon
said in Ecclesiastes:

00:45:19.566 --> 00:45:22.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The king does whatever he wants’?

00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:23.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe so.

00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:29.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon multiplied horses
and acquired many wives for himself.

00:45:29.276 --> 00:45:31.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the lesson for us?

00:45:31.779 --> 00:45:34.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how long we’ve been in the truth,

00:45:34.181 --> 00:45:36.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how many privileges we have,

00:45:36.283 --> 00:45:38.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how much Jehovah has used us,

00:45:38.886 --> 00:45:42.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can’t afford to let down our guard.

00:45:42.623 --> 00:45:45.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must guard our heart,

00:45:45.559 --> 00:45:48.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we mustn’t ignore any red flags

00:45:48.195 --> 00:45:51.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might indicate that all is not well.

00:45:52.599 --> 00:45:57.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Theocratic conventions
are a spiritual highlight of every year.

00:45:57.004 --> 00:46:00.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
They play an important role
in fostering unity

00:46:00.274 --> 00:46:03.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love among Jehovah’s people.

00:46:03.377 --> 00:46:06.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this episode of <i>Our History in Motion,</i>

00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:08.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s explore how conventions

00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:11.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
have become an essential part
of modern-day worship.

00:46:13.954 --> 00:46:16.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good morning, brothers and sisters!

00:46:16.123 --> 00:46:18.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
How delightful it is to be gathered together

00:46:18.725 --> 00:46:20.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this spiritual occasion!

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
love gathering at conventions

00:46:26.733 --> 00:46:30.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn, worship, and sing together.

00:46:30.637 --> 00:46:32.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
But large conventions like these,

00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:35.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
with tens of thousands meeting together,

00:46:35.576 --> 00:46:38.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
weren’t always a part
of our modern-day worship.

00:46:38.479 --> 00:46:40.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they get started?

00:46:40.581 --> 00:46:42.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out in this episode

00:46:42.749 --> 00:46:45.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:56.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
The very first large assembly
of Jehovah’s people 

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
was actually held thousands of years ago

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:03.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Israelites gathered
with Moses at Mount Sinai

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:05.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
for spiritual instruction.

00:47:05.706 --> 00:47:10.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, the Israelites
attended three festivals each year.

00:47:10.544 --> 00:47:12.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just like today’s conventions,

00:47:12.713 --> 00:47:16.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
those gatherings brought people together
from different tribes

00:47:16.717 --> 00:47:19.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
to praise Him as one big family.

00:47:19.653 --> 00:47:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
In modern times,

00:47:21.188 --> 00:47:24.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
our first conventions
were held in the late 1880’s.

00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:29.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they weren’t exactly
what we’d think of as conventions today.

00:47:29.463 --> 00:47:31.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
With just a few hundred in attendance,

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:35.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were really just big meetings
that brought the Bible Students together

00:47:35.636 --> 00:47:38.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
to commemorate the Lord’s Evening Meal.

00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:42.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were all held
in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

00:47:44.311 --> 00:47:47.381 line:10% position:50% align:center
But that changed in 1893

00:47:47.381 --> 00:47:50.450 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the opening of the Chicago World’s Fair.

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fair drew millions of people.

00:47:52.953 --> 00:47:56.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the railroads offering
discounted rates to Chicago,

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:59.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students saw it
as a perfect opportunity

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
to invite the brothers and sisters
for a five-day convention.

00:48:04.765 --> 00:48:07.634 line:10% position:50% align:center
About 360 attended

00:48:07.634 --> 00:48:11.171 line:10% position:50% align:center
—a small crowd by today’s standards.

00:48:11.171 --> 00:48:13.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
But early conventions like this one

00:48:13.774 --> 00:48:17.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped the Bible Students see
just how upbuilding it was

00:48:17.344 --> 00:48:20.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet with fellow believers
from other areas.

00:48:21.615 --> 00:48:25.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually,
conventions became an annual event.

00:48:26.753 --> 00:48:29.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were held outdoors or in a tent,

00:48:29.823 --> 00:48:32.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the 1908 convention at Put-in-Bay,

00:48:32.826 --> 00:48:35.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
a summer resort on Lake Erie, Ohio.

00:48:35.796 --> 00:48:39.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
This convention was ten days long!

00:48:39.032 --> 00:48:41.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was the largest up to that time,

00:48:41.635 --> 00:48:46.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an estimated 3,500 or more
in attendance.

00:48:46.173 --> 00:48:49.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a chance for brothers and sisters,
young and old,

00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:53.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be spiritually refreshed,
spend time together,

00:48:53.213 --> 00:48:55.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
laugh together, eat together,

00:48:55.515 --> 00:48:59.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build true bonds of friendship and love.

00:49:01.254 --> 00:49:05.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world then suffered
the devastating effects of World War I

00:49:05.325 --> 00:49:08.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic

00:49:08.562 --> 00:49:11.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had taken an estimated 50 million lives.

00:49:12.699 --> 00:49:15.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that did not stop God’s people.

00:49:15.502 --> 00:49:18.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our bonds of love became even more evident

00:49:18.705 --> 00:49:21.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1919 at Cedar Point, Ohio.

00:49:21.508 --> 00:49:24.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the first major convention held

00:49:24.077 --> 00:49:26.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Brother Rutherford and his associates

00:49:26.647 --> 00:49:29.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
had been released from prison.

00:49:29.316 --> 00:49:32.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thrilled to finally gather together safely,

00:49:32.586 --> 00:49:35.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students
just kept coming and coming

00:49:35.522 --> 00:49:38.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the entire program
had to be moved outdoors,

00:49:38.759 --> 00:49:41.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
with some 7,000 in attendance.

00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:47.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just three years later, in 1922,

00:49:47.901 --> 00:49:52.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cedar Point was the location
of an even more exciting convention,

00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:57.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an average daily attendance
of about 10,000.

00:49:58.512 --> 00:50:03.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
It energized God’s people
to go on preaching with renewed vigor.

00:50:05.018 --> 00:50:07.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many conventions in the years that followed

00:50:07.521 --> 00:50:11.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped unite God’s people
in even more powerful ways,

00:50:11.725 --> 00:50:16.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the unforgettable one
held in Columbus, Ohio, in 1931.

00:50:17.864 --> 00:50:21.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine stepping into the Coliseum
at the Fair Grounds,

00:50:21.968 --> 00:50:24.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are 15,000 in attendance,

00:50:24.838 --> 00:50:27.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the place is packed.

00:50:27.874 --> 00:50:31.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your program has two large letters
printed on the front:

00:50:31.812 --> 00:50:33.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW.

00:50:33.814 --> 00:50:36.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the first two days of the convention,

00:50:36.249 --> 00:50:39.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone is trying to guess
what those letters mean.

00:50:39.653 --> 00:50:41.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just Watch?

00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:43.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just Wait?

00:50:43.256 --> 00:50:46.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, Brother Rutherford steps on stage.

00:50:46.993 --> 00:50:50.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Near the end of his talk,
he presents a resolution

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:53.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
that climaxes with the words:

00:50:53.066 --> 00:50:58.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We desire to be known as
and called by the name, to wit, 

00:50:58.004 --> 00:51:01.074 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>Jehovah’s witnesses.</i>”

00:51:05.746 --> 00:51:07.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1940’s,

00:51:07.748 --> 00:51:12.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
World War II had left many countries
devastated and divided,

00:51:13.286 --> 00:51:17.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah’s Witnesses
were growing in number and in unity.

00:51:17.691 --> 00:51:19.860 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 1946,

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.095 line:10% position:50% align:center
they gathered in Cleveland, Ohio,

00:51:22.095 --> 00:51:25.031 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly,

00:51:25.031 --> 00:51:26.433 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the name

00:51:26.433 --> 00:51:28.435 line:10% position:50% align:center
couldn’t have been more appropriate.

00:51:29.302 --> 00:51:32.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a true international convention

00:51:32.973 --> 00:51:35.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 55,000 delegates

00:51:35.942 --> 00:51:38.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 33 different nations.

00:51:38.311 --> 00:51:41.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some even camped
in tents and trailers to be there.

00:51:41.982 --> 00:51:44.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tent cities were a common sight

00:51:44.151 --> 00:51:46.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
during big conventions of this era.

00:51:47.454 --> 00:51:51.491 line:10% position:50% align:center
With our spiritual family continuing to grow,

00:51:51.491 --> 00:51:53.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
conventions during the 1950’s

00:51:53.727 --> 00:51:56.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
were held around the world

00:51:56.163 --> 00:51:59.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in places where resources were limited.

00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:02.469 line:10% position:50% align:center
A landmark example

00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:04.337 line:10% position:50% align:center
of just how international

00:52:04.337 --> 00:52:06.072 line:10% position:50% align:center
conventions had become

00:52:06.072 --> 00:52:07.808 line:10% position:50% align:center
was the incredible

00:52:07.808 --> 00:52:11.311 line:10% position:50% align:center
1958 Divine Will International Assembly

00:52:11.311 --> 00:52:12.746 line:10% position:50% align:center
in New York City,

00:52:12.746 --> 00:52:14.080 line:10% position:50% align:center
which was attended

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.350 line:10% position:50% align:center
by more than a quarter of a million people

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.352 line:10% position:50% align:center
from 123 lands.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the largest international convention

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
ever held in one city,

00:52:25.492 --> 00:52:27.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
filling Yankee Stadium

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, just four blocks away, the Polo Grounds.

00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:33.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest assembly
of true Christians ever held

00:52:33.266 --> 00:52:34.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
is opening this day.

00:52:34.901 --> 00:52:37.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are certain that Jehovah is with us

00:52:37.838 --> 00:52:40.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we are here by divine will.

00:52:42.742 --> 00:52:46.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what unified God’s people
at conventions like this one

00:52:46.379 --> 00:52:49.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
wasn’t simply gathering together
in large numbers.

00:52:49.749 --> 00:52:52.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the spiritual content:

00:52:52.219 --> 00:52:54.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
riveting talks,

00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:57.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
practical symposiums, new releases

00:52:57.557 --> 00:53:00.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, starting in the 1960’s,

00:53:00.026 --> 00:53:03.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible dramas on stage in full costume.

00:53:04.531 --> 00:53:06.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those spiritual gifts

00:53:06.533 --> 00:53:10.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the joy of meeting new friends
and uniting with old ones

00:53:10.637 --> 00:53:14.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
have made assembling together
a true blessing.

00:53:15.809 --> 00:53:18.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it hasn’t always been easy.

00:53:18.078 --> 00:53:20.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the country of Georgia,

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:23.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Witnesses had faced severe opposition,

00:53:23.116 --> 00:53:25.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
plans were set to hold

00:53:25.118 --> 00:53:29.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
the 2006 “Deliverance at Hand!”
District Convention

00:53:29.322 --> 00:53:31.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Tbilisi Philharmonic concert hall.

00:53:31.992 --> 00:53:35.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the hall management canceled the contract

00:53:35.228 --> 00:53:38.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
just one week before the convention!

00:53:39.266 --> 00:53:42.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
With just days before the opening session,

00:53:42.135 --> 00:53:45.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
an army of determined brothers and sisters

00:53:45.171 --> 00:53:48.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
turned two plots of farmland
into a convention site

00:53:49.509 --> 00:53:52.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
—harvesting the potatoes
planted on the property,

00:53:52.312 --> 00:53:55.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
building a stage and benches for seating,

00:53:55.749 --> 00:53:58.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and installing sound equipment.

00:53:59.319 --> 00:54:03.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it was time for the first session,
everything was ready

00:54:03.123 --> 00:54:05.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more than 17,000 attended

00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:08.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
either on site or by telephone tie-in.

00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:12.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only did the convention
come off without a hitch

00:54:12.799 --> 00:54:17.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the attendees were overwhelmed
with another unexpected blessing

00:54:17.304 --> 00:54:20.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the <i>New World Translation</i>  in Georgian—

00:54:20.607 --> 00:54:22.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
unifying them even further

00:54:22.776 --> 00:54:25.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their brothers and sisters
around the world.

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
In modern times like these,

00:54:28.882 --> 00:54:31.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
special and international conventions

00:54:31.284 --> 00:54:34.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been held in far-flung places
around the world.

00:54:34.754 --> 00:54:37.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when it was impossible to meet in person,

00:54:37.624 --> 00:54:39.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve even met online!

00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:43.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
From Poland to Korea,

00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:45.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Australia to South Africa,

00:54:45.632 --> 00:54:48.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
conventions were, and still are,

00:54:48.668 --> 00:54:50.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
joyful spiritual occasions

00:54:50.804 --> 00:54:52.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of God’s people.

00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:54.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
They motivate and encourage us,

00:54:54.874 --> 00:54:57.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
unite us as brothers and sisters

00:54:57.043 --> 00:54:59.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, most important,

00:54:59.045 --> 00:55:01.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
draw us closer to Jehovah.

00:55:08.989 --> 00:55:11.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we gather as a united spiritual family,

00:55:11.858 --> 00:55:15.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a shout of praise to Jehovah.

00:55:15.095 --> 00:55:19.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also powerful evidence
that we are a loving brotherhood.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
we have to promote unity every day,

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:27.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when someone has hurt
our feelings and our patience is tested.

00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:30.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah’s help,

00:55:30.744 --> 00:55:34.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can become friends again,

00:55:34.114 --> 00:55:36.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the appealing title
of our new music video.

00:55:37.917 --> 00:55:41.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we watch it,
we want to show you a feature

00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:44.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may help you benefit
more from the broadcast.

00:55:45.058 --> 00:55:49.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Subtitles are available
in a number of languages.

00:55:49.162 --> 00:55:52.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a video has subtitles for your language,

00:55:52.399 --> 00:55:55.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see this icon
at the bottom of your screen.

00:55:55.935 --> 00:55:59.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Click the icon to turn subtitles on and off.

00:56:09.883 --> 00:56:14.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, please enjoy
the music video <i>Friends</i> <i>Again.</i>

00:56:37.911 --> 00:56:47.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
For much too long, I’ve held it in.
It weighs me down and clouds my sight.

00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:56.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
This grudge I’ve held since I was hurt,
I’ve held it close.

00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:00.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s just not right.
That’s never right.

00:57:00.133 --> 00:57:11.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now it’s time to find a way,
To find a way to let it go,

00:57:11.177 --> 00:57:22.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
To just forgive and make amends,
Be close again, be friends again.

00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:45.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever hurt I might forgive,
Whatever wrong that I let go,

00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:55.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realize they don’t compare
With God’s free gift—the love he shows.

00:57:55.255 --> 00:57:58.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
What love he shows!

00:57:58.024 --> 00:58:08.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now it’s time to find a way,
To find a way to let it go,

00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:19.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
To just forgive and make amends,
Be close again, be friends again.

00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:30.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll make the first move.
I won’t delay, not one more day.

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:38.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s time for both of us
To be OK.

00:58:38.131 --> 00:58:41.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be OK.

00:59:04.958 --> 00:59:15.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves the two of us.
He wants to see our friendship grow.

00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:25.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I forgive, my heart is light.
So I’ll forgive and let it go.

00:59:25.245 --> 00:59:27.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just let it go.

00:59:27.447 --> 00:59:38.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now it’s time to find a way,
To find a way to let it go,

00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:49.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
To just forgive and make amends,
Be close again, be friends again,

00:59:49.002 --> 00:59:54.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be close again, be friends again.

00:59:54.941 --> 00:59:59.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll make the first move.

01:00:13.326 --> 01:00:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our program has focused
on the beautiful quality of patience.

01:00:18.998 --> 01:00:22.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned to be patient
with the way others handle situations.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:25.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw how Jehovah is patient with us

01:00:25.772 --> 01:00:28.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we free ourselves from destructive habits

01:00:28.441 --> 01:00:32.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how our patience and love 
reassures others too.

01:00:33.579 --> 01:00:35.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this month’s video postcard,

01:00:35.581 --> 01:00:38.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
we travel to Guatemala in Central America.

01:00:39.686 --> 01:00:43.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
What aspects
of Jehovah’s creation do you enjoy?

01:00:43.022 --> 01:00:44.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
jungles?

01:00:45.158 --> 01:00:46.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
beaches?

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
mountains? rain forests?

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:53.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guatemala has them all!

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:57.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
It even has volcanoes
—lots of volcanoes!

01:00:57.537 --> 01:01:00.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Southern Guatemala has a string of 27.

01:01:02.108 --> 01:01:05.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first missionaries arrived in 1945.

01:01:05.778 --> 01:01:07.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1958,

01:01:07.113 --> 01:01:11.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were more than 700 Witnesses
in three circuits.

01:01:11.184 --> 01:01:14.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Difficulties arose
in the 1980’s when the government

01:01:14.187 --> 01:01:18.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
organized armed civilians
to patrol communities.

01:01:18.057 --> 01:01:20.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our brothers
were threatened with death

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:23.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they did not join the civil patrols.

01:01:23.129 --> 01:01:25.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they stood firm! 

01:01:26.899 --> 01:01:29.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, about 40,000 publishers

01:01:29.869 --> 01:01:33.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
serve in more than 850 congregations.

01:01:33.573 --> 01:01:36.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their preaching methods
are as diverse as the geography.

01:01:37.977 --> 01:01:40.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guatemala’s official language is Spanish,

01:01:40.713 --> 01:01:45.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
but more than 20 indigenous languages
are also spoken there,

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Mam.

01:01:47.887 --> 01:01:50.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 500 publishers in 20 congregations

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:53.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
share the good news in the Mam language.

01:01:54.527 --> 01:01:57.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
These brothers and sisters
are among the 49 publishers

01:01:57.930 --> 01:02:02.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Ostuncalco Mam Congregation
in Quetzaltenango.

01:02:03.369 --> 01:02:07.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
They send you their love and greetings.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:02:10.076 --> 01:02:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
