Welcome to JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:06.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we have in store for you?

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some highlights.

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:12.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
DiDi Brown lost her daughter
in an unimaginable tragedy.

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jehovah comfort her?

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Racial and national prejudice
is hard to overcome for some people.

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll go to Greece
and see a beautiful example

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of impartial love in action.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new song reminds us

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when we make time for Jehovah,

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel his presence in our life.

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:39.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for March 2022.

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:01.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no doubt that we’re living

00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:05.148 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in “critical times hard to deal with,”

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.717 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
just as the apostle Paul prophesied

00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:11.755 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
under inspiration in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times, we’ve read Matthew chapter 24,

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark chapter 13, Luke chapter 21,

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Revelation chapter 6.

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But who would ever have known

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how deeply a pandemic,

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:33.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so-called natural disasters,
violence, and unrest

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would affect us economically,

00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:40.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physically, and even emotionally?

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you dear friends
face unimaginable hardships.

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have experienced loss of loved ones,

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:52.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imprisonment, physical abuse,

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:54.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sickness, financial problems,

00:01:54.798 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes a number of these

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other circumstances all at the same time.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:07.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You dear brothers and sisters
are in our prayers.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this in mind, the theme for our program

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:13.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “In Difficult Times,

00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah Always Comforts.”

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:20.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that’s become familiar
to Jehovah’s people

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4:

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Praised be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father of tender mercies

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the God of all comfort,

00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:39.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who comforts us in all our trials

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:42.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that we may be able to comfort others

00:02:42.512 --> 00:02:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in any sort of trial with the comfort

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:48.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive from God.”

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:51.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Study Bible </i> says this

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:56.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the expression
“the Father of tender mercies”:

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:59.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Greek noun
rendered ‘tender mercies’ . . .

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:03.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is here used to describe a feeling
of compassion,

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or pity, for others.

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:10.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is called <b>the Father,</b>
or the Source, <b>of tender mercies</b>

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:15.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because compassion emanates
from him and is part of his nature.

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:19.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Such tender feelings move him

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:22.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to act mercifully in behalf
of his faithful servants

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:24.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are suffering tribulation.”

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regarding the phrase,
“the God of all comfort,”

00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it continues: “The Greek noun . . .
here rendered ‘comfort,’

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“literally means ‘a calling to one’s side.’

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:41.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It conveys the idea
of standing next to a person,

00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:43.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“helping or encouraging him

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when he is undergoing trials
or feeling sad. . . .

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God uses his powerful active force

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:53.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to give comfort and help in situations

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that from a human viewpoint seem hopeless.”

00:03:58.254 --> 00:04:00.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about what that means.

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:05.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to know
that whatever we face,

00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:08.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is by our side, helping us

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re undergoing any sort of trial.

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he did not promise
that he’d remove our trials.

00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:19.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, he eases our misery, or grief,

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever we undergo difficulties.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful word picture
of God standing next to us,

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:29.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when things seem hopeless!

00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:34.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to do a personal study project.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Using the publication
<i>Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses </i>

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:41.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the <i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™,</i>

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:44.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do a word search on “comfort.”

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:48.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be drawn even closer to Jehovah

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:52.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appreciate his unmatched desire

00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ability to comfort.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also inspired Paul to show

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:02.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he would stand by us to comfort us.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Romans 15:4:

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:13.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“</b>For all the things
that were written beforehand

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:16.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were written for our instruction,

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that through our endurance

“and through the comfort from the Scriptures

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:25.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might have hope.”

00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:28.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Comfort from the Scriptures”

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—time limits us from going
into all of the ways

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:33.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible does this.

00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s take some examples.

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that Jehovah’s people
have often meditated on in recent times

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:45.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found in Jeremiah chapter 29.

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:52.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah inspired Jeremiah
to convey his message to the Jews,

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had been taken from Jerusalem

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were captives in Babylon.

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:00.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were downhearted.

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even while in captivity,

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:05.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided a comforting message.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his words

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 29:10:

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,

00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:18.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will turn my attention to you.”

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God told these Jewish exiles

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would remain
in captivity for a long time.

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he made it clear to them
that he had a peaceful future in mind.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The latter part of that verse says:

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:36.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will make good my promise

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:38.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by bringing you back to this place.”

00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 11, he says:

00:06:40.783 --> 00:06:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I well know the thoughts

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I am thinking toward you,’

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and not of calamity,

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:53.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give you a future and a hope.’”

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:57.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God did make good
on his promise to those Israelites.

00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:02.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He let them know
that their future was to be a bright one.

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:06.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regarding Jeremiah 29:11,

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one commentary states:

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:14.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is difficult to find
a more wonderful promise

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“anywhere in Scripture
that expresses the tender compassion

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:21.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of Yahweh [Jehovah]

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:24.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“toward these exiles
and setting before them, at last,

00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:29.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a real reason for optimism and expectation.”

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promise strengthened men

00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:37.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah reassured the Jews
by repeating his promise

00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:45.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 31:17:

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there is a hope for your future . . .

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your sons will return
to their own territory.”

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure enough, just as Jehovah foretold,

00:07:58.294 --> 00:08:01.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Babylon was conquered
by the Persian King Cyrus,

00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:05.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who allowed the exiled Jews
to return to their homeland.

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:09.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After 70 years of captivity,

00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were back in Jerusalem.

00:08:11.507 --> 00:08:15.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah ‘made good on his promise.’

00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that have to do with us today?

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:24.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fulfilled promises of Jehovah assure us

00:08:24.854 --> 00:08:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his promises to us will come true

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of surrounding circumstances.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As he said: “I will make good my promise.”

00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:37.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting to know that!

00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that the greatest expression
of Jehovah’s comfort

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:47.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is his only-begotten Son, Jesus.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During his time on earth,
he gave people hope.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus engaged in a marvelous ministry

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—healing the sick, performing powerful works

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important,
teaching people about God’s Kingdom.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the greatest expression
of hope to us humans

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:11.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.

00:09:12.568 --> 00:09:15.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through his inspired Word,

00:09:15.238 --> 00:09:18.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that Jehovah assures us

00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:22.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he not only understands what we face

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:27.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also desires
to console and strengthen us.

00:09:27.617 --> 00:09:30.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loving heavenly Father

00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:34.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially watches over all
who endeavor to do his will.

00:09:34.123 --> 00:09:36.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in all of his mercy,

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he also draws humble people
who may not yet know him.

00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many of us were in dire straits

00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:47.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only to be introduced to the truth

00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:51.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to get to know Jehovah at the right time?

00:09:51.207 --> 00:09:53.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was no coincidence.

00:09:53.409 --> 00:09:56.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a consequence of Jehovah’s love

00:09:56.846 --> 00:10:01.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his desire to give people comfort
through the hope he provides.

00:10:03.452 --> 00:10:06.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:10:06.088 --> 00:10:10.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we get closer to the great tribulation,

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:13.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will face more distressing circumstances.

00:10:13.763 --> 00:10:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during the great tribulation,

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:19.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our trust in Jehovah must be solid.

00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be sensitive
and receptive to the ways

00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:25.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which he consoles and strengthens us.

00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to keep in mind what Paul says

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:31.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 1:4,

00:10:31.814 --> 00:10:34.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps even memorizing it.

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:36.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a God

00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:40.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who comforts us in all our trials.”

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:46.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time ago,
we interviewed two longtime members

00:10:46.462 --> 00:10:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the United States Bethel family:

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerald Grizzle,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:10:53.969 --> 00:10:56.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Sam Roberson.

00:10:56.339 --> 00:10:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These two brothers served
as traveling overseers

00:10:58.808 --> 00:11:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many years prior to coming to Bethel.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:06.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle has served
at Bethel since 1978,

00:11:06.148 --> 00:11:10.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Roberson
has served here for nearly 20 years.

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:13.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been assigned
by the Governing Body

00:11:13.322 --> 00:11:17.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist them in shepherding
the United States Bethel family.

00:11:17.893 --> 00:11:20.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Shepherding the Bethel family?’ you may ask.

00:11:20.296 --> 00:11:24.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘After all, Bethelites
don’t have any distressing trials!’

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:28.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to what our dear brothers have to say.

00:11:28.237 --> 00:11:31.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle,
what are some of the challenges

00:11:31.807 --> 00:11:34.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that members of the Bethel family face?

00:11:34.143 --> 00:11:36.812 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The worldwide Bethel family

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:41.584 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is a representation of the brotherhood.

00:11:41.584 --> 00:11:43.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By that I mean that

00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:47.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as 1 Peter 5:9 says,

00:11:47.923 --> 00:11:50.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they face ‘the same kind of sufferings

00:11:50.926 --> 00:11:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘being experienced by the entire association

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:56.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers in the world.’

00:11:56.465 --> 00:12:00.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some deal with serious health problems,

00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:03.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they continue to serve.

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:09.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have concerns over aging parents,

00:12:09.345 --> 00:12:14.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some have to give up
their beloved Bethel service.

00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:19.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still others contend
with bouts of depression.

00:12:19.622 --> 00:12:23.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the spirit
of these dear brothers and sisters

00:12:23.926 --> 00:12:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
impels them to have the determination

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to allow these challenges
to dominate them.

00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:34.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, their faith in Jehovah

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthens their resolve

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on their assignments.

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:41.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for that insight,

00:12:41.877 --> 00:12:43.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle.

00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:48.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Roberson, how have you been able
to comfort such ones?

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.986 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When we find out a Bethelite

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:53.022 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is going through a tragedy,

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.324 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there are four things that we do.

00:12:55.324 --> 00:12:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one, we pray for them

00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:01.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and develop specific spiritual points

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to their needs.

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s before we make the call.

00:13:07.136 --> 00:13:10.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two, when we actually make the call,

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we really listen.

00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:14.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t mean
we just listen with our ears.

00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:17.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to listen with our hearts.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to feel what they feel.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to have compassion.

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:28.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three, when we use God’s Word

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remind them
they’re not facing their crisis alone,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is very effective.

00:13:33.362 --> 00:13:36.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
we called on a brother recently

00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:39.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was going through a great trial,

00:13:39.134 --> 00:13:41.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we shared, among other things,

00:13:41.136 --> 00:13:45.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 3:7, 12.

00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:47.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look at that:

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:50.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have certainly seen the affliction

00:13:50.312 --> 00:13:52.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of my people who are in Egypt,

00:13:52.815 --> 00:13:54.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I have heard their outcry

00:13:54.817 --> 00:13:57.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of those who force them to work.”

00:13:57.887 --> 00:14:02.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And note the ending point here
—it’s very beautiful.

00:14:02.224 --> 00:14:07.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t say,
‘I know how my people feel’;

00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:09.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says: “I <i>well </i> know

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the pains [of my people].”

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:15.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in giving assurance

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dealing with Moses
fearing to go before Pharaoh,

00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:22.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 12, just the <i>A</i>  part:

00:14:22.378 --> 00:14:27.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To this he said:
‘I will prove to be with you.’”

00:14:28.484 --> 00:14:31.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just a few words but so powerful,

00:14:31.587 --> 00:14:34.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah is guaranteeing

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s going to give them undeniable proof

00:14:39.595 --> 00:14:44.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s backing them up
and never moving away from them one inch.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this gives us comfort.

00:14:46.602 --> 00:14:48.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, number four,

00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:51.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we conclude the call,

00:14:51.574 --> 00:14:54.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have an ending prayer with them.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we use their names,

00:14:56.512 --> 00:14:59.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is very comforting
since we’re calling on Jehovah,

00:14:59.949 --> 00:15:01.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Great Shepherd.

00:15:01.951 --> 00:15:04.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Thessalonians 5:14,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “We urge you, brothers, to . . .

00:15:07.222 --> 00:15:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“speak consolingly to those
who are depressed,

00:15:10.626 --> 00:15:14.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[to] support the weak,
be patient toward all.”

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is exactly what we’re trying to do.

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:21.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for sharing those thoughts
—very interesting.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers Grizzle and Roberson:

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has comforting others affected you?

00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:29.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle first, please.

00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:32.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During these challenging times,

00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:36.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sense Jehovah’s love for his people.

00:15:36.952 --> 00:15:38.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,

00:15:38.954 --> 00:15:43.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen and experienced his care

00:15:43.092 --> 00:15:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when facing difficult times.

00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:48.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago,

00:15:48.631 --> 00:15:52.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my mother, my brother,

00:15:52.968 --> 00:15:57.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my father in death all within a year.

00:15:57.973 --> 00:16:00.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 2017,

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my dear wife, Bonnie,

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:07.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after we had served Jehovah together

00:16:07.082 --> 00:16:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for nearly 65 years.

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:12.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with much prayer,

00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:16.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
research, and love of the friends,

00:16:16.358 --> 00:16:19.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has comforted me.

00:16:19.094 --> 00:16:21.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, thankfully,

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been able
to offer encouragement to others.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very touching, Brother Grizzle,

00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:26.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thank you.

00:16:28.003 --> 00:16:31.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Roberson,
how has comforting others

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:33.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affected you?

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most memorable challenges

00:16:35.611 --> 00:16:37.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was while my wife, Linda, and I
were in the circuit work

00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several years ago.

00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:42.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my voice.

00:16:42.284 --> 00:16:45.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to have surgery on my vocal cords,

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:48.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for six weeks, I could not talk.

00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:52.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a circuit overseer,
that’s like being a bird without its wings.

00:16:53.862 --> 00:16:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote more notes in that six weeks

00:16:57.066 --> 00:17:00.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than I had written in my whole life!

00:17:00.002 --> 00:17:04.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in spite of that
and along with other situations and tragedies

00:17:04.673 --> 00:17:07.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we faced similar to Gerald’s,

00:17:07.376 --> 00:17:10.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has seen us through them all.

00:17:10.312 --> 00:17:12.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let me say, it’s been a real pleasure

00:17:12.715 --> 00:17:16.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share Jehovah’s comfort with so many.

00:17:16.385 --> 00:17:19.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do,
we see the Governing Body’s interest

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:21.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all of Jehovah’s people,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including those with added responsibility.

00:17:24.927 --> 00:17:28.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They truly reflect Jehovah’s feelings

00:17:28.097 --> 00:17:30.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the God of all comfort.”

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:33.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you, brothers.

00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:35.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciate your comments.

00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:39.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And more than the shepherding that you do

00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:42.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the example that you have set

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in enduring trials,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in experiencing Jehovah’s comfort,

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in comforting others.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much.

00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:55.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body has instituted
similar shepherding arrangements

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:58.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in branch offices around the world.

00:18:00.796 --> 00:18:04.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we want to talk
to some of you in our audience.

00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:09.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of stresses, disappointments,

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:13.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hurt feelings caused by fellow believers,

00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:17.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some have strayed
from Jehovah’s organization.

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:20.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others may have been removed
from the congregation

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:23.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now would like to return.

00:18:23.452 --> 00:18:25.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To you we say:

00:18:25.687 --> 00:18:29.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Allow Jehovah to comfort and strengthen you.

00:18:29.391 --> 00:18:34.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants you to draw close to him,
and he will help you.”

00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:38.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 4:8 says:

00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:41.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Draw close to God,

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will draw close to you.”

00:18:45.174 --> 00:18:49.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has great care for such ones.

00:18:49.144 --> 00:18:51.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what he says

00:18:51.146 --> 00:18:56.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ezekiel 34:16:

00:18:56.084 --> 00:19:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The stray I will bring back,

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:03.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the injured I will bandage,

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:06.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the weak I will strengthen.”

00:19:06.695 --> 00:19:08.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who have recovered have said

00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that one of the most
difficult things for them to do

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to cross the threshold
of the Kingdom Hall.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember, it’s Jehovah who bandages you,

00:19:19.341 --> 00:19:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his sheep, helping you to heal.

00:19:23.145 --> 00:19:27.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same chapter, in verse 12, he says:

00:19:27.516 --> 00:19:31.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will care for my sheep . . . 

00:19:31.987 --> 00:19:35.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will rescue them from all the places

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they were scattered.”

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:43.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In imitation of that love,
the faithful slave says,

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:47.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We view you as lost sheep,

00:19:47.202 --> 00:19:49.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not a lost cause.”

00:19:50.505 --> 00:19:52.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To all we say,

00:19:52.507 --> 00:19:55.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No matter what you face, remember:

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In difficult times,

00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:00.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always comforts.”

00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:05.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout our program,
we’ll hear experiences

00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:10.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of brothers and sisters
who were comforted by Jehovah.

00:20:10.092 --> 00:20:12.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they share their stories,

00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for all the ways Jehovah helped them

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and consider how you can help others.

00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:21.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First is the experience of Maombi Vianney.

00:25:23.838 --> 00:25:26.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re suffering some kind of trial

00:25:26.741 --> 00:25:29.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re searching for God,

00:25:29.344 --> 00:25:32.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be encouraged by Maombi’s story.

00:25:32.514 --> 00:25:34.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows your struggles,

00:25:34.849 --> 00:25:37.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he draws all deserving ones to him.

00:25:39.087 --> 00:25:41.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that Maombi,

00:25:41.156 --> 00:25:43.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having received comfort,

00:25:43.158 --> 00:25:45.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was moved to help others?

00:25:45.994 --> 00:25:47.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our next segment,

00:25:47.996 --> 00:25:52.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see just how powerful
the love of our brothers and sisters can be.

00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:12.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
LaQuita worked
for the City of Virginia Beach.

00:26:12.721 --> 00:26:16.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the city, she was able to get a schedule

00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:20.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that allowed her to focus on her ministry.

00:26:22.397 --> 00:26:25.133 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I came home on a Friday.

00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:27.769 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Both my mother and I had

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:29.571 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
doctors’ appointments that day.

00:26:30.305 --> 00:26:32.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we came home and sat down,

00:26:32.407 --> 00:26:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting ready to fix us a bite of lunch,

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I got a phone call.

00:26:37.445 --> 00:26:40.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a family member,

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:44.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were asking me
if I had seen the news.

00:26:44.219 --> 00:26:47.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I immediately

00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:49.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tried to call my daughter’s phone,

00:26:50.525 --> 00:26:52.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it went straight to voice mail.

00:26:52.927 --> 00:26:56.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I said, “Well, let me try texting her.”

00:26:56.298 --> 00:26:58.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I tried texting her,

00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:01.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t get any response.

00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:05.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was about 10:00 or 10:30

00:27:07.342 --> 00:27:10.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that night when we just finally
got the confirmation

00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:14.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had indeed lost her in that shooting.

00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:20.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I will say,
that was the worst day of my life.

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:26.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

00:27:28.129 --> 00:27:31.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting at seven o’clock in the morning,

00:27:31.533 --> 00:27:33.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
friends started pouring in,

00:27:33.868 --> 00:27:35.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people in our home

00:27:39.407 --> 00:27:41.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support us and encourage us

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from morning till night.

00:27:50.018 --> 00:27:52.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it meant so much.

00:27:54.556 --> 00:27:58.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped us to focus

00:27:58.526 --> 00:28:01.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on something else at that time.

00:28:01.796 --> 00:28:06.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love that they showed to us
—it was just astounding.

00:28:06.234 --> 00:28:08.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just so amazing.

00:28:08.336 --> 00:28:12.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what helped us to get through,

00:28:12.574 --> 00:28:14.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get through it all

00:28:14.743 --> 00:28:18.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was our family, our spiritual family.

00:28:25.854 --> 00:28:29.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The City of Virginia Beach, they volunteered

00:28:29.324 --> 00:28:32.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take care of all
of the victims’ arrangements.

00:28:36.064 --> 00:28:38.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the amount of people,

00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:41.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the venue that they decided upon

00:28:42.237 --> 00:28:44.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the opera house in Norfolk.

00:28:45.407 --> 00:28:48.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers, they got everything together.

00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:53.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The city didn’t really have to do anything;
they just gave us the venue.

00:28:53.181 --> 00:28:55.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what really impressed them,

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the city, was that

00:28:58.553 --> 00:29:03.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the whole memorial, everything,

00:29:03.057 --> 00:29:05.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took place within an hour.

00:29:05.627 --> 00:29:08.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The city officials were there in attendance.

00:29:08.096 --> 00:29:10.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had the local newspapers

00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:13.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who covered it, reporters.

00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:15.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reporters

00:29:15.203 --> 00:29:19.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were persistent in wanting to talk,

00:29:19.107 --> 00:29:23.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so actually two of my brothers,

00:29:23.077 --> 00:29:25.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they handled all of that information,

00:29:25.246 --> 00:29:29.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the guidance
from those two brothers who came down.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:33.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It kept us from having
to even worry about that, you know, 

00:29:33.755 --> 00:29:36.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it was very helpful.

00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:38.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I continue to get cards;

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get texts from people,

00:29:42.163 --> 00:29:46.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just encourages me.

00:29:46.768 --> 00:29:50.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 41:10

00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:52.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that has become my favorite scripture.

00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:55.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:29:55.877 --> 00:29:58.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:29:59.314 --> 00:30:01.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going through this,

00:30:01.316 --> 00:30:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could really feel Jehovah’s hand.

00:30:04.953 --> 00:30:09.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if he was rubbing my shoulders

00:30:09.924 --> 00:30:13.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saying: ‘It’s going to be all right.

00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:15.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You’ll be all right.

00:30:15.096 --> 00:30:17.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to get you through this.’

00:30:17.732 --> 00:30:19.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has.

00:30:21.369 --> 00:30:24.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each day he gets me through this.

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:28.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it can happen to someone else,
it can happen to me.

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:30.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this instance, it did.

00:30:30.645 --> 00:30:32.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helps me to keep a perspective,

00:30:36.985 --> 00:30:40.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I reflect on how Jehovah

00:30:40.188 --> 00:30:42.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to reverse it.

00:30:42.991 --> 00:30:46.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my biggest hope

00:30:46.227 --> 00:30:49.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to see Jehovah reverse

00:30:49.664 --> 00:30:51.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:55.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s promised it, and my faith

00:30:55.203 --> 00:30:58.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in the fulfillment of his promises.

00:30:58.706 --> 00:31:03.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I look forward to being reunited
with my daughter.

Isaiah 43:2 says, in part:

00:31:09.517 --> 00:31:13.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you pass through the waters,
I will be with you,

00:31:13.688 --> 00:31:17.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and through the rivers,
they will not flood over you.”

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tragic and unforeseen things

00:31:21.663 --> 00:31:24.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can befall faithful servants of Jehovah.

00:31:24.832 --> 00:31:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may suffer terribly,
but we are not destroyed.

00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:33.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will always belong to Jehovah,

00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:35.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father of tender mercies.”

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is always there for us,

00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:41.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we all lead such busy lives.

00:31:41.516 --> 00:31:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new music video vividly shows
the blessings we receive

00:31:45.853 --> 00:31:48.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we make time for Jehovah.

00:31:53.227 --> 00:32:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So much to do
And so few hours in our day,

00:32:01.869 --> 00:32:09.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to steal away
moments to pray.

00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:18.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have got to
find a way to . . .

00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:27.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time for Jehovah.
Make him part of your life.

00:32:29.864 --> 00:32:34.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let life in this world
draw you away.

00:32:39.207 --> 00:32:44.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time for Jehovah.

00:32:46.648 --> 00:32:56.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends grow close
When words from the heart are shared.

00:32:56.057 --> 00:33:03.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we share
and see that he cares?

00:33:03.631 --> 00:33:12.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will we know that he’s there
Unless we . . .

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:21.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time for Jehovah.
Make him part of your life.

00:33:24.152 --> 00:33:29.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let life in this world
draw you away.

00:33:32.994 --> 00:33:37.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time for Jehovah.

00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:47.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time
To see his hand in our life.

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:53.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time
To see ourselves in Paradise.

00:33:58.219 --> 00:34:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let nothing
get in our way.

00:34:09.197 --> 00:34:11.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:34:12.066 --> 00:34:14.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:34:15.002 --> 00:34:18.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make the time.

00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:31.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time for Jehovah.
Make him part of your life.

00:34:33.087 --> 00:34:38.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let life in this world
draw you away.

00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:47.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time for Jehovah.

00:34:54.542 --> 00:35:00.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:11.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:24.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:35:30.878 --> 00:35:35.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:35:36.984 --> 00:35:41.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:35:42.723 --> 00:35:48.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:35:48.796 --> 00:35:51.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make time.

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:08.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make time to see his hand in our life.”

00:36:08.516 --> 00:36:10.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful expression!

00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:15.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you your harshest critic?

00:36:15.022 --> 00:36:18.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be discouraged
by our own shortcomings or failures

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—real or imagined.

00:36:21.495 --> 00:36:25.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what can help
in the latest episode of our series

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Apply Bible Principles.”

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:40.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was growing up,
my parents always used to say:

00:36:40.348 --> 00:36:42.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pray about your spiritual goals.

00:36:45.319 --> 00:36:47.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Work hard.

00:36:49.724 --> 00:36:53.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then let Jehovah do the rest.”

00:36:57.365 --> 00:36:59.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what I did.

00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:05.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wow, did Jehovah pour out the blessings!

00:37:07.308 --> 00:37:10.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even got invited
to a branch construction project.

00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:14.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was pretty excited

00:37:14.215 --> 00:37:15.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at first.

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:19.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get me wrong.

00:37:19.353 --> 00:37:22.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a privilege to be there,

00:37:22.089 --> 00:37:25.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the work was harder
than I thought it would be.

00:37:29.864 --> 00:37:32.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were a lot of new skills to learn.

00:37:34.101 --> 00:37:38.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have to admit,
I really wanted to impress my overseer.

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:42.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I pushed hard,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe a little too hard.

00:37:51.585 --> 00:37:53.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see all that up there?

00:37:53.621 --> 00:37:55.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That all needs to come down.

00:37:55.256 --> 00:37:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:37:55.923 --> 00:37:57.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think you can wrap this up
before tomorrow?

00:37:57.959 --> 00:38:00.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure thing. I’m on it.

00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:03.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can grab Jin and Young
to give you a hand with the lift.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jin’s a pro; he’ll help you out.

00:38:05.232 --> 00:38:06.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Got it.

00:38:07.802 --> 00:38:10.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The job didn’t look that hard.

00:38:10.237 --> 00:38:13.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, I mean, I had the training.

00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:16.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if I had waited for them,

00:38:16.644 --> 00:38:19.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no way
we were going to get this done today.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:01.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is, I had caused some real damage,

00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:03.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I made more work for everyone.

00:39:06.127 --> 00:39:08.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ian, are you OK?

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:10.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I’m fine.

00:39:10.498 --> 00:39:12.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a minute to talk in my office?

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like such a loser.

00:39:30.184 --> 00:39:33.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers talked to me,
and they were nice about it.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was still left thinking:

00:39:35.656 --> 00:39:37.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What am I doing here?

00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:39.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I should just go home.’

00:39:40.828 --> 00:39:42.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 3:2 says:

00:39:42.663 --> 00:39:46.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we all stumble many times.”

00:39:46.867 --> 00:39:48.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the real question is,

00:39:48.869 --> 00:39:52.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we stumble
—and it is going to happen—

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should we do then?

00:39:56.544 --> 00:39:58.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jake.

00:40:00.014 --> 00:40:03.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when Dad was teaching me
to ride my bike,

00:40:03.517 --> 00:40:05.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I fell a lot.

00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:06.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was hard.

00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:10.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I just kept getting up and trying again.

00:40:10.357 --> 00:40:14.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now I can ride pretty fast!

00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:17.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you just have to get back up
when you fall.

00:40:17.364 --> 00:40:20.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, that’s right!
That was a great comment.

00:40:21.569 --> 00:40:24.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, Jake, that’s it!

00:40:24.738 --> 00:40:28.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to swallow my pride
and just get back up.

00:40:35.015 --> 00:40:37.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized I needed to be more focused

00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:41.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the seriousness of my assignment
and not so focused on myself.

00:40:44.558 --> 00:40:47.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of trying to do
everything myself,

00:40:47.895 --> 00:40:50.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I set more realistic expectations

00:40:50.464 --> 00:40:53.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what I could do and what I couldn’t.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a lot to learn.

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:02.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I kept working and learning.

00:41:04.912 --> 00:41:07.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after a while,

00:41:07.314 --> 00:41:11.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even got to help train
some of the new volunteers.

00:41:13.053 --> 00:41:16.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, I was so thankful to Jehovah

00:41:16.323 --> 00:41:20.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for helping me understand
that in the race for life,

00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:23.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of us are going to cross the finish line
without stumbling.

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The important thing
is to get back up and just keep going.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some hesitate to draw close to people

00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:38.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of different races or nationalities.

00:41:38.112 --> 00:41:42.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they can overcome this
by imitating Jehovah’s impartiality.

00:41:42.049 --> 00:41:43.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result?

00:41:43.784 --> 00:41:45.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great joy.

00:41:45.786 --> 00:41:48.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see an example
of this in the following report.

00:41:55.396 --> 00:41:58.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On September 18, 2020,

00:41:58.232 --> 00:41:59.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Medicane Ianos,

00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:03.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a rare Mediterranean cyclone, struck Greece

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and flooded a Roma settlement in Mavrika,

00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:08.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just outside the city of Karditsa.

00:42:11.078 --> 00:42:14.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Local authorities worked
alongside emergency services to evacuate

00:42:14.682 --> 00:42:17.151 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
over 1,000 Roma who lived there.

00:42:17.151 --> 00:42:18.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But a family of seven

00:42:18.752 --> 00:42:20.821 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who are studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:42:20.821 --> 00:42:22.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were left behind.

00:42:24.191 --> 00:42:25.960 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was raining hard,

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the floodwaters were rising quickly.

00:42:28.329 --> 00:42:29.997 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I took my wife by the hand

00:42:29.997 --> 00:42:32.266 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and carried my child on my back.

00:42:32.266 --> 00:42:36.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With great difficulty, we managed
to make it to a neighboring house.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:39.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were unable to contact the authorities.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were terrified
and had no option but to stay there.

00:42:42.876 --> 00:42:45.546 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know what to do.

00:42:45.546 --> 00:42:47.815 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were so scared and worried.

00:42:47.815 --> 00:42:49.450 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We had never experienced

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:51.151 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
anything like this before.

00:42:51.151 --> 00:42:53.821 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The floodwaters had risen a lot,

00:42:53.821 --> 00:42:56.523 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we stood waiting for hours.

00:42:56.523 --> 00:42:59.159 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I asked my father to pray for us.

00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:02.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did many times.

00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:06.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were lots of people in the house,
both young and old.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were afraid, and they were crying.

00:43:14.808 --> 00:43:19.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Video messages from the family
started to come through, asking for help.

00:43:19.546 --> 00:43:21.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could see their fear.

00:43:21.548 --> 00:43:23.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to help them,

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:27.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was no way for us to go there
because access was impossible.

00:43:28.922 --> 00:43:31.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we could do was pray to Jehovah for them

00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:33.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send messages of encouragement.

00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:36.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very distressed.

00:43:36.964 --> 00:43:38.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children were crying.

00:43:38.966 --> 00:43:42.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,
begging him for peace of mind.

00:43:42.936 --> 00:43:46.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I threw all of my burdens
and anxiety of my heart on Jehovah.

00:43:46.807 --> 00:43:51.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, I felt calm and had no anxiety.

00:43:51.278 --> 00:43:56.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt his spirit giving me strength
during the hours that followed until dawn.

00:44:12.299 --> 00:44:14.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The situation was very difficult.

00:44:14.868 --> 00:44:16.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had suffered a lot,

00:44:16.303 --> 00:44:18.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their clothes were dirty.

00:44:18.339 --> 00:44:19.873 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There was no way

00:44:19.873 --> 00:44:21.709 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I could leave them there.

00:44:23.077 --> 00:44:25.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were given a house to stay in.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to calm down and sleep.

00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:31.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers gave us food.

00:44:31.919 --> 00:44:35.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thanked Jehovah for teaching us
and taking care of us.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is our Savior.

00:44:40.728 --> 00:44:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I attended the first meeting
after the flood, I felt calm again.

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:49.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to keep my routine as normal:

00:44:49.002 --> 00:44:53.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
study, meetings, preparing comments.

00:44:53.974 --> 00:44:56.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt joy and contentment.

00:44:56.443 --> 00:45:01.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My legal documents, such as my ID,
were saved from the flood.

00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:04.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our neighbors were not prepared.

00:45:04.017 --> 00:45:06.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we, thanks to Jehovah’s direction,

00:45:06.286 --> 00:45:08.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had packed emergency bags.

00:45:09.289 --> 00:45:13.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About a week later,
we were able to return to Mavrika.

00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:16.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The houses were in terrible condition,
full of mud.

00:45:18.365 --> 00:45:22.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Disaster Relief Committee
helped us immediately.

00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:26.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers from 300 kilometers (190 mi) away
sent emergency supplies.

00:45:27.708 --> 00:45:31.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brotherhood showed us love in practice.

00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They worked hard
and helped us because they love us.

00:45:34.948 --> 00:45:37.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was deeply touched and found myself in awe.

00:45:37.718 --> 00:45:39.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are united.

00:45:39.386 --> 00:45:43.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this brought
glory and praise to Jehovah.

00:45:44.858 --> 00:45:48.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we went there to help,
the Roma neighbors were very surprised.

00:45:48.862 --> 00:45:51.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked if we could help them too.

00:45:51.231 --> 00:45:56.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We replied that we have to help
our family first, our brothers.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were very puzzled
that we called our Roma brothers family

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since we were not from their tribe.

00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:08.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 4:16 finds a good application
in this story.

00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:12.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as every joint in the body offers help,

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so did the brothers.

00:46:16.056 --> 00:46:18.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all worked together

00:46:18.091 --> 00:46:21.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide help to our brothers in need.

00:46:23.063 --> 00:46:26.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is teaching me and helping me.

00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:28.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really trust in him.

00:46:28.168 --> 00:46:30.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has blessed me personally.

00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:33.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen how good he is to me.

00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:37.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a miserable world, Jehovah brings me joy.

00:46:37.277 --> 00:46:41.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that he chooses
according to a person’s heart.

00:46:41.215 --> 00:46:44.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All glory belongs to Jehovah!

00:46:48.489 --> 00:46:50.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In total,

00:46:50.324 --> 00:46:53.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seven members of the Tsakiris family
are studying the Bible.

00:46:53.927 --> 00:46:55.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five, who are deaf,

00:46:55.929 --> 00:46:58.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are studying
with a Greek Sign Language group.

00:46:59.132 --> 00:47:01.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the flood struck,

00:47:01.134 --> 00:47:05.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 20 people,
including the Tsakiris family,

00:47:05.005 --> 00:47:08.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could not be evacuated
because of strong currents.

00:47:08.342 --> 00:47:13.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, other Roma who had been left behind
blamed the flood on the family

00:47:13.113 --> 00:47:16.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were all studying
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:21.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after they observed the assistance
provided by the brothers and sisters,

00:47:21.822 --> 00:47:25.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they said:
“You have the true religion.

00:47:25.459 --> 00:47:27.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You show genuine love.”

00:47:29.496 --> 00:47:32.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our series “My Teen Life”

00:47:32.499 --> 00:47:34.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped many young Witnesses

00:47:34.701 --> 00:47:37.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
navigate today’s realities.

00:47:37.671 --> 00:47:42.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our next episode has to do with association,

00:47:42.009 --> 00:47:44.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll hear from a brother and a sister

00:47:44.478 --> 00:47:46.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who eventually made good decisions

00:47:46.547 --> 00:47:49.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the help of Bible principles.

00:47:49.182 --> 00:47:51.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That may not surprise you.

00:47:51.485 --> 00:47:55.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we’re looking for in this is “how.”

00:47:55.756 --> 00:48:00.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they go from knowing Bible principles
to applying them?

00:48:11.238 --> 00:48:13.307 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My parents were both Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:14.875 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by the time I was born.

00:48:14.875 --> 00:48:16.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I studied the Bible,

00:48:16.877 --> 00:48:19.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended meetings,
and went out in service with them.

00:48:21.615 --> 00:48:23.717 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in the truth, I knew

00:48:23.717 --> 00:48:26.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that living by Bible standards
is what’s best for me.

00:48:26.753 --> 00:48:28.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my parents were always so zealous

00:48:28.855 --> 00:48:31.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it came to spiritual things.

00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:33.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I think back,

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t want to let them down.

00:48:36.463 --> 00:48:39.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following Bible principles is not burdensome

00:48:39.733 --> 00:48:41.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even that difficult.

00:48:42.402 --> 00:48:46.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, if we do as it says in the Bible,
then we benefit ourselves.

00:48:47.074 --> 00:48:49.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times, I was curious

00:48:49.743 --> 00:48:52.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how my life would be
if I wasn’t in the truth.

00:48:52.946 --> 00:48:56.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just so fun
to be around my school friends.

00:48:56.783 --> 00:49:00.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overall, I had a good time at school.

00:49:00.621 --> 00:49:03.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got along with my classmates, 
and my teachers liked me too.

00:49:03.991 --> 00:49:07.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So being in school
was a pretty good experience.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:12.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents always told me
not to get too close to my classmates,

00:49:12.099 --> 00:49:14.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in my opinion, my friends

00:49:14.267 --> 00:49:17.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had good conduct and were good people.

00:49:17.137 --> 00:49:20.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t understand why they were so worried.

00:49:20.107 --> 00:49:22.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my high school,

00:49:22.075 --> 00:49:24.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were a lot of kids who went to church

00:49:24.978 --> 00:49:27.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of the teachers
had religious backgrounds.

00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:31.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, there was an incident
when the entire school found out

00:49:31.952 --> 00:49:34.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:49:34.154 --> 00:49:36.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that some people might be prejudiced

00:49:36.323 --> 00:49:39.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Witnesses, but I was surprised

00:49:39.026 --> 00:49:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how everyone could change so suddenly.

00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:45.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started spending more time
with my classmates,

00:49:45.832 --> 00:49:48.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the more I hung out with them,
the more I saw

00:49:48.135 --> 00:49:51.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we were living
completely different lives.

00:49:51.004 --> 00:49:54.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their conversations would be
about trips they went on over the weekend

00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:56.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what they bought
on their latest shopping trip, 

00:49:57.544 --> 00:50:00.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when it came to me,
all I had done was spiritual activities.

00:50:00.814 --> 00:50:03.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like I was missing out.

00:50:03.817 --> 00:50:07.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt alone and like an outcast.

00:50:07.387 --> 00:50:11.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew in my head that Bible principles
are right and beneficial,

00:50:11.758 --> 00:50:14.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when I was
actually put in that situation,

00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:16.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t so sure anymore.

00:50:18.331 --> 00:50:22.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to feel like I wasn’t as cool
as my classmates,

00:50:22.502 --> 00:50:24.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so when they started to talk
about their life goals,

00:50:24.838 --> 00:50:28.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t bring myself to tell them
what my goals were.

00:50:28.742 --> 00:50:31.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I started thinking,

00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:34.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What would be the right way for me to act?’

00:50:34.681 --> 00:50:38.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Opening up to my parents
about my situation really helped.

00:50:38.585 --> 00:50:41.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day for family worship, we decided

00:50:41.688 --> 00:50:44.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discuss that topic.

00:50:44.024 --> 00:50:46.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read Matthew 5:11:

00:50:46.526 --> 00:50:50.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are you when people reproach you
and persecute you

00:50:50.597 --> 00:50:52.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

00:50:52.699 --> 00:50:54.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against you for my sake.”

00:50:55.368 --> 00:50:58.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can you be happy when persecuted?

00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:02.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought to myself,
‘But I’m not happy right now.’

00:51:02.242 --> 00:51:05.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom shared Mark 8:38 with me.

00:51:05.779 --> 00:51:07.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The part in the scripture where it says

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we are ashamed of Jesus Christ,

00:51:09.382 --> 00:51:11.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will be ashamed of us

00:51:11.418 --> 00:51:13.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really hit me.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that deep inside

00:51:15.722 --> 00:51:17.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had been ashamed of being a Witness.

00:51:18.391 --> 00:51:19.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While I was going through all of this,

00:51:19.926 --> 00:51:23.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother gave
a public talk in our congregation

00:51:23.196 --> 00:51:26.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read Matthew 19:29.

00:51:26.366 --> 00:51:28.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says that everyone who has left

00:51:28.869 --> 00:51:31.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is important to them
“for the sake of [Jehovah]

00:51:31.805 --> 00:51:34.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will receive a hundred times as much.”

00:51:34.641 --> 00:51:39.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to try leaving
what I thought was important to me

00:51:39.012 --> 00:51:42.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing what results
and blessings I might receive.

00:51:42.315 --> 00:51:44.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About that time,

00:51:44.317 --> 00:51:47.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents helped me to associate
with brothers and sisters

00:51:47.254 --> 00:51:51.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were participating
in many different forms of full-time service

00:51:51.324 --> 00:51:53.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could hear their experiences.

00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:55.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That helped me to decide

00:51:55.996 --> 00:51:58.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which direction I wanted to go in my life.

00:51:58.799 --> 00:52:02.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing that was really great
about this decision

00:52:02.068 --> 00:52:05.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that I was able to meet
many new brothers and sisters.

00:52:05.806 --> 00:52:08.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that there were so many people

00:52:08.608 --> 00:52:11.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had the same thoughts and goals as I did.

00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:14.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were my true friends.

00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:17.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time the topic of our future goals
came up with my classmates,

00:52:17.951 --> 00:52:20.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to speak up confidently.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am really thankful to my parents

00:52:22.489 --> 00:52:24.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who helped me to find the courage to do that.

00:52:24.791 --> 00:52:29.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve felt that Jehovah
truly keeps his promises.

00:52:29.029 --> 00:52:31.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come to think of it,

00:52:31.097 --> 00:52:33.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has kept his promise to reward me

00:52:33.733 --> 00:52:35.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a hundred times as much

00:52:35.869 --> 00:52:39.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I choose to live
by the Bible’s principles.

00:52:41.041 --> 00:52:43.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am really happy now,

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:47.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am confident that if I follow
the Bible’s teachings when I make decisions,

00:52:47.914 --> 00:52:51.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will always have the best results.

00:53:04.631 --> 00:53:07.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were familiar with the Bible.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But its value became real to them

00:53:10.103 --> 00:53:13.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they put Bible principles into practice.

00:53:15.775 --> 00:53:20.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s program underscored
that in difficult times,

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always comforts.

00:53:23.717 --> 00:53:27.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Servants of Jehovah
like Sister Brown and her daughter

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may suffer terrible blows.

00:53:31.124 --> 00:53:34.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter what happens to us,
even “if we die,

00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:38.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we [always] belong to Jehovah.”

00:53:38.365 --> 00:53:40.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible truths were a comfort to Maombi,

00:53:40.634 --> 00:53:44.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 who never gave up searching for God.

00:53:44.437 --> 00:53:48.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, all of us provide comfort

00:53:48.441 --> 00:53:50.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we show impartial love.

00:53:52.045 --> 00:53:54.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s time for our video postcard.

00:53:55.415 --> 00:53:58.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month we visit our brothers in Alaska.

00:54:01.388 --> 00:54:05.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alaska is in the far northwest corner
of North America.

00:54:06.126 --> 00:54:08.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One third of it lies
within the Arctic Circle.

00:54:08.395 --> 00:54:11.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some areas, temperatures can drop

00:54:11.464 --> 00:54:14.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
below negative 60 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:54:14.367 --> 00:54:16.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or negative 54 degrees Celsius.

00:54:17.871 --> 00:54:21.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a sparsely populated land
of glaciers,

00:54:21.408 --> 00:54:23.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
permafrost, and tundra

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:25.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is a rich habitat

00:54:25.178 --> 00:54:27.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for bears, caribou,

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:31.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moose, whales,
and dozens of species of fish.

00:54:31.985 --> 00:54:35.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit the Kuskokwim Congregation
in Bethel, Alaska.

00:54:36.056 --> 00:54:38.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right
—the village is named Bethel!

00:54:38.758 --> 00:54:41.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty-two publishers preach
in a territory that includes

00:54:41.494 --> 00:54:45.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
13 villages connected by waterways.

00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:48.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the weather and seasons change,

00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:50.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so does their choice of transportation.

00:54:51.738 --> 00:54:53.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Four-wheelers and snowmobiles are common

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since many villages lack roads and cars.

00:54:57.577 --> 00:55:01.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This “road”
is actually on top of a frozen river.

00:55:01.815 --> 00:55:03.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a caravan of publishers

00:55:03.817 --> 00:55:06.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on their way to the village of Kwethluk.

00:55:06.119 --> 00:55:10.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be safe,
brothers travel with two or more vehicles

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:13.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in case one gets stuck or breaks down.

00:55:13.493 --> 00:55:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daily sunlight varies with the seasons

00:55:16.096 --> 00:55:18.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from less than 6 hours during winter

00:55:18.798 --> 00:55:22.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to more than 19 during summer.

00:55:22.268 --> 00:55:24.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation includes

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:28.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nine regular and five special pioneers.

00:55:28.041 --> 00:55:30.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An average of 85 Bible studies

00:55:30.877 --> 00:55:33.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are conducted every month.

00:55:33.013 --> 00:55:35.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to an English congregation,

00:55:35.615 --> 00:55:37.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is a Yupik pregroup.

00:55:38.451 --> 00:55:41.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dog sledding
is an important part of Yupik culture.

00:55:41.788 --> 00:55:44.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several races are held here every year.

00:55:45.191 --> 00:55:47.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This Bible student is wearing

00:55:47.193 --> 00:55:49.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a traditional garment called a qaspeq.

00:55:49.729 --> 00:55:53.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many at the meetings
give their comments in Yupik

00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:55.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have them translated into English.

00:55:55.835 --> 00:55:59.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although most publishers
aren’t fluent in Yupik,

00:55:59.139 --> 00:56:01.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they use publications and videos

00:56:01.174 --> 00:56:04.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
translated into Yupik
in the ministry.

00:56:04.044 --> 00:56:06.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baptisms are normally held

00:56:06.079 --> 00:56:09.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at conventions and assemblies
in the city of Anchorage.

00:56:09.416 --> 00:56:12.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this Bible student
made her dedication to Jehovah

00:56:12.485 --> 00:56:14.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:56:14.888 --> 00:56:17.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the frigid weather,

00:56:17.257 --> 00:56:19.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was baptized in this river.

00:56:19.659 --> 00:56:21.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is where she grew up.

00:56:21.661 --> 00:56:24.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
from the Kuskokwim Congregation

00:56:24.697 --> 00:56:26.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Bethel, Alaska

00:56:26.699 --> 00:56:28.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their love and greetings

00:56:28.701 --> 00:56:30.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood!

00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:34.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:56:34.974 --> 00:56:37.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
