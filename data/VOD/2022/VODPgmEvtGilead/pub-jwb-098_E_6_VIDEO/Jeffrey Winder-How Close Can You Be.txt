00:00:01 How would you students answer this question:
00:00:05 Do you feel closer to Jehovah now
00:00:08 than you did before your Gilead training began?
00:00:13 The answer is a resounding yes, isn’t it?
00:00:17 Maybe you can relate to these comments
00:00:20 of graduates of past classes of Gilead.
00:00:23 One brother said: “Absolutely, yes!
00:00:27 “I believe I now experience more fully
00:00:30 “what it means to walk with God
00:00:33 “and know and rely upon him as a close Friend,
00:00:36 not merely someone I turn and look up to in prayer.”
00:00:41 A sister said: “Gilead definitely drew me closer to Jehovah.
00:00:46 “The way we studied the Scriptures with intensity
00:00:49 truly made me feel like the Bible was a letter Jehovah wrote to me.”
00:00:56 Another brother said: “Jehovah communicated with such clarity,
00:01:01 “which made it real and personal.
00:01:04 “It made me feel closer to Jehovah than ever before,
00:01:08 and that feeling will never be forgotten.”
00:01:13 Well, unquestionably, your deep study of God’s Word during Gilead
00:01:17 drew you closer to Jehovah.
00:01:20 But here’s the question,
00:01:23 How close can you be?
00:01:25 How close can your relationship with Jehovah get?
00:01:29 You saw it leap forward in five months of deep Bible study, but is there a limit?
00:01:34 Is there more? Will you ever get done?
00:01:37 Consider two points that answer that question.
00:01:41 The first one is found in the book of James chapter 4,
00:01:46 and let’s read together the first part of verse 8.
00:01:51 And let’s read it with that question in mind:
00:01:53 Is there any limit to how close our relationship with Jehovah could be?
00:01:59 James 4:8 says:
00:02:02 “Draw close to God,
00:02:04 and he will draw close to you.”
00:02:09 So is there any limit indicated here?
00:02:13 Well, it is true that in English this phrase to “draw close to” someone
00:02:17 could be applied in a physical sense
00:02:19 —actually standing next to someone.
00:02:21 And in that case, there is a limit.
00:02:23 You can only stand so close to someone.
00:02:26 But that’s not really the sense of James 4:8, is it?
00:02:29 Rather, it’s in this sense: When we talk about our close friends,
00:02:34 we’re not talking about those that are nearest in proximity.
00:02:38 We’re talking about the depth of our relationship,
00:02:40 the closeness of our friendship.
00:02:43 And so then to “draw close to God” then means
00:02:46 to strengthen our relationship, strengthen our friendship, with him.
00:02:51 And then looking at the verse, does it appear that there’s any limit
00:02:54 to how close that relationship can get?
00:02:57 The implication is that as long as we keep drawing close to Jehovah,
00:03:01 then he’ll keep drawing close to us.
00:03:05 And that takes us to our second point,
00:03:08 and that is the real life example of God’s Son,
00:03:13 because Jesus drew close to Jehovah.
00:03:15 Clearly, he was taught by Jehovah.
00:03:17 Remember Isaiah 50:4,
00:03:19 regarding Jesus’ prehuman existence, where he said:
00:03:22 “He awakens me morning by morning;
00:03:25 he awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones.”
00:03:30 Does that sound a bit like your Gilead training?
00:03:33 ‘Morning by morning Jehovah was awakening your ear.’
00:03:37 Yet, Jesus wasn’t instructed by Jehovah for five months;
00:03:41 he was instructed for billions of years.
00:03:45 And during all that time,
00:03:48 his relationship with his Father continued to grow and deepen.
00:03:54 So, then, we put it all together.
00:03:56 You saw your relationship with Jehovah grow significantly
00:04:00 in five months of deep Bible study.
00:04:03 James 4:8 encourages us to just keep drawing close to Jehovah.
00:04:08 And Jesus did so for billions of years,
00:04:10 and look at how close his relationship with Jehovah is.
00:04:15 So, then, what’s the answer?
00:04:17 How close can you be to Jehovah?
00:04:22 The potential for your relationship with Jehovah to deepen
00:04:26 is endless.
00:04:30 Well, that’s just wonderful to contemplate, isn’t it?
00:04:33 But let’s make some application
00:04:35 because this really becomes a very important overall lesson
00:04:38 that you take with you from your Gilead experience:
00:04:41 That is how your deep Bible study
00:04:44 affected your relationship with Jehovah.
00:04:47 And one of the reasons why this is such an important lesson
00:04:50 is because your success in your assignment
00:04:53 is directly connected to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah.
00:05:00 Your success in your assignment
00:05:02 is directly connected to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah.
00:05:06 Now, why can we say that?
00:05:09 It’s because of what takes place
00:05:11 when we draw close to Jehovah through a study of his Word.
00:05:15 Turn with me, please, to the book of Psalms,
00:05:19 and we’ll read the 25th Psalm
00:05:23 in verse 4
00:05:28 —Psalm 25:4.
00:05:31 It says:
00:05:32 “Make me know your ways, O Jehovah;
00:05:37 teach me your paths.”
00:05:40 This is what’s happening when we study God’s Word, isn’t it?
00:05:42 We are coming to know Jehovah God’s ways.
00:05:46 The Watchtower  once said it this way.
00:05:48 It said: “As we get a deeper and deeper understanding of God’s Word,
00:05:52 we become imbued with God’s way of thinking.”
00:05:58 “We become imbued with God’s way of thinking.”
00:06:01 The dictionary said that the word
00:06:03 “imbue implies the introduction of a quality
00:06:07 that fills and permeates the whole being,”
00:06:12 so like dyeing a garment or leavening bread.
00:06:16 But here we’re talking about being imbued with God’s thinking,
00:06:20 that maybe God’s thinking would fill and permeate our whole being.
00:06:25 Is that possible?
00:06:28 Think back to the example of Jesus.
00:06:31 As we discussed, Jesus drew close to Jehovah.
00:06:34 He was taught by Jehovah for billions of years.
00:06:37 And what was happening during that whole time?
00:06:40 He was being imbued with Jehovah God’s thinking.
00:06:45 And it so permeated him that when he was on earth,
00:06:48 he could say at John 14:9:
00:06:50 “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.”
00:06:55 So in other words, everything that Jesus said,
00:06:58 everything that he did while on earth in every situation,
00:07:02 well, we could imagine Jehovah doing and saying those very things.
00:07:09 And that is why the success of your assignment
00:07:13 is directly connected to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah.
00:07:18 The more you draw close to Jehovah through a study of his Word,
00:07:22 then the more you are imbued with his thinking
00:07:25 and the more then you will do, or act,
00:07:28 and say things as Jehovah would.
00:07:32 And so how does this play out?
00:07:34 Well, in your assignment,
00:07:36 if you have the privilege to contribute to significant decisions
00:07:41 that will affect others in your department
00:07:44 or at the branch or in the field even,
00:07:48 my, you want to be guided by Jehovah’s thinking, don’t you?
00:07:51 You want to do things as he would do them.
00:07:54 Well, the closer you are to Jehovah, the deeper that relationship is,
00:07:59 the more your decisions will mirror his.
00:08:05 But, of course, we know strengthening and stabilizing others
00:08:08 isn’t always done in big, grand gestures like that
00:08:10 —big decisions, new organizational arrangements.
00:08:13 Quite often it’s the day-to-day interactions with others
00:08:17 that really encourage them.
00:08:19 And isn’t it true that we learn so much
00:08:21 from those intimate conversations that Jesus had with others,
00:08:25 or seemingly incidental interactions that he had with others,
00:08:30 that the Bible records?
00:08:32 Well, you will strengthen others in similar ways.
00:08:36 For example,
00:08:38 when you are guided by Jehovah’s thinking in personal matters,
00:08:42 such as in your choice of dress and grooming,
00:08:46 well, others will certainly notice that
00:08:48 and that will strengthen their resolve
00:08:50 to make good decisions in these personal areas.
00:08:54 When you are guided by Jehovah’s thinking in the use of your time,
00:08:58 as busy as you will be
00:09:00 —when the friends see you in the ministry,
00:09:02 at the meetings, working hard in your assignment—
00:09:05 they will take notice of that
00:09:07 and that will strengthen their resolve to make good priorities in their life.
00:09:12 Every time you steer a negative conversation to the positive,
00:09:16 every time you show a willingness to do humble tasks,
00:09:19 every time you take the time to get the other side of the story
00:09:23 before rendering judgment
00:09:25 —yes, in all these areas of your daily life,
00:09:28 you give evidence that you have drawn close to Jehovah,
00:09:31 you have been imbued with his thinking,
00:09:34 and you are acting as Jehovah would.
00:09:38 And in that case,
00:09:39 you absolutely will strengthen and stabilize your brothers!
00:09:47 Well, we love you
00:09:49 for your relationship with Jehovah.
00:09:52 And we encourage you to take this lesson of Gilead with you
00:09:56 —the effect that your deep Bible study had on your relationship with Jehovah—
00:10:01 and keep drawing close to him.
00:10:03 The potential is endless,
00:10:06 and this is what will ensure your success.
00:10:10 Well, may the rich blessing of Jehovah, your Friend, be with you
00:10:15 as you use your Gilead training in the assignments he has given you.
