00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:05.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you students answer this question:

00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:08.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you feel closer to Jehovah now

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:12.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
than you did
before your Gilead training began?

00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:17.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is a resounding yes, isn’t it?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you can relate to these comments

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
of graduates of past classes of Gilead.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother said: “Absolutely, yes!

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:30.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I believe I now experience more fully

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what it means to walk with God

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:36.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and know and rely upon him
as a close Friend,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
not merely someone
I turn and look up to in prayer.”

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:46.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister said:
“Gilead definitely drew me closer to Jehovah.

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:49.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The way we studied the Scriptures
with intensity

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:54.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
truly made me feel like the Bible
was a letter Jehovah wrote to me.”

00:00:56.272 --> 00:01:01.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another brother said:
“Jehovah communicated with such clarity,

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:03.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which made it real and personal.

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:08.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It made me feel closer to Jehovah
than ever before,

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that feeling will never be forgotten.”

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:17.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, unquestionably,
your deep study of God’s Word during Gilead

00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:19.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
drew you closer to Jehovah.

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the question,

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:25.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
How close can you be?

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
How close
can your relationship with Jehovah get?

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:34.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw it leap forward in five months
of deep Bible study, but is there a limit?

00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:36.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there more?
Will you ever get done?

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:41.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider two points
that answer that question.

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:44.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is found
in the book of James chapter 4,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read together
the first part of verse 8.

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:53.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s read it with that question in mind:

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there any limit to how close
our relationship with Jehovah could be?

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:02.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 4:8 says:

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Draw close to God,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will draw close to you.”

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:13.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
So is there any limit indicated here?

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it is true that in English
this phrase to “draw close to” someone

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:19.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
could be applied in a physical sense

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:21.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
—actually standing next to someone.

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that case, there is a limit.

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:26.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can only stand so close to someone.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s not really the sense of James 4:8,
is it?

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:34.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, it’s in this sense:
When we talk about our close friends,

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not talking about those
that are nearest in proximity.

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:40.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re talking
about the depth of our relationship,

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:43.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
the closeness of our friendship.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so then to “draw close to God” then means

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen our relationship,
strengthen our friendship, with him.

00:02:51.054 --> 00:02:54.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then looking at the verse,
does it appear that there’s any limit

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:57.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
to how close that relationship can get?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
The implication is that as long
as we keep drawing close to Jehovah,

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:04.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
then he’ll keep drawing close to us.

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that takes us to our second point,

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:13.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is the real life example
of God’s Son,

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus drew close to Jehovah.

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, he was taught by Jehovah.

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:19.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Isaiah 50:4,

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding Jesus’ prehuman existence,
where he said:

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He awakens me morning by morning;

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:30.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
he awakens my ear
to listen like the taught ones.”

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that sound a bit
like your Gilead training?

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:37.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Morning by morning
Jehovah was awakening your ear.’

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:41.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, Jesus wasn’t instructed by Jehovah
for five months;

00:03:41.437 --> 00:03:45.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was instructed for billions of years.

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:48.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during all that time,

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:53.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
his relationship with his Father
continued to grow and deepen.

00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:56.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, we put it all together.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw your relationship with Jehovah
grow significantly

00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:03.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
in five months of deep Bible study.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 4:8 encourages us
to just keep drawing close to Jehovah.

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:10.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus did so for billions of years,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look at how close
his relationship with Jehovah is.

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:17.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what’s the answer?

00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:20.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
How close can you be to Jehovah?

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:26.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
The potential for your relationship
with Jehovah to deepen

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:28.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
is endless.

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s just wonderful to contemplate,
isn’t it?

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s make some application

00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:38.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
because this really becomes
a very important overall lesson

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:41.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you take with you
from your Gilead experience:

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:44.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how your deep Bible study

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
affected your relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one of the reasons
why this is such an important lesson

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:53.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because your success in your assignment

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
is directly connected to the depth
of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:02.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your success in your assignment

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:06.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
is directly connected to the depth
of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why can we say that?

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:11.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because of what takes place

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we draw close to Jehovah
through a study of his Word.

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:19.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to the book of Psalms,

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:22.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read the 25th Psalm

00:05:23.973 --> 00:05:26.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 4

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 25:4.

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:32.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:37.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Make me know your ways, O Jehovah;

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:40.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
teach me your paths.”

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:42.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what’s happening
when we study God’s Word, isn’t it?

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:46.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are coming to know Jehovah God’s ways.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once said it this way.

00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:52.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said: “As we get a deeper
and deeper understanding of God’s Word,

00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
we become imbued
with God’s way of thinking.”

00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We become imbued
with God’s way of thinking.”

00:06:01.844 --> 00:06:03.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
The dictionary said that the word

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:07.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“imbue implies the introduction of a quality

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:12.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fills and permeates the whole being,”

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:16.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
so like dyeing a garment or leavening bread.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:20.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here we’re talking
about being imbued with God’s thinking,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
that maybe God’s thinking
would fill and permeate our whole being.

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:27.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that possible?

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:31.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to the example of Jesus.

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:34.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we discussed,
Jesus drew close to Jehovah.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was taught by Jehovah
for billions of years.

00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:40.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what was happening
during that whole time?

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:45.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was being imbued
with Jehovah God’s thinking.

00:06:45.254 --> 00:06:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it so permeated him
that when he was on earth,

00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:50.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could say at John 14:9:

00:06:50.726 --> 00:06:55.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whoever has seen me
has seen the Father also.”

00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:58.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in other words,
everything that Jesus said,

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:02.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything that he did while on earth
in every situation,

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:07.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, we could imagine Jehovah
doing and saying those very things.

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:13.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is why
the success of your assignment

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:18.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
is directly connected to the depth
of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:22.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more you draw close to Jehovah
through a study of his Word,

00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:25.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the more you are imbued
with his thinking

00:07:25.394 --> 00:07:28.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the more then you will do, or act,

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:31.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say things as Jehovah would.

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:34.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so how does this play out?

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:36.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in your assignment,

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:41.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you have the privilege
to contribute to significant decisions

00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:44.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will affect others in your department

00:07:44.514 --> 00:07:48.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
or at the branch or in the field even,

00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:51.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
my, you want to be guided
by Jehovah’s thinking, don’t you?

00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:54.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to do things as he would do them.

00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:59.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the closer you are to Jehovah,
the deeper that relationship is,

00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:02.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more your decisions will mirror his.

00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:08.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, we know
strengthening and stabilizing others

00:08:08.337 --> 00:08:10.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
isn’t always done
in big, grand gestures like that

00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:13.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
—big decisions,
new organizational arrangements.

00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:17.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Quite often it’s the day-to-day interactions
with others

00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:19.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really encourage them.

00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:21.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it true that we learn so much

00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:25.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
from those intimate conversations
that Jesus had with others,

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:30.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
or seemingly incidental interactions
that he had with others,

00:08:30.493 --> 00:08:32.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible records?

00:08:32.695 --> 00:08:36.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you will strengthen others
in similar ways.

00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:38.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:42.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you are guided
by Jehovah’s thinking in personal matters,

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as in your choice of dress and grooming,

00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:48.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, others will certainly notice that

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:50.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will strengthen their resolve

00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:54.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make good decisions
in these personal areas.

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:58.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you are guided by Jehovah’s thinking
in the use of your time,

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
as busy as you will be

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when the friends see you in the ministry,

00:09:02.992 --> 00:09:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the meetings,
working hard in your assignment—

00:09:05.328 --> 00:09:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will take notice of that

00:09:07.363 --> 00:09:11.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will strengthen their resolve
to make good priorities in their life.

00:09:12.602 --> 00:09:16.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time you steer
a negative conversation to the positive,

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:19.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
every time you show
a willingness to do humble tasks,

00:09:19.842 --> 00:09:23.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
every time you take the time
to get the other side of the story

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
before rendering judgment

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:28.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, in all these areas of your daily life,

00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:31.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
you give evidence
that you have drawn close to Jehovah,

00:09:31.687 --> 00:09:34.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have been imbued with his thinking,

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you are acting as Jehovah would.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that case,

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:44.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
you absolutely will strengthen and stabilize
your brothers!

00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:49.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we love you

00:09:49.438 --> 00:09:52.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your relationship with Jehovah.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:56.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we encourage you
to take this lesson of Gilead with you

00:09:56.712 --> 00:10:01.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the effect that your deep Bible study
had on your relationship with Jehovah—

00:10:01.484 --> 00:10:03.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep drawing close to him.

00:10:03.986 --> 00:10:06.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
The potential is endless,

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:09.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is what will ensure your success.

00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, may the rich blessing of Jehovah,
your Friend, be with you

00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:19.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you use your Gilead training
in the assignments he has given you.
