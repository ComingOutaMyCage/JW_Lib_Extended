00:00:01 The year was 608 B.C.E.
00:00:05 The prophet Jeremiah had already served
00:00:07 nearly 40 years faithfully,
00:00:10 and now he “was confined in the Courtyard of the Guard” in Jerusalem.
00:00:15 Jerusalem’s walls were being battered by the Babylonians.
00:00:19 In less than a year,
00:00:21 the entire city would be completely destroyed.
00:00:24 Jeremiah had to weather the storm.
00:00:26 There was no way out. There was no place for him to go.
00:00:29 He was under lockdown.
00:00:32 Well, have you ever felt like Jeremiah
00:00:34 —as if the world was caving in on you?
00:00:38 Maybe it was a serious health scare,
00:00:41 the health of a loved one, the death of a loved one,
00:00:48 or maybe COVID-19 has made you feel boxed in.
00:00:51 Some of our brothers, just like Jeremiah, have faced persecution or imprisonment,
00:00:56 and that might be our lot before the end of this system of things.
00:01:00 Well, what will help you students
00:01:02 —in fact, all of us—
00:01:05 during these critical last days
00:01:06 when we face personal trials, or adversity?
00:01:09 I invite you to open to Jeremiah chapter 32.
00:01:13 Let’s consider a dramatic illustration in the life of Jeremiah.
00:01:17 Now, Jeremiah is under lockdown.
00:01:20 Jeremiah chapter 32,
00:01:22 let’s read verses 6-8:
00:01:26 “Jeremiah said: ‘The word of Jehovah has come to me, saying,
00:01:31 “‘“Here Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say:
00:01:35 “‘“‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth,
00:01:37 because you have the first right to repurchase it.’”’”
00:01:41 Verse 8 says: “Hanamel the son of my uncle came to me,
00:01:43 “just as Jehovah had said, into the Courtyard of the Guard,
00:01:47 “and he said to me: ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth,
00:01:50 “‘in the land of Benjamin, for you have the right to take possession of it
00:01:53 “‘and to repurchase it.
00:01:55 “Buy it for yourself.’
00:01:57 At that I knew that this was by the word of Jehovah.”
00:02:02 What was Jehovah’s instruction to Jeremiah?
00:02:05 Buy a field.
00:02:06 Buy a field?
00:02:08 Right now, with the Babylonians beating on the door?
00:02:11 Jeremiah might have thought,
00:02:13 ‘I need an escape plan, not a field
00:02:17 —of all places, Anathoth?’
00:02:19 Where was Anathoth?
00:02:21 Well, Jeremiah knew exactly where it was
00:02:23 —just a few miles north-northeast of Jerusalem.
00:02:26 He was born there into a priestly family.
00:02:29 Did he have pleasant memories of his past in Anathoth as a youth?
00:02:34 Very likely.
00:02:35 But now that was a distant memory.
00:02:39 More recently, men of Anathoth, possibly some of Jeremiah’s own relatives,
00:02:43 threatened to kill him because of his prophesying.
00:02:46 Well, did Jeremiah obey
00:02:49 in spite of any personal feelings he might have had?
00:02:52 Jeremiah always obeyed,
00:02:55 even previously when Jehovah told him not to take a wife or to have children.
00:03:00 Well, what did he do in this situation?
00:03:02 Verses 9 and 10:
00:03:04 “So I bought the field in Anathoth from Hanamel the son of my uncle.
00:03:09 “I weighed out the money to him, seven shekels and ten silver pieces.
00:03:13 “Then I recorded it in a deed, affixed the seal,
00:03:16 called in witnesses, and weighed the money in the scales.”
00:03:20 Jeremiah could have worked in the Legal Department.
00:03:25 Well, he carried out the legal transaction,
00:03:28 the legal requirements of the transaction.
00:03:30 He recorded the transaction in two deeds
00:03:32 —one sealed, one unsealed—
00:03:35 complete transparency in this situation.
00:03:39 Why did Jehovah ask Jeremiah to buy a field in Anathoth?
00:03:44 Jeremiah already had complete faith that, yes, Jehovah’s word would be restored
00:03:49 —when 70 years had transpired, the Jews would return to their homeland.
00:03:53 But now Jehovah reinforced Jeremiah’s faith
00:03:56 by giving him something specific to think about.
00:03:59 Jeremiah could imagine the time
00:04:01 when buying and selling would again occur in Israel.
00:04:05 Well, was Jeremiah’s faith well-placed in Jehovah’s promise?
00:04:11 Absolutely.
00:04:13 Ezra later documented that 128 men of Anathoth
00:04:17 were among the first group of those returning from Babylonian exile.
00:04:22 Jehovah’s word always comes true.
00:04:27 Well, how might we —how might you—
00:04:31 “buy a field in Anathoth”?
00:04:33 Well, we’re not expecting you to go out and purchase
00:04:37 a piece of property in a place called Anathoth.
00:04:39 No.
00:04:40 We find a clue, though, in Hebrews chapter 11
00:04:44 —Hebrews 11:1:
00:04:49 “Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for,
00:04:53 the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.”
00:04:59 The Simple English Bible  renders it this way:
00:05:02 “Faith is the title-deed
00:05:06 to the things we hope for.”
00:05:08 Now, most of us in special full-time service, we don’t own property.
00:05:12 But we may have the title to a car.
00:05:15 What does that mean?
00:05:16 That means that car, that vehicle, belongs to us personally.
00:05:21 Our faith is the “title-deed” of good things to come,
00:05:25 a guarantee of future realities.
00:05:27 Jeremiah had a “title-deed.”
00:05:29 We have a “title-deed” of faith.
00:05:32 So how do we “buy a field in Anathoth”?
00:05:36 It’s not a type-antitype situation; it’s just an illustration.
00:05:40 In the context of our discussion,
00:05:42 it means we exercise faith in Jehovah’s promises.
00:05:47 When facing a trial,
00:05:49 we can search Jehovah’s Word for promises regarding the future,
00:05:54 and that gives us strength to keep on enduring.
00:05:56 For example, if we’re facing a serious illness,
00:06:00 God’s Word promises: “No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”
00:06:06 If we’re grieving the death of a loved one,
00:06:09 the Bible assures us there is going to be a resurrection.
00:06:14 The trial doesn’t disappear yet,
00:06:16 but exercising faith in Jehovah’s promises
00:06:19 helps us to endure.
00:06:22 Now, there’s something else that we can learn
00:06:24 from that dramatic illustration in the life of Jeremiah.
00:06:27 Back in Jeremiah 32, notice, please, verses 13 through 15.
00:06:33 Jeremiah was inspired to write, he said:
00:06:36 “I now commanded Baruch in their presence, saying:
00:06:39 “‘This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says,
00:06:44 “‘“Take these deeds, this deed of purchase,
00:06:47 “‘“the sealed one and the other deed left unsealed,
00:06:49 “‘“and put them into an earthenware vessel,
00:06:51 “‘so that they may be kept for a long time.”
00:06:54 “‘For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says,
00:06:59 “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”’”
00:07:05 Jeremiah involved Baruch in the legal proceedings
00:07:08 when he bought the field in Anathoth.
00:07:11 Jeremiah’s faith influenced Baruch for the good.
00:07:16 We can almost hear the confidence and conviction in his voice:
00:07:20 “This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel says.”
00:07:24 Jeremiah used that expression,
00:07:26 “Jehovah of armies,” more than any other Bible writer.
00:07:28 It was like Jeremiah said:
00:07:30 ‘Our God will certainly overturn the Babylonians.
00:07:33 ‘These promises are real; you can take them to the bank!
00:07:36 They’re not counterfeit; they’re completely true!’
00:07:40 What’s the lesson for us?
00:07:43 Our faith can strengthen fellow believers.
00:07:47 A sister named Joyce, while she herself was fighting cancer,
00:07:51 made what she called shot-in-the-arm cards.
00:07:56 They were collections of Bible verses,
00:07:59 pictures from our publications,
00:08:01 quotes from theocratic songs or Watchtower  articles,
00:08:04 and she would give them to those in need of encouragement.
00:08:07 One of her favorites was Psalm 112:7, 8.
00:08:11 And there it says: “He will not fear bad news.
00:08:15 “His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.
00:08:18 “His heart is unshakable; he is not afraid;
00:08:20 in the end he will look in triumph on his adversaries.”
00:08:25 Sister Joyce had a lot of bad news in her life,
00:08:30 but her faith in Jehovah’s promises was powerful.
00:08:34 Sadly, Joyce lost her fight with cancer a few years back,
00:08:38 but she “bought a field in Anathoth,”
00:08:41 and she will witness the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises.
00:08:47 Even now, she’s given us a shot in the arm
00:08:49 —encouragement from Jehovah’s Word—
00:08:51 and strengthened us with her faith.
00:08:53 And so, dear Gilead students, what have we learned?
00:08:57 Faith is like a “title-deed of things hoped for.”
00:09:01 Faith in Jehovah’s Word helps us to endure trials and adversity.
00:09:05 Our faith can have a powerful effect on those around us.
00:09:09 So when faced with persecution, “buy a field in Anathoth.”
00:09:13 When faced with a grievous health problem, “buy a field in Anathoth.”
00:09:18 When grieving the loss of a loved one, “buy a field in Anathoth.”
00:09:21 And some day soon, your faith will be rewarded.
00:09:24 You’ll walk in that field when Jehovah’s word comes true.
