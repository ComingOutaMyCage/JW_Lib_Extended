00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:05.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
The year was 608 B.C.E.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophet Jeremiah
had already served

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:10.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
nearly 40 years faithfully,

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:15.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now he “was confined
in the Courtyard of the Guard” in Jerusalem.

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem’s walls
were being battered by the Babylonians.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
In less than a year,

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire city
would be completely destroyed.

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:26.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah had to weather the storm.

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:29.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no way out.
There was no place for him to go.

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:30.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was under lockdown.

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:34.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, have you ever felt like Jeremiah

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:37.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
—as if the world was caving in on you?

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:41.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it was a serious health scare,

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:45.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
the health of a loved one,
the death of a loved one,

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe COVID-19
has made you feel boxed in.

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:56.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our brothers, just like Jeremiah,
have faced persecution or imprisonment,

00:00:56.673 --> 00:01:00.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that might be our lot
before the end of this system of things.

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:02.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what will help you students

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in fact, all of us—

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
during these critical last days

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:09.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we face personal trials, or adversity?

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:13.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to open to Jeremiah chapter 32.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:17.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a dramatic illustration
in the life of Jeremiah.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:20.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jeremiah is under lockdown.

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:22.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah chapter 32,

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s read verses 6-8:

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:31.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jeremiah said: ‘The word of Jehovah
has come to me, saying,

00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:35.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Here Hanamel the son of Shallum
your uncle will come to you and say:

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:37.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth,

00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:41.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you have the first right
to repurchase it.’”’”

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says:
“Hanamel the son of my uncle came to me,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as Jehovah had said,
into the Courtyard of the Guard,

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he said to me:
‘Please buy my field in Anathoth,

00:01:50.794 --> 00:01:53.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in the land of Benjamin, for you
have the right to take possession of it

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and to repurchase it.

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:57.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Buy it for yourself.’

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that I knew that this was
by the word of Jehovah.”

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Jehovah’s instruction to Jeremiah?

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:06.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Buy a field.

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:08.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Buy a field?

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right now, with the Babylonians
beating on the door?

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:13.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah might have thought,

00:02:13.683 --> 00:02:17.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I need an escape plan, not a field

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
—of all places, Anathoth?’

00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where was Anathoth?

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jeremiah knew exactly where it was

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:26.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just a few miles
north-northeast of Jerusalem.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was born there into a priestly family.

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:34.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he have pleasant memories of his past
in Anathoth as a youth?

00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:35.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very likely.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now that was a distant memory.

00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:43.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
More recently, men of Anathoth,
possibly some of Jeremiah’s own relatives,

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:46.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
threatened to kill him
because of his prophesying.

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, did Jeremiah obey

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:52.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spite of any personal feelings
he might have had?

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah always obeyed,

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
even previously when Jehovah told him
not to take a wife or to have children.

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did he do in this situation?

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 9 and 10:

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So I bought the field in Anathoth
from Hanamel the son of my uncle.

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I weighed out the money to him,
seven shekels and ten silver pieces.

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:16.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then I recorded it in a deed,
affixed the seal,

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:19.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
called in witnesses,
and weighed the money in the scales.”

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah could have worked
in the Legal Department.

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:28.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he carried out the legal transaction,

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
the legal requirements of the transaction.

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:32.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
He recorded the transaction in two deeds

00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:35.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one sealed, one unsealed—

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:39.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
complete transparency in this situation.

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:42.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did Jehovah ask Jeremiah
to buy a field in Anathoth?

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:49.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah already had complete faith that,
yes, Jehovah’s word would be restored

00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:53.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when 70 years had transpired,
the Jews would return to their homeland.

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:56.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now Jehovah reinforced Jeremiah’s faith

00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:59.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving him something specific
to think about.

00:03:59.622 --> 00:04:01.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah could imagine the time

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:04.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
when buying and selling
would again occur in Israel.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:10.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, was Jeremiah’s faith
well-placed in Jehovah’s promise?

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:04:13.102 --> 00:04:17.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra later documented
that 128 men of Anathoth

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:21.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
were among the first group
of those returning from Babylonian exile.

00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:26.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s word always comes true.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:31.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how might we
—how might you—

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“buy a field in Anathoth”?

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:37.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re not expecting you
to go out and purchase

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:39.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
a piece of property
in a place called Anathoth.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:40.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find a clue, though, in Hebrews chapter 11

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:46.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Hebrews 11:1:

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:53.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for,

00:04:53.977 --> 00:04:57.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
the evident demonstration
of realities that are not seen.”

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:02.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Simple English Bible </i>
renders it this way:

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:06.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faith is the title-deed

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the things we hope for.”

00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:12.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, most of us in special full-time service,
we don’t own property.

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:15.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we may have the title to a car.

00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:16.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that car, that vehicle,
belongs to us personally.

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:25.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith is the “title-deed”
of good things to come,

00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
a guarantee of future realities.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah had a “title-deed.”

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:32.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a “title-deed” of faith.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we “buy a field in Anathoth”?

00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:40.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a type-antitype situation;
it’s just an illustration.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the context of our discussion,

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:46.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
it means we exercise faith
in Jehovah’s promises.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
When facing a trial,

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:54.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can search Jehovah’s Word
for promises regarding the future,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that gives us strength
to keep on enduring.

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
if we’re facing a serious illness,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word promises:
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:08.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re grieving the death of a loved one,

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible assures us
there is going to be a resurrection.

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
The trial doesn’t disappear yet,

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
but exercising faith in Jehovah’s promises

00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:21.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to endure.

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:24.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s something else that we can learn

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:27.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
from that dramatic illustration
in the life of Jeremiah.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in Jeremiah 32, notice,
please, verses 13 through 15.

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:36.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah was inspired to write, he said:

00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:39.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I now commanded Baruch
in their presence, saying:

00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:44.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This is what Jehovah of armies,
the God of Israel, says,

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Take these deeds, this deed of purchase,

00:06:47.023 --> 00:06:49.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“the sealed one
and the other deed left unsealed,

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:51.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“and put them into an earthenware vessel,

00:06:51.894 --> 00:06:54.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that they may be kept for a long time.”

00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:59.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For this is what Jehovah of armies,
the God of Israel, says,

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:03.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Houses and fields and vineyards
will again be bought in this land.”’”

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:08.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah involved Baruch
in the legal proceedings

00:07:08.978 --> 00:07:11.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he bought the field in Anathoth.

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:16.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah’s faith
influenced Baruch for the good.

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:20.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can almost hear
the confidence and conviction in his voice:

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:24.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies,
the God of Israel says.”

00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:26.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah used that expression,

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:28.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah of armies,”
more than any other Bible writer.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like Jeremiah said:

00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:33.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Our God will certainly overturn
the Babylonians.

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:36.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘These promises are real;
you can take them to the bank!

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:38.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not counterfeit;
they’re completely true!’

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:46.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith can strengthen fellow believers.

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:51.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister named Joyce,
while she herself was fighting cancer,

00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:55.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
made what she called shot-in-the-arm cards.

00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were collections of Bible verses,

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:01.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
pictures from our publications,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
quotes from theocratic songs
or <i>Watchtower </i> articles,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she would give them
to those in need of encouragement.

One of her favorites was Psalm 112:7, 8.

00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there it says:
“He will not fear bad news.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.

00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:20.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His heart is unshakable; he is not afraid;

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the end he will look in triumph
on his adversaries.”

Sister Joyce had
a lot of bad news in her life,

00:08:30.193 --> 00:08:33.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
but her faith in Jehovah’s promises
was powerful.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:38.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, Joyce lost her fight with cancer
a few years back,

00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:40.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she “bought a field in Anathoth,”

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she will witness
the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even now, she’s given us a shot in the arm

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
—encouragement from Jehovah’s Word—

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthened us with her faith.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, dear Gilead students,
what have we learned?

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith is like
a “title-deed of things hoped for.”

00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:05.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith in Jehovah’s Word
helps us to endure trials and adversity.

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:09.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith can have
a powerful effect on those around us.

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:12.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when faced with persecution,
“buy a field in Anathoth.”

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:18.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
When faced with a grievous health problem,
“buy a field in Anathoth.”

00:09:18.074 --> 00:09:21.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
When grieving the loss of a loved one,
“buy a field in Anathoth.”

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:23.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some day soon,
your faith will be rewarded.

00:09:24.914 --> 00:09:29.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll walk in that field
when Jehovah’s word comes true.
