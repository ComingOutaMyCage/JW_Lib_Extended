00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:03.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in any graduation program,

00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:08.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
we get to the point when the principal talk,
or the main talk, is given.

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:10.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this time, we have a special privilege

00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:13.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
of having a longtime member
of the Governing Body,

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Samuel Herd, speak to us.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the subject that he has
is a very interesting subject:

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Any Day Now.”

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Herd, please.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will be going home
or to a new assignment.

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:32.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want you to know that you will be missed.

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:37.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was good for the Bethel family
to have you with us.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a blessing from Jehovah.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a pregnant woman,
your bellies are swelled to the limit.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the signs tell you

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a baby is about to be born.

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:53.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re rushed to see the doctor.

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:55.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
He examines you.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:57.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you ask, “When?”

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says, “Any day now.”

00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:03.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your minds and hearts are about to burst

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:07.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
with spiritual things to deliver to others.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, this is a day for delivering.

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:15.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your spirituality is contagious.

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you walk into a room,
you bring sunshine with you.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what Jesus said
to some of his followers

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 5:14-16:

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are the light of the world.

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A city cannot be hid

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when located on a mountain.

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:36.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“People light a lamp and set it,

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not under a basket,

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:40.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but on the lampstand,

00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:44.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it shines on all those in the house.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Likewise, let your light shine before men,

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they may see your fine works

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:54.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and give glory to your Father

00:01:54.063 --> 00:01:56.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is in the heavens.”

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:01.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all,
your spiritual brothers and sisters

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in the house with you.

00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:09.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shine on them, but don’t limit it to them.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want others to see the light.

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:15.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the past five months,

00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have been studying
the personality of Jehovah

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking to him by means of prayer.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:31.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans cannot see
the literal Person, Jehovah.

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Jehovah God to set down

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
a description of himself in spirit terms

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:41.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be like trying to explain colors

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:43.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a person born blind.

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:49.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have been asking for him
to help you in your studies,

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has helped you.

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:57.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without his help,
you would not be graduating.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re ready as never before

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:03.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let your light shine

00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:07.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your fleshly family members,

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
your Bible students,

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:12.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t make it so bright and intense

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:22.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you put out the eyes
of those around you.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:25.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn the wick down in your lamp.

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:30.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no need to say every time:

00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:33.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were taught this in Gilead.”

00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were taught this
in one of our Gilead classes.”

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:41.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A member of the Governing Body
called this to our attention

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:44.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a lecture he gave.”

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
You knew some things
before you came to Gilead.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
You knew that God’s name is Jehovah

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:55.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that it is unique,

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
meaning the only one of its kind.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Sam,

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuel, or Sammy.

00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:08.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not unique.

00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:11.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many others with the same name.

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:14.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was named after my father’s brother

00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:16.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Uncle Sam.

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:19.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you get that, Uncle Sam?

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did not name myself.

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:26.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
A baby doesn’t say, after eight months
in his mother’s womb,

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:30.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mommy, when I get out,
call me Sammy.”

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:36.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
God Almighty chose his name, Jehovah.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
He named himself.

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:43.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is different; that is unique.

00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:49.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
You Gilead students,
soon to be a Gilead graduates,

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:53.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
know Jehovah but not completely,

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
not the whole Person, just the fringe.

00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:02.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Compare what you see to an ornamental edging

00:05:02.452 --> 00:05:06.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
of hanging threads of a garment.

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t see the whole garment.

00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:13.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 11:33-36 says:

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O the depth

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:18.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge!

00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:21.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How unsearchable his judgments are

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:26.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and beyond tracing out his ways are!

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:30.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For ‘who has come to know Jehovah’s mind,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or who has become his adviser?’

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or, ‘who has first given to him,

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:42.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that it must be repaid to him?’

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:46.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because from him and by him and for him

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are all things.

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:51.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To him be the glory forever.

00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:52.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amen.”

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:56.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job 36:26

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us: “Yes, God

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:02.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is greater than we can know;

00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:04.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the number of his years

00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:06.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
is beyond comprehension.”

00:06:08.418 --> 00:06:12.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how much knowledge
we have accumulated in our brain,

00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:17.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
it amounts to a grain of sand on a seashore

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:20.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we live forever.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Forever”?

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:25.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is an interesting word.

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is defined as “never-ending,

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:31.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“incessantly,

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:33.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
ceaseless.”

00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:39.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s enough to blow
an imperfect man’s mind away

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not Jehovah’s mind.

00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:44.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he promises obedient humans

00:06:44.954 --> 00:06:49.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
everlasting, never-ending, life.

00:06:51.961 --> 00:06:55.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to read a scripture to you
without revealing

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:57.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it is found in the Bible.

00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:02.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is one of the first
that captured my attention

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:04.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
back in 1956.

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:06.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was before any of you were born.

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that I heard a loud voice

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:14.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the throne say: ‘Look!

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:18.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The tent of God is with mankind,

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and he will reside with them,

00:07:21.124 --> 00:07:24.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and they will be his people.

00:07:24.393 --> 00:07:27.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And God himself with be with them.

00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:31.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And he will wipe out every tear
from their eyes,

00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:35.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and death will be no more,

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:38.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘neither will mourning nor outcry

00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:41.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘nor pain be anymore.

00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:46.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
The former things have passed away.’”

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:48.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where is it in the Bible?

00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:51.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 21:3, 4.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:55.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew you would know that one.

00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are limited
to how much knowledge our brains

00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:02.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
can understand and sort out correctly.

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, one day

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:08.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will know much more than we know today.

00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:12.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we will not know it all.

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:14.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s good.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will never be a know-it-all.

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:24.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time to let your light shine.

00:08:24.554 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our work at the present

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:30.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to inform people
that the Kingdom of God,

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:32.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
a heavenly government,

00:08:32.228 --> 00:08:34.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the only remedy

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:37.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the woes of mankind, which are causing

00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:40.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
so much suffering and death.

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:45.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inform people of the Kingdom,

00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:48.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
but don’t blind them with your bright light

00:08:48.978 --> 00:08:52.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
of knowledge learned at Gilead.

00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:55.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little light will be enough

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:57.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
for them to see where to go.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:03.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was in the army in Germany years ago,

00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:06.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
I drove a truck with five men inside

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:10.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an M101 howitzer artillery gun

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
attached to the rear of the truck.

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:19.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
We traveled during a pitch-dark night
with no lights used.

00:09:19.008 --> 00:09:21.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could only see the tail light

00:09:21.944 --> 00:09:25.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the vehicle in front.

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:29.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was enough light to follow.

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:31.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind,

00:09:31.887 --> 00:09:35.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
there may not be enough time left

00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:39.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your students
and new brothers and sisters

00:09:39.195 --> 00:09:43.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn all that you know.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:46.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feed them not a heavy meal

00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:49.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
of steak and baked potatoes

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
but an appetizer

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:55.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stimulate the juices in the mouth.

00:09:57.446 --> 00:09:59.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any day now

00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:02.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
nations will cause the peoples

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:06.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are looking to them for guidance to think 

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:10.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have finally established peace.

00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:16.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
The need for peace is already
being talked about by national leaders.

00:10:18.968 --> 00:10:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are not fooled by this sham cry

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
of “Peace and security!”

00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:27.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Thessalonians 5:3 says:

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:31.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then sudden destruction

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:39.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is to be instantly on them,

00:10:39.855 --> 00:10:42.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just like birth pains

00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:45.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on a pregnant woman,

00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:53.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will have
the political powers of this world

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:56.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
turn against Babylon the Great

00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:58.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
(that’s false religion).

00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:03.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
After they see the handwriting
on the wall for her

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:06.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and destroy her

00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:10.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
(“sudden destruction” instantly

00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:12.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it won’t take long),

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
her supporters will cry out,

00:11:15.324 --> 00:11:17.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
weeping and mourning, and say,

00:11:17.993 --> 00:11:21.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Too bad, too bad!”

00:11:21.697 --> 00:11:24.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we will be thinking,

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:27.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m glad; I’m glad!’

00:11:28.838 --> 00:11:31.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 18:20 says:

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be glad over her, O heaven,

00:11:34.744 --> 00:11:36.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“also you holy ones

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and apostles and prophets,

00:11:39.715 --> 00:11:42.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because God has pronounced his judgment

00:11:42.718 --> 00:11:46.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
on her in your behalf!”

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:11:49.392 --> 00:11:53.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready
to “be glad over her” destruction?

00:11:55.431 --> 00:11:57.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think you are.

00:11:57.533 --> 00:12:01.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I can’t make that determination.

00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:05.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will know if we were ready

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah protects us

00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the nations turn their guns on us.

00:12:12.882 --> 00:12:15.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time

00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:18.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to continue strengthening
our faith and trust

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s love for us.

00:12:22.057 --> 00:12:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Study, meditate,

00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:29.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
associate, and preach the Kingdom.

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:35.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young David, when facing Goliath,

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
had five smooth stones in his pouch,

00:12:41.444 --> 00:12:43.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pouch of his shepherd’s bag.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
He only used one,

00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:49.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was prepared in case he needed more.

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:55.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we read the Bible and meditate on it,

00:12:55.491 --> 00:13:00.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
our figurative heart absorbs God’s Word.

00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:03.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like putting symbolic stones

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:06.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our figurative heart,

00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:09.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
this gives us the inner strength we need

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:12.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach the Kingdom message now

00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:16.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to proclaim
the hard-hitting judgment message

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we may deliver in the near future.

00:13:21.617 --> 00:13:25.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day for salvation will be closed

00:13:25.254 --> 00:13:27.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
any day now.

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:32.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Noah had gathered all the creatures

00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:34.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah had designated,

00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:36.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with all necessary food

00:13:36.932 --> 00:13:39.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed for all in the ark,

00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:41.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
they went into the ark.

00:13:42.872 --> 00:13:47.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note, it was Jehovah who closed the door,
not Noah.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:51.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 7:16 says:

00:13:51.213 --> 00:13:53.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they went in, male and female

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:55.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of every sort of flesh,

00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:58.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as God had commanded him.

00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:01.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that Jehovah

00:14:01.223 --> 00:14:04.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
shut the door behind him.”

00:14:04.326 --> 00:14:06.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t take it upon ourselves

00:14:06.495 --> 00:14:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
to close the door to salvation.

00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:10.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah shuts the door,

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:15.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can’t push it open
to let Mom or anyone else in.

00:14:17.006 --> 00:14:20.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
You Gileadites
are professional preachers and teachers.

00:14:20.843 --> 00:14:24.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have received training
that not many of your brothers and sisters

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have the privilege to receive

00:14:27.483 --> 00:14:30.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this side of Armageddon.

00:14:30.686 --> 00:14:34.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, without a doubt, you are wiser now

00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:36.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
than you used to be

00:14:36.425 --> 00:14:39.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not as wise as Jesus was

00:14:39.528 --> 00:14:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he said: “What I teach is not mine,

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:49.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
but belongs to him who sent me.”—John 7:16.

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:53.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
We believe Jehovah sent you to Gilead.

00:14:55.444 --> 00:14:57.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep foremost in mind

00:14:57.479 --> 00:15:01.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what you teach belongs to Jehovah,

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:05.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conduct yourselves
in a manner that displays that.

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let your light shine, not too brightly,

00:15:10.693 --> 00:15:14.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just a flicker,
as needed before nightfall

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
—any day now.

00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry, Brother Herd,

00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:37.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
those weren’t people leaving
because they were upset with your talk.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are the students going backstage.

00:15:40.055 --> 00:15:42.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Herd, we loved the talk.

00:15:42.324 --> 00:15:44.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was classic Herd,

00:15:44.126 --> 00:15:46.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we really enjoyed
the points you brought out.

00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:49.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very comforting for me
because this is the first time

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:52.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve had two Geoffreys
on the same program.

00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:57.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
But speaking on behalf
of the other members of the Governing Body,

00:15:57.139 --> 00:16:01.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know there is only one, unique,
Samuel Herd,

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:04.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love you for it.

00:16:04.113 --> 00:16:07.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we have this part
where we give you some statistics

00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:10.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we get into
the really interesting things.

00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:15.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
The number of students in this class is 24;

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:19.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
the average age, 42.8;

00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:23.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
the average years baptized, 26.5;

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:28.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
the average years in full-time service, 19.4;

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:33.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
the average years
in special full-time service, 14.4;

00:16:33.175 --> 00:16:37.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the number of languages
spoken by the 24 students,

00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:39.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
17.

00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:41.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s very interesting.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another interesting feature
to our program today

00:16:45.054 --> 00:16:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we have for the first time
the opportunity to find out

00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:53.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
how many are tied in
with the live stream

00:16:53.896 --> 00:16:55.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
on JW Stream.

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:57.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can actually give you some idea

00:16:57.866 --> 00:17:00.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how many
were listening live to the program.

00:17:00.736 --> 00:17:03.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank those that are tied in

00:17:03.138 --> 00:17:07.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
for taking the time
to put in the attendance figures.

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first of all, from Canada Bethel,

00:17:09.812 --> 00:17:14.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had 398 in attendance.

00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:17.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the United States Bethel,
including the remote offices,

00:17:17.352 --> 00:17:21.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had 5,463;

00:17:21.724 --> 00:17:25.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the live audience via JW Stream,

00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:30.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
42,558

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:33.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 132 countries.

00:17:42.177 --> 00:17:46.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that makes for a total of 48,419.

00:17:46.381 --> 00:17:48.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Probably most of us on the program

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:50.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
are so glad we didn’t know
so many were listening.

00:17:53.756 --> 00:17:56.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have some greetings from near and far.

00:17:56.258 --> 00:17:59.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll just quickly go through
some of the comments.

00:17:59.194 --> 00:18:04.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Australasia branch sends
their warmest love and Christian greetings.

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:09.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Benin branch refers to Isaiah 26:12,

00:18:09.304 --> 00:18:12.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there they quote Jehovah saying,
“Everything we have— ”

00:18:12.374 --> 00:18:16.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, not Jehovah,
but the Israelites were saying:

00:18:16.044 --> 00:18:19.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Everything we have done
you have accomplished for us.”

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that captures the thought, doesn’t it?

00:18:21.884 --> 00:18:24.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Britain mentions how the students

00:18:24.753 --> 00:18:26.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have beautiful memories

00:18:26.421 --> 00:18:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and new friendships that will continue on,

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:30.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ll treasure them for many years.

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:35.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Central African Republic
expresses their deepest gratitude

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
because for the first time,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
a couple from the Central African Republic

00:18:40.435 --> 00:18:42.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been able to attend Gilead.

00:18:42.738 --> 00:18:47.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Czech-Slovak branch
of 115 Bethelites there

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their love and greetings

00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:51.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
—also the Dominican Republic, France,

00:18:51.613 --> 00:18:56.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haiti, Japan, Kazakhstan
(the list goes on and on),

00:18:56.518 --> 00:19:01.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mozambique, Peru, the Philippines, Senegal,

00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
South Africa, Spain, Turkey,

00:19:05.127 --> 00:19:08.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also our brothers in Ukraine.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me read what they say:

00:19:10.532 --> 00:19:12.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As you put your increased knowledge

00:19:12.701 --> 00:19:14.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and strengthened faith to work,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will certainly prove to be
a source of great comfort

00:19:19.308 --> 00:19:22.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to your fellow believers
in your assignments.

00:19:22.444 --> 00:19:24.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is all important

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in these very last days
of this system of things,

00:19:27.983 --> 00:19:31.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as we have witnessed in our branch territory

00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:34.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the recent months of the ongoing war.

00:19:34.389 --> 00:19:37.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing.”

00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:39.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t we appreciate those greetings?

00:19:47.469 --> 00:19:51.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’ve gotten to the point
where we have the opportunity

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:54.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
to present the diplomas,
and Brother David Schafer,

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee, is here

00:19:57.179 --> 00:19:59.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this high-pressure job.

00:19:59.314 --> 00:20:03.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he has the very interesting assignment

00:20:03.552 --> 00:20:07.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
of naming the families,
the brothers and sisters.

00:20:07.823 --> 00:20:10.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them have
a little bit difficult names to pronounce,

00:20:10.859 --> 00:20:13.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m sure you’ll be good, Dave.

00:20:13.095 --> 00:20:16.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he has to give me
the envelopes to pass on.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’m handing it over to you.

who will return to Warwick.

00:22:51.386 --> 00:22:55.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I have the pleasure now
to introduce you

00:22:55.724 --> 00:23:00.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the graduates
of the 152nd class of Gilead.

00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:14.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at this point, we have a letter
that’s going to be read

00:23:14.876 --> 00:23:18.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Brother Jason Piscopo,
who is returning to Australasia,

00:23:18.947 --> 00:23:22.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s reading this letter
on behalf of this class.

00:23:29.024 --> 00:23:33.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dear brothers of the Governing Body
and the Bethel family:

00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:38.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘With what will I repay Jehovah
for all the good he has done for me?’

00:23:39.568 --> 00:23:44.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How fittingly these words of Psalm 116:12

00:23:44.573 --> 00:23:48.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“describe the sentiments of each one of us

00:23:48.043 --> 00:23:51.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at the end of this wonderful journey!

00:23:51.113 --> 00:23:54.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our hearts
are simply bursting in appreciation

00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:58.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to our loving Grand Instructor, Jehovah.

00:23:58.053 --> 00:24:00.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Prior to coming to Gilead,

00:24:00.255 --> 00:24:04.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we strived to develop a close relationship
with our heavenly Father.

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:07.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, over the past five months,

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:12.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our eyes have been opened
even further to God’s glory

00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:16.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as we have delved
into the deeper facets of his personality

00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:19.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through the pages of his Word.

00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:21.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How fascinating it has been

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:25.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to see how Jehovah
is not a God of random acts,

00:24:25.113 --> 00:24:28.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but One who causes to become,

00:24:28.116 --> 00:24:31.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“patiently revealing
his diversified wisdom

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in so many ways!

00:24:34.656 --> 00:24:37.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As we contemplate
the things we have learned,

00:24:37.459 --> 00:24:40.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our feelings
are like those of Job, who said:

00:24:40.862 --> 00:24:43.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My ears have heard about you,

00:24:43.598 --> 00:24:48.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but now I do see you with my eyes.’

00:24:48.503 --> 00:24:52.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What a privilege it has been
to be instructed by you,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“dear brothers of the Governing Body!

00:24:54.476 --> 00:24:58.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your humility, modesty, unity,

00:24:58.513 --> 00:25:01.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and deep love for Jehovah and his sheep

00:25:01.483 --> 00:25:05.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were clearly evident
in both your words and demeanor.

00:25:06.521 --> 00:25:09.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How touching it was for us to see!

00:25:09.357 --> 00:25:11.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although you are so busy,

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:14.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you selflessly took out time
out of your schedules

00:25:14.996 --> 00:25:17.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to teach and encourage us.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:21.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are convinced
that Jehovah is using you, dear brothers,

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:26.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a powerful way to direct
the earthly part of his organization.

00:25:26.408 --> 00:25:30.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And it is our prayer
that He continue to provide you

00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:34.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with his dynamic holy spirit
to carry out your assignment.

00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:40.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have developed a special fondness
for those selected to teach us.

00:25:40.689 --> 00:25:44.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Their teaching
did not limit itself to the classroom.

00:25:44.659 --> 00:25:49.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like Gideon, who said:
‘Watch me and do exactly what I do,’

00:25:49.497 --> 00:25:53.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they were living examples
of the things they taught.

00:25:53.235 --> 00:25:56.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Their counsel was always given in love,

00:25:56.471 --> 00:26:01.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and their experiences
always accompanied valuable life lessons.

00:26:01.443 --> 00:26:03.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We love you, dear brothers,

00:26:03.912 --> 00:26:06.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and will treasure the time we had with you.

00:26:07.582 --> 00:26:09.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We also love and treasure

00:26:09.584 --> 00:26:13.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the dear brothers and sisters
of the United States Bethel family.

00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:18.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our training began even before
ever stepping foot in the classroom.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From the moment we arrived,
we experienced your love and hospitality.

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:28.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Prior to coming to Gilead,
we’d heard about your love.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But now we have seen and felt it.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You, brothers and sisters,
truly are a gift from Jehovah,

00:26:35.644 --> 00:26:39.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:43.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, as we move on
to our various assignments,

00:26:43.151 --> 00:26:45.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the words of the apostle Paul

00:26:45.387 --> 00:26:47.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at 2 Corinthians 6:1

00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:50.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“echo in our minds and hearts,

00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:52.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as he urged fellow Christians

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘not to accept the undeserved kindness
of God and miss its purpose.’

00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:58.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The purpose of Gilead

00:26:58.733 --> 00:27:01.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is to strengthen
and stabilize the brotherhood,

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that is our determination.

00:27:05.307 --> 00:27:07.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like the apostle Paul,

00:27:07.075 --> 00:27:09.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we are determined
to impart to our brothers

00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:13.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not only the things that we have learned

00:27:13.148 --> 00:27:15.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but also our very selves,’

00:27:15.183 --> 00:27:19.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all to the glory and honor
of our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:24.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please accept this expression
of our warm love for you.

00:27:24.826 --> 00:27:28.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your brothers, the 152nd class of Gilead.”

00:27:41.209 --> 00:27:44.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s been a privilege
to be able to come and visit you

00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:49.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give some lectures for your Gilead class,
and I’ve always enjoyed it.

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:51.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now I have a special privilege

00:27:51.353 --> 00:27:53.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak (first time)

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:56.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the graduates of the 152nd class.

00:27:56.891 --> 00:27:59.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
That seems like an awesome thought,
doesn’t it?

00:27:59.694 --> 00:28:02.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re glad that you made it this far.

00:28:02.464 --> 00:28:06.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know there’s been a lot of hard work
that has gone into it.

00:28:06.468 --> 00:28:10.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
So what final comments
would we like to give you?

00:28:10.438 --> 00:28:15.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had so many good things
on the program already today, haven’t we?

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even if we were a little bit overwhelmed

00:28:18.513 --> 00:28:21.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you were worried
about certain aspects of the program,

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
at least you can watch it
on JW Broadcasting® later

00:28:25.487 --> 00:28:28.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
and get the main points.

00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:32.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember in the beginning,
we talked about the need for us to be modest

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be enthusiastic but patient.

00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:41.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we remember
how Jesus set a wonderful example for us

00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:45.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
in acknowledging humbly
that he had an assignment

00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:48.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he put
that assignment first in his life.

00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:51.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he also showed wonderful balance,
didn’t he?

00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:56.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Syrophoenician woman
begged him to help her,

00:28:56.017 --> 00:29:00.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of her expression of faith
and accepting him as the Messiah,

00:29:00.288 --> 00:29:02.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was willing to be flexible.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:06.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a wonderful blessing she got!

00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:11.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the Roman officer
and the Samaritan woman

00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:15.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all these people were ones who, really,

00:29:15.236 --> 00:29:18.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
technically weren’t part of his territory.

00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:20.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet they got wonderful blessings

00:29:20.809 --> 00:29:24.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they asked specially for some help.

00:29:24.813 --> 00:29:27.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what are the lessons for us?

00:29:27.315 --> 00:29:29.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe before we go on to the lessons,

00:29:29.551 --> 00:29:32.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can think of some
of the other non-Israelites

00:29:32.954 --> 00:29:35.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
who gained some benefit from Jesus’ ministry.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who else would you think of?

00:29:37.792 --> 00:29:41.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Pontius Pilate

00:29:41.095 --> 00:29:43.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those in his court?

00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:46.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he had all these discussions,

00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:48.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, now, I’m not telling you

00:29:48.837 --> 00:29:50.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Pontius Pilate benefited from it.

00:29:50.472 --> 00:29:54.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do see
that he had a wonderful opportunity

00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:58.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
—didn’t he?—
because he was a sort of person

00:29:58.913 --> 00:30:00.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was a very violent man,

00:30:00.748 --> 00:30:04.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
a person who at the drop of a hat
would have someone executed.

00:30:04.085 --> 00:30:05.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet what do we see?

00:30:05.386 --> 00:30:07.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over and over again,

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:12.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
he seemed to try
and avoid sentencing Jesus to death.

00:30:12.193 --> 00:30:14.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know that something impressed him.

00:30:14.195 --> 00:30:16.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, is this one of the times

00:30:16.197 --> 00:30:19.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus spoke in Greek to him
or some other language?

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:20.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:30:20.468 --> 00:30:22.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not speculating,

00:30:22.737 --> 00:30:26.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do know that he was very impressed.

00:30:26.608 --> 00:30:29.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about those
who were there listening?

00:30:29.644 --> 00:30:31.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a lot going on.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember later
when Jesus actually died,

00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:37.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a centurion.

00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:43.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this centurion acknowledged
that this was the Son of God.

00:30:43.892 --> 00:30:45.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note, if you check it later,

00:30:45.693 --> 00:30:49.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
says maybe he was there with Pontius Pilate.

00:30:49.163 --> 00:30:51.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Makes sense, doesn’t it?

00:30:51.065 --> 00:30:54.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was perhaps in charge of organizing this.

00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:58.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that man got a tremendous benefit

00:30:58.506 --> 00:31:02.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
from at least seeing Jesus
and hearing his testimony

00:31:02.744 --> 00:31:06.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a non-Israelite
but someone who gained benefit.

00:31:06.347 --> 00:31:09.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then finally,
what about those two Roman soldiers

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
who witnessed the resurrection?

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:12.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, they didn’t have a chance

00:31:12.186 --> 00:31:14.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk to Jesus, as far as we know,

00:31:14.222 --> 00:31:15.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they did see the angel

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
roll back the stone.

00:31:17.592 --> 00:31:19.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an impact that would have had

00:31:19.394 --> 00:31:21.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their lives!

00:31:21.596 --> 00:31:25.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
So thinking about these ones
that we’ve just discussed,

00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:26.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do we see?

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:29.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you go back to your assignments,

00:31:29.037 --> 00:31:32.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we mentioned, there’ll be the temptation

00:31:32.106 --> 00:31:35.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get yourself involved
with everything that is going on

00:31:35.577 --> 00:31:38.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to visit the 90 islands, to get a ship.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I know you’re not going to do that,

00:31:41.049 --> 00:31:43.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the temptation will be there

00:31:43.284 --> 00:31:47.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
to sort of see the need
to help as many people as possible.

00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:49.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s the point?

00:31:49.657 --> 00:31:51.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, you have an assignment.

00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:54.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one of you now
has a specific assignment.

00:31:54.062 --> 00:31:55.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Put that first.

00:31:55.496 --> 00:31:58.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be faithful and loyal to Jehovah.

00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:01.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apply all these things
that you’ve not only heard in Gilead

00:32:01.469 --> 00:32:03.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also in today’s program.

00:32:03.471 --> 00:32:05.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then be patient.

00:32:05.206 --> 00:32:09.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leave it to Jehovah.
Remember, it’s Jehovah’s work, isn’t it?

00:32:09.444 --> 00:32:12.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember one dear brother
of the Governing Body

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
made a comment once, you know,
when he was facing a difficult situation.

00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:20.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just looked and said,
“It’s Jehovah’s problem.”

00:32:21.222 --> 00:32:23.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, and that’s what we need to recognize.

00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:26.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some things we leave to Jehovah.

00:32:26.327 --> 00:32:30.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as you go,
we wish you Jehovah’s blessing.

00:32:30.164 --> 00:32:34.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,
be enthusiastic but also be patient.
