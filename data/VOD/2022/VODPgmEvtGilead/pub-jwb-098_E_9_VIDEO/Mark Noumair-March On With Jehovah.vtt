00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:05.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young man received his assignment,

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was not for the faint of heart.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:12.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would have to tell
about the desolation of cherished cities,

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
the burning of Jehovah’s temple,
and the captivity of his people.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for delivering these messages
(which they were not easy),

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would endure

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:28.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
scathing and murderous attempts on his life.

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, on top of that,

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:36.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would experience
moments of discouragement,

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:38.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
isolation,

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:40.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
self-doubt.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
When receiving his assignment,
this young man said:

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah, I cannot do this.

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:50.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just a boy.’

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
The boy was from Anathoth,

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:58.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his name was Jeremiah.

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:03.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what would help him
be successful with this assignment?

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:06.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be following and taking to heart

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
the very points that Brother Fleegle
brought out about faith.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:15.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would need a deep, abiding faith
and trust in Jehovah.

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in addition to that,

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would need to learn how to march.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:27.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah was ready to enter
the front lines of the battle

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:34.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the battle to defend pure worship
against those who hate it.

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:36.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like any good soldier,

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:40.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the first things you learn
is how to march.

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:46.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, marching is more challenging
than mere walking.

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:49.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Marching requires determination.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
It requires stamina, endurance,

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to keep moving forward

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:00.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a regular, steady step.

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:05.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Jeremiah entered this battle,

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would need to learn how to march.

00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:11.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would help him?

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:15.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recalling what was written in God’s Word
centuries before his time,

00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:19.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
words recorded at Deuteronomy 31:6.

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:21.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to read these words to you.

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
These words were so important to Jeremiah.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
The context was when Moses was encouraging

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:31.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
confidence in Jehovah.

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:35.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
The nation of Israel was ready
to enter into the Promised Land.

00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:36.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would face enemies.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would face a fight, a battle.

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:44.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look at what Moses says
in verse 6 of Deuteronomy 31:

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:48.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be courageous and strong.

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid
or struck with terror before them,

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for Jehovah your God

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:57.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is the one marching with you.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:59.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[He’s marching with you.]

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will neither desert you nor abandon you.”

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Jehovah march alongside this boy?

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:14.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Jeremiah 1:8,
Jehovah tells Jeremiah:

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:19.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid
because of their appearance,

00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:22.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ‘I am with you to save you.’”

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be afraid.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:28.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
when a person marches with Jehovah,

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:32.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see, Jehovah marches with him,

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
boosting him along, making him strong.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s as if Jehovah told Jeremiah,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t worry,
you just come and march with me.’

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:46.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for the next 67 years,
that’s exactly what Jeremiah did

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s strength.

00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:51.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what happened
in Jehovah’s strength.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah preached to hard-hearted people,

00:03:54.884 --> 00:03:58.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
including wicked kings,
corrupt priests, apostates.

00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:00.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did it, and as he marched,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saw Jehovah march with him.

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:05.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was conscious of that fact.

00:04:07.897 --> 00:04:12.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saved him
when imprisoned in a dungeon.

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:16.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah supplied him
a daily ration of food during a famine.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah rescued him from a cistern.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, this was real.

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:25.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was tangible.
This was concrete.

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:26.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t made-up.

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:29.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was marching with him.

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:32.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Jeremiah saw Jehovah’s support,

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:35.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
it strengthened him
and it gave him more confidence,

00:04:35.558 --> 00:04:37.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah marched with him.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Jeremiah was ready
for the next trial.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we bring this up?

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:49.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because your situation
is very similar to Jeremiah’s.

00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:51.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:56.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with your Gilead training,
you are being put on the front lines.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to be asked
to defend pure worship,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe like you never have before.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:07.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want you to stay in the battle.

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:10.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want you to keep marching.

00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:13.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, what if in your assignment,

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
opposition turns into outright persecution?

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or what if in your branch territory,

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
you face political upheaval or war?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if you need

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:30.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
to risk your lives

00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:32.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide relief

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
like our brothers in and around Ukraine
are doing?

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if that happens?

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:43.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your brothers will be looking to you
as an example.

00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:45.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you be able to set that example?

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you maintain that example?

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you can.

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:53.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because when you march with Jehovah

00:05:53.703 --> 00:05:56.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
—now listen carefully

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you march with Jehovah,

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:03.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
he does something very special for you
in moments of weakness.

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:07.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, consider what happened to Jeremiah.

00:06:07.984 --> 00:06:11.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one point,
it got so bad that he wanted to quit.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m quitting.’

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 20:9:

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m not going to mention Jehovah’s name.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m not going to talk about it anymore.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m discouraged.
I’m tired.

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:22.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m exhausted.
I’m going to stop marching.’

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was losing his focus.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does Jehovah help him?
What did Jehovah do?

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:31.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he say, ‘Well, Jeremiah, that’s it.

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:35.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re going to be exhausted,
I’ll find another prophet.’

00:06:35.278 --> 00:06:38.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah did not do that.

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:39.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah do?

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is a thought
we want you to take to heart,

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:47.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 20:11.

00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:50.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah help him to keep marching?

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:55.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Jehovah was with me

00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:58.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[like a what, friend?

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like a brother?
No, no, no.]

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:04.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
like a fearsome warrior.”

00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in what way
did Jehovah prove to be a fearsome warrior,

00:07:08.778 --> 00:07:12.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
a mighty soldier,
standing right at Jeremiah’s side?

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah do that?

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:20.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what happens in battle?

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:23.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a soldier sees
a fellow soldier stumble and fall,

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:24.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does he do?

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rushes to his side; he supports him;

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:28.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
he grabs him;
they go together;

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:31.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wraps his arm around him,
and they move to safety together.

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:34.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what Jehovah did for Jeremiah.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:39.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jeremiah tells us this

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:41.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
in chapter 20, and in verse 7.

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:43.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jeremiah say?

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:45.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
He experienced this.

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:47.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says:

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You used your strength against me,

00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:52.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you prevailed.”

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:54.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You used your strength against me.”

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:07:58.027 --> 00:08:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah used his strength
against Jeremiah’s weakness.

00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:05.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing Jehovah do this for him

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:08.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
time and again, time and again,

00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:10.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
enabled Jeremiah to accomplish

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:12.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he could have never accomplished
on his own.

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:16.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the point we’re making for you.

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:20.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these experiences
strengthen and transform

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:22.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
his natural shyness,

00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:24.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
his feelings of inadequacy,

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:26.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his lack of confidence

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:29.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
into ironlike boldness.

00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:31.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was with him
like a fearsome warrior.

00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:35.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved the commission
he gave Jeremiah.

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:38.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was working with Jeremiah
to fulfill this commission.

00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:40.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was precious to Jehovah.

00:08:40.903 --> 00:08:44.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like your commission,
it’s precious to Jehovah.

00:08:46.542 --> 00:08:50.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you can be assured
that Jehovah is going to do the same for you.

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:53.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want you to have that confidence.

00:08:53.349 --> 00:08:56.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, one sister,

00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:59.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
who not long ago graduated from Gilead,

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced this firsthand.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:08.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after arriving in her assignment,
she was arrested.

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:12.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister was held captive
in a dungeonlike prison.

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:17.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during that time,
she was given meager rations of food

00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:21.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was subjected
to painful, prolonged punishment.

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:23.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
How was she able to endure?

00:09:23.212 --> 00:09:24.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could she stay strong?

00:09:24.947 --> 00:09:26.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:09:26.082 --> 00:09:28.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
By marching with Jehovah.

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:33.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she never lost sight of the fact
that she was part of an army of marchers.

00:09:33.122 --> 00:09:36.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was marching with the fearsome Warrior.

00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:38.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, this is what she said:

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:44.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thinking about my Gilead classmates

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:48.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and visualizing their faces gave me power.

00:09:49.438 --> 00:09:53.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I kept their smiling faces in front of me.

00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:55.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I imagined where each classmate sat

00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:58.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—each row from left to right—
front to back.

00:09:59.882 --> 00:10:04.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I recalled where they were from,
what work they did in their assignments.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:08.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This made the time go by quickly,
and I felt no physical pain at all.

00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:13.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I sang in my head Kingdom songs.

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The song I sang the most
was ‘Jehovah Is Your Name.’

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Another song that touched my heart deeply

00:10:21.304 --> 00:10:25.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was song number 38,
‘He Will Make You Strong.’

00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:28.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I made that song more personal

00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:33.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by replacing the pronoun ‘you’ with ‘me.’

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:36.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This song helped me never to give up.

00:10:38.287 --> 00:10:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I had no Bible.

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So each day, I meditated on Bible teachings

00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:47.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“such as everlasting life in Paradise
and a resurrection hope.

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:50.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These meditations gave me deep inner joy

00:10:50.266 --> 00:10:54.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a calm that cannot be described.

00:10:54.637 --> 00:10:58.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At times, I thought about the possibility
of facing death,

00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:02.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the fear of death did not consume me.”

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, she thought about the possibility
of facing death,

00:11:08.317 --> 00:11:12.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the fear of death did not consume her.

00:11:14.056 --> 00:11:17.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fearsome Warrior, Jehovah,
was marching with her.

00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:22.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
No prison walls, no bars
can block Jehovah from marching with her.

00:11:22.498 --> 00:11:27.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our sister was recently released
from prison.

00:11:29.672 --> 00:11:31.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever your trials,

00:11:31.707 --> 00:11:34.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t know
what trials you’re going to face.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t know.
We don’t know.

00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:40.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
But reflect on how Jehovah supports you.

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay in the battle.

00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:44.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you reflect
on how Jehovah supports you,

00:11:44.487 --> 00:11:46.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s tangible, it’s real, it’s concrete.

00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:47.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about that.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will never stop marching with you.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, you are part of a large army.

00:11:55.097 --> 00:11:56.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not alone.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, when you see
a fellow worshipper struggling,

00:12:01.737 --> 00:12:03.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t ignore them.

00:12:03.739 --> 00:12:06.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help them not to fall behind.

00:12:06.075 --> 00:12:07.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help them.

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:08.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help them.

00:12:08.744 --> 00:12:10.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re part of an army.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve been trained to do this.

00:12:12.882 --> 00:12:15.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what school taught you:

00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:18.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be independent,
but to be interdependent,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
not independen—interdependent
with your brothers and sisters.

00:12:23.058 --> 00:12:25.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s your job.

00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:27.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be quick to help them back up.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep marching with Jehovah.

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:35.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although you don’t know
what challenges lie ahead,

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:37.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are prepared.

00:12:37.973 --> 00:12:41.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with your marching orders in hand,

00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:44.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
be courageous and strong,

00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:48.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that each trial you face,
each trial you endure,

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
will make you stronger for the next one.

00:12:51.654 --> 00:12:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be confident that you will always have
the fearsome Warrior,

00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:59.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mighty Soldier marching by your side.

00:12:59.428 --> 00:13:01.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s there, Jehovah.

00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:05.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now go

00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:07.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever the battle may take you.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go,

00:13:09.638 --> 00:13:12.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be determined to fulfill your commission

00:13:12.308 --> 00:13:15.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support your brothers

00:13:15.578 --> 00:13:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you march on with Jehovah.
