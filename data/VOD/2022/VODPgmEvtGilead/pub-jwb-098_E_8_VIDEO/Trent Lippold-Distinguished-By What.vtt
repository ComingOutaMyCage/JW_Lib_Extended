00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:02.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a mighty man.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felled the heroes of the enemy.

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:10.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
He slayed a giant.
He even killed a lion.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:13.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his name was not David.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was he?

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:19.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open your Bibles with me, please,
to the book of 1 Chronicles chapter 11

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:24.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Chronicles 11:22:

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Benaiah the son of Jehoiada

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was a courageous man who performed

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“many exploits in Kabzeel.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:39.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He struck down
the two sons of Ariel of Moab,

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:43.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he descended into a waterpit
on a snowy day and killed a lion.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:48.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He also struck down an Egyptian man
of extraordinary size

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—five cubits tall.

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:53.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the beam of loom workers,

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he went against him with a rod

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:00.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and snatched the spear away
from the Egyptian’s hand

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and killed him with his own spear.”

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is Benaiah.

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:12.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at all we learn about him
in these verses,

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:15.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
the qualities that Benaiah displayed.

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:20.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
It tells us in verse 22
that he “was a courageous man.”

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:24.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
He “performed many exploits in Kabzeel.”

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kabzeel—Kabzeel is a small place

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:30.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the very southern border of Judah.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
It borders Edom in the middle of nowhere.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Benaiah worked there.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was happy to be there.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:41.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be that that was his home.

00:01:41.484 --> 00:01:44.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or it may be that that was his assignment.

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:48.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter,
as obscure a place as Kabzeel is,

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:50.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s where he worked.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:52.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the record says that he performed

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:55.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
many exploits courageously in Kabzeel.

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:01.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
He killed a lion—courage.

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you notice
that “he descended into a waterpit . . .

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:07.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
and killed a lion”?

00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:09.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courage.

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
He descended into a waterpit
with a lion.

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:15.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s only one coming out,
and it was Benaiah.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He descended into a waterpit
on a snowy day.”

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t wait for the sun to shine.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that was the day
—adverse conditions, no matter.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah went in, and he slayed the lion.

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at verse 23,
some more amazing qualities.

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:35.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
He struck down the giant,
‘an Egyptian of extraordinary size.’

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:38.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice this: “Though the Egyptian
had a spear in his hand

00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:41.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the beam of loom workers,
he [Benaiah]

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:45.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
went against him with a rod”—a rod, a stick.

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t have the right equipment

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
—courage, adaptability, commitment.

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:54.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice this.
What does he do?

00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:59.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “He went against him with a rod
and snatched the spear away

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Egyptian’s hand
and killed him with his own spear.”

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courage, commitment,
adaptability, resourcefulness

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:12.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these are admirable, beneficial qualities.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are those the qualities
that distinguished Benaiah?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not entirely.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:23.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was one quality that exceeded these,

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:25.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that quality was loyalty

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:31.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
—tenacious adherence
to the person of Jehovah.

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:35.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the Bible record reveals
about Benaiah:

00:03:35.398 --> 00:03:37.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a caution, though, with loyalty.

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:46.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
The demarcation

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:51.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
between loyalty to Jehovah
and loyalty to self

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
can often be blurry.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
It hides under the inertia

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:04.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
of imperfection and selfishness.

00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:08.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
That line of loyalty to Jehovah
versus loyalty to self

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:12.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
can become very difficult to see.

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, loyalty to self
can lie dormant within us

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:21.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the circumstances arise and change,

00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then it can emerge.

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:26.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Benaiah and his contemporaries

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:29.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
provide for us a beautiful contrast

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
in loyalty to Jehovah and loyalty to self.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:39.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of Benaiah.
He lived in a very tumultuous time.

00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:41.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
David was a fugitive with his mighty men.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of them likely was Benaiah, among others.

00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:48.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men were comrades in arms
running with David.

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:50.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were a band of brothers.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were fiercely loyal to David

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, to be sure,
they were loyal to Jehovah as well.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, among these three mighty men

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:03.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
were three brothers, fleshly brothers.

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:06.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re mentioned in verses 20 and 26:

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:17.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now consider when circumstances changed
for the mighty men,

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:22.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Saul died and David now became king,

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
in these changing circumstances,

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened to the mighty men?

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:34.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the contrast: Joab and Benaiah.

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:36.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened to Joab?

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:41.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joab saw opportunity
in changing circumstances,

00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:46.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his loyalty to Jehovah was eclipsed

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
by his loyalty to himself.

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:51.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:55.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was Joab who took matters
into his own hands,

00:05:55.838 --> 00:05:58.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he killed Abner

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom David
had already concluded a covenant.

00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:04.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took matters into his own hands.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?
He wanted Abner’s job.

00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:12.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
His selfish ambitions got the better of him,

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:15.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they eclipsed his loyalty to Jehovah.

00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:17.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joab was a courageous man.

00:06:17.493 --> 00:06:18.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was resourceful.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was adaptable.

00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:22.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Admirable qualities.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:26.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the absence
of deep personal loyalty to Jehovah,

00:06:27.837 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
they seem somehow tainted, don’t they?

00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
But consider Benaiah
in the same circumstances.

00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:39.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah had no part in these kind
of intrigues like Joab and his brothers.

00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:42.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah was loyal to Jehovah,
and he was a loyal man

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s anointed one, David.

00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:49.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at what we find in verses 24 and 25,

00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:55.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 24 and 25: “These things
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did,

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:59.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he had a reputation
like that of the three mighty warriors.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although he was distinguished
even more than the thirty,

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:07.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he did not attain to the rank of the three.

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:12.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, David appointed him
over his own bodyguard.”

00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:19.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, in the same circumstances as Joab,

00:07:19.288 --> 00:07:22.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah’s tenacious adherence to Jehovah

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:24.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah—

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
safeguarded him in these circumstances.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:31.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did David see in Benaiah?

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
David saw in Benaiah
what he himself exemplified,

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:41.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was deep and strong personal loyalty
to Jehovah.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see that in this verse,
in verse 25, can’t you?

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:49.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “However, David appointed him
over his own bodyguard.”

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:51.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
David knew that to assign someone

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this very, very trusted position

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
(head of his own bodyguard),
the man in that position,

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:03.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he was loyal to Jehovah,
would be loyal to him.

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what David saw in Benaiah.

00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then came another time of change
decades later.

00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:15.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David died and Solomon became king

00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
—changed circumstances,
another time of opportunity—

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:23.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
how would Benaiah react?

00:08:23.052 --> 00:08:25.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same way he always did:

00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:29.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
deep personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:33.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was Solomon when he became king

00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:36.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
who rewarded Benaiah.

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:39.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
The son of David, Solomon,
Jehovah’s anointed,

00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:42.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
rewarded Benaiah for his loyalty.

00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:47.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Proverbs 19:22.

00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:51.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Solomon
knew something about loyalty.

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:54.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was the son of David.

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:58.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at what he wrote about loyalty
at Proverbs 19:22.

00:08:58.854 --> 00:09:02.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon said: “The desirable thing in a man

00:09:02.258 --> 00:09:04.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
is his loyal love.”

00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:09.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
His loyalty
—that’s what Jehovah looks for in us.

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:14.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Benaiah was indeed a mighty man,

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had beautiful qualities.

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:20.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they distinguish him?

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:22.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not entirely.

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
first and foremost that distinguished him.

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:32.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of that deep personal loyalty
to Jehovah,

00:09:32.588 --> 00:09:36.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
those qualities of Benaiah were beautiful.

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:42.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
So daily cultivate your loyalty to God

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:44.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
through prayer and study.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s been your training here.

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:51.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use your training to develop
your close personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Benaiah did.
Think of Benaiah’s training.

00:09:56.646 --> 00:09:58.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was the son of Jehoiada.

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:03.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoiada was
one of the chief Levitical priests in Israel.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:08.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benaiah was raised with scrolls,
not with swords.

00:10:08.057 --> 00:10:12.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up as the son of a priest,
that was his training.

00:10:13.996 --> 00:10:16.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
So like Benaiah,

00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:19.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
be willing to do the work without the rank.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, loyalty is tested
not when you are at ease.

00:10:24.807 --> 00:10:27.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loyalty is tested under adversity.

00:10:27.677 --> 00:10:31.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be careful in changing circumstances.

00:10:31.147 --> 00:10:32.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guard your hearts.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear students,
you all have beautiful qualities.

00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:39.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve seen them over the last five months.

00:10:39.989 --> 00:10:42.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
But may loyalty,

00:10:42.158 --> 00:10:46.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
may your deep personal loyalty to Jehovah,

00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:48.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
distinguish you.
