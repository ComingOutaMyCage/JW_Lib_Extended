00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:05.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will be going home
or to a new assignment.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:08.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want you to know that you will be missed.

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:12.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was good for the Bethel family
to have you with us.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a blessing from Jehovah.

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:20.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a pregnant woman,
your bellies are swelled to the limit.

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:22.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the signs tell you

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:26.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a baby is about to be born.

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:29.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re rushed to see the doctor.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
He examines you.

00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:33.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you ask, “When?”

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:36.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says, “Any day now.”

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your minds and hearts are about to burst

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
with spiritual things to deliver to others.

00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:48.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, this is a day for delivering.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your spirituality is contagious.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you walk into a room,
you bring sunshine with you.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what Jesus said
to some of his followers

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:01.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 5:14-16:

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:05.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are the light of the world.

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A city cannot be hid

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:09.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when located on a mountain.

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:12.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“People light a lamp and set it,

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not under a basket,

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but on the lampstand,

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:20.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it shines on all those in the house.

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:24.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Likewise, let your light shine before men,

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they may see your fine works

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:30.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and give glory to your Father

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is in the heavens.”

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:37.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all,
your spiritual brothers and sisters

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in the house with you.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:45.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shine on them, but don’t limit it to them.

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:48.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want others to see the light.

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:51.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the past five months,

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:55.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have been studying
the personality of Jehovah

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:58.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking to him by means of prayer.

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:02.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:07.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans cannot see
the literal Person, Jehovah.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Jehovah God to set down

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:14.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
a description of himself in spirit terms

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be like trying to explain colors

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a person born blind.

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:25.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have been asking for him
to help you in your studies,

00:02:25.662 --> 00:02:28.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has helped you.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:33.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without his help,
you would not be graduating.

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:37.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re ready as never before

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:39.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let your light shine

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:43.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your fleshly family members,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
your Bible students,

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:48.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:53.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t make it so bright and intense

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you put out the eyes
of those around you.

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:01.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn the wick down in your lamp.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no need to say every time:

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were taught this in Gilead.”

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:14.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were taught this
in one of our Gilead classes.”

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:17.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A member of the Governing Body
called this to our attention

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:19.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a lecture he gave.”

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:25.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
You knew some things
before you came to Gilead.

00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:28.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
You knew that God’s name is Jehovah

00:03:28.858 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that it is unique,

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:34.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
meaning the only one of its kind.

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:38.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Sam,

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:41.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuel, or Sammy.

00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:44.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not unique.

00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:47.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many others with the same name.

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:50.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was named after my father’s brother

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Uncle Sam.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you get that, Uncle Sam?

00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did not name myself.

00:03:57.854 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
A baby doesn’t say, after eight months
in his mother’s womb,

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:06.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mommy, when I get out,
call me Sammy.”

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
God Almighty chose his name, Jehovah.

00:04:12.302 --> 00:04:14.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
He named himself.

00:04:15.438 --> 00:04:19.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is different; that is unique.

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:25.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
You Gilead students,
soon to be a Gilead graduates,

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:29.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
know Jehovah but not completely,

00:04:29.218 --> 00:04:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
not the whole Person, just the fringe.

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:38.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Compare what you see to an ornamental edging

00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:41.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
of hanging threads of a garment.

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:44.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t see the whole garment.

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:48.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 11:33-36 says:

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:51.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O the depth

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge!

00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:57.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How unsearchable his judgments are

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and beyond tracing out his ways are!

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:06.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For ‘who has come to know Jehovah’s mind,

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or who has become his adviser?’

00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:14.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or, ‘who has first given to him,

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that it must be repaid to him?’

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because from him and by him and for him

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:24.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are all things.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To him be the glory forever.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amen.”

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job 36:26

00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:35.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us: “Yes, God

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:38.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is greater than we can know;

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:40.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the number of his years

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:42.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
is beyond comprehension.”

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how much knowledge
we have accumulated in our brain,

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:53.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
it amounts to a grain of sand on a seashore

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we live forever.

00:05:56.672 --> 00:05:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Forever”?

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:01.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is an interesting word.

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:05.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is defined as “never-ending,

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:07.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“incessantly,

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
ceaseless.”

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s enough to blow
an imperfect man’s mind away

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not Jehovah’s mind.

00:06:18.494 --> 00:06:20.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he promises obedient humans

00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:25.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
everlasting, never-ending, life.

00:06:27.904 --> 00:06:31.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to read a scripture to you
without revealing

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:33.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it is found in the Bible.

00:06:34.877 --> 00:06:37.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is one of the first
that captured my attention

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:40.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
back in 1956.

00:06:40.516 --> 00:06:42.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was before any of you were born.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:47.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that I heard a loud voice

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the throne say: ‘Look!

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The tent of God is with mankind,

00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:57.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and he will reside with them,

00:06:57.066 --> 00:07:00.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and they will be his people.

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:03.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And God himself with be with them.

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:07.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And he will wipe out every tear
from their eyes,

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and death will be no more,

00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:14.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘neither will mourning nor outcry

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘nor pain be anymore.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
The former things have passed away.’”

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:24.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where is it in the Bible?

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:27.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 21:3, 4.

00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:31.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew you would know that one.

00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:34.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are limited
to how much knowledge our brains

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
can understand and sort out correctly.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:40.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, one day

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will know much more than we know today.

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:48.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we will not know it all.

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s good.

00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:53.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will never be a know-it-all.

00:07:55.992 --> 00:08:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time to let your light shine.

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:02.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our work at the present

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:06.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to inform people
that the Kingdom of God,

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
a heavenly government,

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:10.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the only remedy

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the woes of mankind, which are causing

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:16.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
so much suffering and death.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inform people of the Kingdom,

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:24.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
but don’t blind them with your bright light

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
of knowledge learned at Gilead.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little light will be enough

00:08:31.227 --> 00:08:33.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
for them to see where to go.

00:08:35.398 --> 00:08:39.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was in the army in Germany years ago,

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:42.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
I drove a truck with five men inside

00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an M101 howitzer artillery gun

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:50.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
attached to the rear of the truck.

00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:54.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
We traveled during a pitch-dark night
with no lights used.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could only see the tail light

00:08:57.887 --> 00:09:01.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the vehicle in front.

00:09:01.023 --> 00:09:05.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was enough light to follow.

00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:07.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
there may not be enough time left

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:15.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your students
and new brothers and sisters

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:19.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn all that you know.

00:09:19.609 --> 00:09:22.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feed them not a heavy meal

00:09:22.912 --> 00:09:25.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
of steak and baked potatoes

00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:27.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
but an appetizer

00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:31.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stimulate the juices in the mouth.

00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:35.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any day now

00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
nations will cause the peoples

00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:42.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are looking to them for guidance to think 

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:46.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have finally established peace.

00:09:47.703 --> 00:09:52.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
The need for peace is already
being talked about by national leaders.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are not fooled by this sham cry

00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:01.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
of “Peace and security!”

00:10:01.117 --> 00:10:03.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Thessalonians 5:3 says:

00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:07.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:09.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:12.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then sudden destruction

00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:15.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is to be instantly on them,

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:18.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just like birth pains

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:21.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on a pregnant woman,

00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:24.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

00:10:26.008 --> 00:10:29.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will have
the political powers of this world

00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:32.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
turn against Babylon the Great

00:10:32.248 --> 00:10:34.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
(that’s false religion).

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
After they see the handwriting
on the wall for her

00:10:38.988 --> 00:10:42.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and destroy her

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:46.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
(“sudden destruction” instantly

00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it won’t take long),

00:10:48.698 --> 00:10:51.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
her supporters will cry out,

00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:53.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
weeping and mourning, and say,

00:10:53.936 --> 00:10:57.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Too bad, too bad!”

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we will be thinking,

00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:03.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m glad; I’m glad!’

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 18:20 says:

00:11:07.283 --> 00:11:10.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be glad over her, O heaven,

00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:12.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“also you holy ones

00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:15.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and apostles and prophets,

00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:18.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because God has pronounced his judgment

00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:22.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
on her in your behalf!”

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:24.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:11:25.334 --> 00:11:29.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready
to “be glad over her” destruction?

00:11:31.374 --> 00:11:33.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think you are.

00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:37.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I can’t make that determination.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will know if we were ready

00:11:40.983 --> 00:11:43.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah protects us

00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:47.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the nations turn their guns on us.

00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time

00:11:51.394 --> 00:11:54.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to continue strengthening
our faith and trust

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s love for us.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Study, meditate,

00:12:01.404 --> 00:12:05.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
associate, and preach the Kingdom.

00:12:07.176 --> 00:12:11.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young David, when facing Goliath,

00:12:11.013 --> 00:12:15.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
had five smooth stones in his pouch,

00:12:17.386 --> 00:12:19.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pouch of his shepherd’s bag.

00:12:20.222 --> 00:12:22.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
He only used one,

00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was prepared in case he needed more.

00:12:27.296 --> 00:12:31.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we read the Bible and meditate on it,

00:12:31.434 --> 00:12:36.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
our figurative heart absorbs God’s Word.

00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:39.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like putting symbolic stones

00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:41.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our figurative heart,

00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:45.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
this gives us the inner strength we need

00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:48.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach the Kingdom message now

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:52.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to proclaim
the hard-hitting judgment message

00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we may deliver in the near future.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day for salvation will be closed

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
any day now.

00:13:05.334 --> 00:13:08.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Noah had gathered all the creatures

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:10.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah had designated,

00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:12.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with all necessary food

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed for all in the ark,

00:13:15.444 --> 00:13:17.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
they went into the ark.

00:13:18.814 --> 00:13:23.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note, it was Jehovah who closed the door,
not Noah.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 7:16 says:

00:13:27.156 --> 00:13:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they went in, male and female

00:13:29.692 --> 00:13:31.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of every sort of flesh,

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:34.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as God had commanded him.

00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:37.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that Jehovah

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:40.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
shut the door behind him.”

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t take it upon ourselves

00:13:42.438 --> 00:13:44.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
to close the door to salvation.

00:13:44.673 --> 00:13:46.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah shuts the door,

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:51.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can’t push it open
to let Mom or anyone else in.

00:13:52.948 --> 00:13:56.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
You Gileadites
are professional preachers and teachers.

00:13:56.785 --> 00:14:00.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have received training
that not many of your brothers and sisters

00:14:00.723 --> 00:14:03.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have the privilege to receive

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this side of Armageddon.

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:09.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, without a doubt, you are wiser now

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
than you used to be

00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:15.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not as wise as Jesus was

00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:20.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he said: “What I teach is not mine,

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:25.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
but belongs to him who sent me.”—John 7:16.

00:14:26.215 --> 00:14:29.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
We believe Jehovah sent you to Gilead.

00:14:31.387 --> 00:14:33.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep foremost in mind

00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:37.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what you teach belongs to Jehovah,

00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:41.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conduct yourselves
in a manner that displays that.

00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:46.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let your light shine, not too brightly,

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:50.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just a flicker,
as needed before nightfall

00:14:50.773 --> 00:14:53.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
—any day now.
