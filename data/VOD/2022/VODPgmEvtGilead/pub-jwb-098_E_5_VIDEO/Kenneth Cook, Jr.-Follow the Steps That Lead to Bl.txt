00:00:00 To begin, I’d like to share a personal experience with you.
00:00:05 When I was told that I was appointed to be a member of the Governing Body,
00:00:10 one of the brothers who informed me said:
00:00:14 “With this assignment, you’ll experience
00:00:16 “a great increase in responsibility.
00:00:19 “But you’ll also see a corresponding increase
00:00:22 “in Jehovah’s spirit to help you.
00:00:25 It will not be too much for you.”
00:00:28 Well, those words were very, very reassuring to me.
00:00:33 And the fact is that all of us
00:00:36 (no matter who we are) serving Jehovah faithfully
00:00:39 must rely on his help
00:00:42 to succeed in serving him.
00:00:45 Now, how do we show this and receive his help?
00:00:48 There are a number of ways.
00:00:50 We’re going to focus on three of them.
00:00:52 They are these: Follow direction, show faith,
00:00:56 and use common sense, or the thinking ability,
00:01:00 that Jehovah has given to us.
00:01:02 So let’s consider the first step.
00:01:05 Sometimes all that’s required to receive Jehovah’s blessing on our work
00:01:10 is to follow simple, clear direction.
00:01:14 Now, here’s a Bible example of that.
00:01:15 It’s found in Mark chapter 14
00:01:18 —Mark chapter 14.
00:01:21 Now, you’ll recall from this account
00:01:23 that God’s Son directed two of his disciples
00:01:26 to go into Jerusalem and to prepare a large,
00:01:30 furnished upper room for the Passover.
00:01:33 His directions were specific.
00:01:35 For instance, Jesus said that they would meet
00:01:37 ‘a man carrying a large, earthenware jar,
00:01:42 and they were to follow him.’
00:01:44 And then starting in verse 14, Jesus added this,
00:01:48 he said: “Wherever he goes inside, say to the master of the house,
00:01:53 “‘The Teacher says: “Where is the guest room
00:01:55 “where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’
00:01:58 “And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready.
00:02:02 “Prepare it for us there.
00:02:04 “So the disciples went out, and they entered the city
00:02:07 “and found it just as he said to them,
00:02:10 and they prepared for the Passover.”
00:02:14 So the directions were simple, right?
00:02:17 They were told where they should go,
00:02:19 who they should follow, what they were to say,
00:02:22 and what they were to do.
00:02:24 And the two disciples promptly followed that direction,
00:02:28 and of course, their obedience brought many blessings, as we know.
00:02:32 Well, what practical lesson can you draw from this?
00:02:37 The lesson: Sometimes all that is needed in serving Jehovah
00:02:40 is to follow simple, clear direction.
00:02:43 You’ll have many opportunities to do so in your assignments.
00:02:48 Follow clear direction, and look for Jehovah’s blessing on it.
00:02:53 But now, on the other hand, you might be asked to care for something
00:02:56 that’s far more involved than that.
00:02:59 For example, what if you’re asked to assist someone
00:03:03 who’s known to be difficult to deal with?
00:03:07 Or you’re asked to care for a work-related problem
00:03:11 that others have not been able to solve.
00:03:15 You’re the one selected because you’ve had the training.
00:03:19 In such a case, what will help you?
00:03:21 Your strong faith—the next step.
00:03:24 The fact is that at times we need to show added faith to fulfill our assignments.
00:03:28 True?
00:03:29 Consider the example of Ananias.
00:03:31 Now, he too was a man of faith,
00:03:33 but he faced a challenge that required even more of him,
00:03:36 and we read about it in Acts chapter 9.
00:03:40 We’ll begin with verse 10 —Acts 9:10—
00:03:44 it says: “There was a disciple named Ananias in Damascus,
00:03:48 “and the Lord said to him in a vision: ‘Ananias!’
00:03:51 “He said: ‘Here I am, Lord.’
00:03:53 “The Lord said to him: ‘Get up, go to the street called Straight,
00:03:57 “‘and look for a man named Saul, from Tarsus,
00:04:00 “‘at the house of Judas.
00:04:02 “‘For look! he is praying,
00:04:04 “‘and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias
00:04:07 “come in and lay his hands on him so that he may recover sight.’
00:04:11 “But Ananias answered: ‘Lord,
00:04:13 “‘I have heard from many about this man,
00:04:17 “‘about all the harm he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem.
00:04:22 “‘And here he has authority from the chief priests
00:04:24 “to arrest all those calling on your name.’
00:04:27 “But the Lord said to him: ‘Go! because this man
00:04:31 “‘is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations
00:04:35 “‘as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.
00:04:38 “‘For I will show him plainly how many things
00:04:40 he must suffer for my name.’”
00:04:44 Well, the direction was clear.
00:04:46 Where should Ananias go? To the street called Straight.
00:04:50 Who was he looking for? A man named Saul.
00:04:53 What house is he in? The house of Judas.
00:04:56 Ananias was even told what Saul was doing.
00:04:59 He was praying.
00:05:02 Then Ananias was told what he should do.
00:05:05 He was to lay his hands on him so that he would recover sight.
00:05:09 Simple, right?
00:05:11 Jesus would do the rest.
00:05:13 What a great example of giving clear direction!
00:05:17 But here is where Ananias needed to stir up more faith.
00:05:21 The man he was to visit had severely persecuted
00:05:24 the holy ones in Jerusalem.
00:05:26 And speaking to the Lord, Ananias added
00:05:28 that this man “has authority from the chief priests
00:05:32 to arrest all those calling on your name.”
00:05:35 Well, talk about stating the obvious to Jesus.
00:05:40 The point is that Ananias had a moment
00:05:43 where he was overwhelmed by the weight of the assignment.
00:05:45 That’s just what happened.
00:05:47 What would help him? More faith.
00:05:49 And Jesus knew how to draw it up in that dear man.
00:05:53 Look again at Jesus’ reply.
00:05:54 He simply restated his command: “Go.”
00:05:58 Then Jesus said that “this man is a chosen vessel to me
00:06:02 “to bear my name to the nations
00:06:04 as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.”
00:06:08 Now, Jesus added something there, didn’t he?
00:06:12 He pointed to the future.
00:06:14 What was he doing?
00:06:15 He was helping Ananias to look ahead, see.
00:06:19 And doing this evidently prompted Ananias
00:06:22 to show even more faith, which is what he needed.
00:06:26 How do we know this?
00:06:27 Well, look at what he said to Saul.
00:06:29 On meeting Saul, verse 17 tells us
00:06:32 that Ananias called him “brother.”
00:06:35 His initial hesitation had changed
00:06:37 into putting his full faith and trust
00:06:40 in Jesus’ direction.
00:06:42 Well, like Ananias, as you face challenges in the future
00:06:46 (and they will come; they come upon all of us),
00:06:49 have strong faith that Jehovah sees what is needed,
00:06:53 and he and his dear Son will help you.
00:06:56 Keep the big picture in mind,
00:06:58 and look to the blessings ahead for your hard work.
00:07:02 Jehovah will always bless your strong faith in him.
00:07:07 Well, so far we’ve looked at the need to follow clear direction
00:07:10 and to show strong faith.
00:07:12 Now we’re going to add another step:
00:07:14 Use common sense, or thinking ability.
00:07:18 Our Bible example—Elijah.
00:07:21 In this account, Elijah has traveled to Zarephath,
00:07:24 a Phoenician coastal town.
00:07:27 What was his business there?
00:07:29 Well, the land was in the grip of a long drought,
00:07:32 and Jehovah would help his prophet
00:07:34 by means of someone in that town.
00:07:37 Elijah was told: “Look!
00:07:39 I will command a widow there to supply you with food.”
00:07:43 It appears that he gave no other details about the widow than that.
00:07:47 So how would Elijah find her?
00:07:50 Would Elijah look for the wealthiest widow to care for his needs?
00:07:54 Or would he use common sense and thinking ability along with his faith?
00:07:59 Let’s see what Elijah does at 1 Kings chapter 17.
00:08:04 And we’re going to read verse 10 —First Kings 17:10,
00:08:08 it says: “So he [Elijah] rose up and went to Zarephath.
00:08:12 “When he came to the entrance of the city,
00:08:15 “there was a widow gathering pieces of wood.
00:08:18 “So he called to her and said:
00:08:20 ‘Please, bring me a little water in a cup so that I may drink.’”
00:08:26 So then what did Elijah do?
00:08:29 Evidently, he approached the very first widow he met.
00:08:34 And she was not a wealthy widow, but a poor one.
00:08:37 In fact, it says Elijah had not yet passed
00:08:40 beyond the entrance of the city.
00:08:43 What does this tell us about Elijah?
00:08:46 First, he showed no prejudice
00:08:48 in following through on Jehovah’s direction, did he?
00:08:51 And second, he added thinking ability
00:08:55 to his obedience and faith.
00:08:57 How so?
00:08:59 Well, common sense would tell him to show his faith
00:09:02 and start looking with the very first widow he met.
00:09:06 Elijah obviously had confidence
00:09:09 that Jehovah would make his choice clear.
00:09:12 His obedience, faith, and good sense were rewarded
00:09:15 because that widow was Jehovah’s choice.
00:09:19 Now, surely holy spirit guided Elijah,
00:09:22 but we can’t ignore the faith and clear thinking ability
00:09:25 that Elijah developed as he obediently did God’s will.
00:09:30 After all, prior to that widow, Jehovah used birds
00:09:33 to carry food to his prophet.
00:09:36 Surely Jehovah could use a poor widow as well.
00:09:39 What’s the lesson for you and for all of us?
00:09:42 Sometimes we’re given much to go on
00:09:45 when we receive an assignment
00:09:47 and, at other times, frankly, maybe not so much.
00:09:51 In such a case, our faith and clear thinking ability
00:09:55 remind us to trust in Jehovah
00:09:58 and to look for his guidance as we go forward in doing his will.
00:10:03 Jehovah will always help you dear friends at the right time.
00:10:08 So then, as our examples show, promptly obey,
00:10:11 show strong faith, and use common sense and thinking ability
00:10:16 in our service to our dear heavenly Father.
00:10:19 Remembering such lessons will help you
00:10:22 as you support Jehovah’s work
00:10:24 in your respective branches.
00:10:27 Jehovah gives power beyond what is normal
00:10:30 to those who rely on him
00:10:33 and follow the steps that lead to blessings.
00:10:36 And we are confident that this will always be true of you.
