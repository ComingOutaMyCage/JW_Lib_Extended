00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:04.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin, I’d like to share
a personal experience with you.

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:10.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was told that I was appointed to be
a member of the Governing Body,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the brothers who informed me said:

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With this assignment, you’ll experience

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a great increase in responsibility.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But you’ll also see a corresponding increase

00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:25.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in Jehovah’s spirit to help you.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will not be too much for you.”

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:33.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those words were very,
very reassuring to me.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the fact is that all of us

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
(no matter who we are)
serving Jehovah faithfully

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
must rely on his help

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:45.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
to succeed in serving him.

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how do we show this
and receive his help?

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:50.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are a number of ways.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to focus on three of them.

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are these: Follow direction, show faith,

00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:00.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
and use common sense,
or the thinking ability,

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:02.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given to us.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s consider the first step.

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:10.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes all that’s required
to receive Jehovah’s blessing on our work

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to follow simple, clear direction.

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a Bible example of that.

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found in Mark chapter 14

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark chapter 14.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you’ll recall from this account

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:26.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s Son directed two of his disciples

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:30.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go into Jerusalem and to prepare a large,

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
furnished upper room for the Passover.

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:35.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
His directions were specific.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, Jesus said that they would meet

00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:42.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘a man carrying a large, earthenware jar,

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:44.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were to follow him.’

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:48.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then starting in verse 14,
Jesus added this,

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:53.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “Wherever he goes inside,
say to the master of the house,

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:55.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The Teacher says: “Where is the guest room

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:58.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where I may eat
the Passover with my disciples?”’

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he will show you a large upper room,
furnished and ready.

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Prepare it for us there.

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:07.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the disciples went out,
and they entered the city

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and found it just as he said to them,

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they prepared for the Passover.”

00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:17.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the directions were simple, right?

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:19.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were told where they should go,

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
who they should follow,
what they were to say,

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they were to do.

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:28.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the two disciples promptly followed
that direction,

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:32.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of course, their obedience
brought many blessings, as we know.

00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:37.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what practical lesson
can you draw from this?

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson: Sometimes all that is needed
in serving Jehovah

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:43.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to follow simple, clear direction.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:48.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll have many opportunities to do so
in your assignments.

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:52.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow clear direction,
and look for Jehovah’s blessing on it.

00:02:53.957 --> 00:02:56.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, on the other hand,
you might be asked to care for something

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:59.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s far more involved than that.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, what if you’re asked
to assist someone

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s known to be difficult to deal with?

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:11.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you’re asked
to care for a work-related problem

00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:14.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
that others have not been able to solve.

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:19.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re the one selected
because you’ve had the training.

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
In such a case, what will help you?

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your strong faith—the next step.

00:03:24.554 --> 00:03:28.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact is that at times we need to show
added faith to fulfill our assignments.

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
True?

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:31.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the example of Ananias.

00:03:31.594 --> 00:03:33.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he too was a man of faith,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he faced a challenge
that required even more of him,

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we read about it in Acts chapter 9.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:44.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll begin with verse 10
—Acts 9:10—

00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:48.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “There was a disciple
named Ananias in Damascus,

00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:51.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Lord said to him in a vision:
‘Ananias!’

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:53.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said: ‘Here I am, Lord.’

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:57.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Lord said to him:
‘Get up, go to the street called Straight,

00:03:57.787 --> 00:04:00.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and look for a man named Saul, from Tarsus,

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘at the house of Judas.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For look! he is praying,

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and in a vision he has seen
a man named Ananias

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:11.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“come in and lay his hands on him
so that he may recover sight.’

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Ananias answered: ‘Lord,

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:17.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have heard from many about this man,

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:22.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘about all the harm he did
to your holy ones in Jerusalem.

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:24.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And here he has authority
from the chief priests

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to arrest all those calling on your name.’

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the Lord said to him:
‘Go! because this man

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is a chosen vessel to me
to bear my name to the nations

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:38.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For I will show him plainly how many things

00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:43.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
he must suffer for my name.’”

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:46.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the direction was clear.

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where should Ananias go?
To the street called Straight.

00:04:50.473 --> 00:04:53.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was he looking for?
A man named Saul.

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:56.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
What house is he in?
The house of Judas.

00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:59.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ananias was even told what Saul was doing.

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was praying.

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Ananias was told what he should do.

00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:09.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was to lay his hands on him
so that he would recover sight.

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:11.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simple, right?

00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:13.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus would do the rest.

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great example
of giving clear direction!

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:21.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here is where Ananias
needed to stir up more faith.

00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:24.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man he was to visit
had severely persecuted

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
the holy ones in Jerusalem.

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:28.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
And speaking to the Lord, Ananias added

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:32.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this man
“has authority from the chief priests

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:35.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
to arrest all those calling on your name.”

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:39.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, talk about stating
the obvious to Jesus.

00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:43.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Ananias had a moment

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:45.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he was overwhelmed
by the weight of the assignment.

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:47.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s just what happened.

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:49.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would help him?
More faith.

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:53.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus knew how to draw it up
in that dear man.

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:54.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look again at Jesus’ reply.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:58.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
He simply restated his command: “Go.”

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:02.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jesus said that “this man
is a chosen vessel to me

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:04.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to bear my name to the nations

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:07.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.”

00:06:08.418 --> 00:06:11.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus added something there, didn’t he?

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
He pointed to the future.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was he doing?

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:19.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was helping Ananias to look ahead, see.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
And doing this evidently prompted Ananias

00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:26.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show even more faith,
which is what he needed.

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:27.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know this?

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, look at what he said to Saul.

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:32.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
On meeting Saul, verse 17 tells us

00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:35.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Ananias called him “brother.”

00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:37.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
His initial hesitation had changed

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
into putting his full faith and trust

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jesus’ direction.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:46.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, like Ananias,
as you face challenges in the future

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:49.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and they will come;
they come upon all of us),

00:06:49.592 --> 00:06:53.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
have strong faith
that Jehovah sees what is needed,

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he and his dear Son will help you.

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep the big picture in mind,

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:02.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look to the blessings ahead
for your hard work.

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:07.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will always bless
your strong faith in him.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, so far we’ve looked at the need
to follow clear direction

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:12.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to show strong faith.

00:07:12.548 --> 00:07:14.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re going to add another step:

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:18.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use common sense, or thinking ability.

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:21.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Bible example—Elijah.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this account,
Elijah has traveled to Zarephath,

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:27.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Phoenician coastal town.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:29.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was his business there?

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:32.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the land was
in the grip of a long drought,

00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:34.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah would help his prophet

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of someone in that town.

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:39.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah was told: “Look!

00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:43.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will command a widow there
to supply you with food.”

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:47.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
It appears that he gave no other details
about the widow than that.

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:50.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how would Elijah find her?

00:07:50.353 --> 00:07:54.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Elijah look for the wealthiest widow
to care for his needs?

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or would he use common sense
and thinking ability along with his faith?

00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:04.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what Elijah does
at 1 Kings chapter 17.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:08.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to read verse 10
—First Kings 17:10,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “So he [Elijah]
rose up and went to Zarephath.

00:08:12.808 --> 00:08:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he came to the entrance of the city,

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there was a widow gathering pieces of wood.

00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:20.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he called to her and said:

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Please, bring me a little water in a cup
so that I may drink.’”

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:29.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then what did Elijah do?

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:34.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, he approached
the very first widow he met.

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:37.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she was not a wealthy widow,
but a poor one.

00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:40.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it says Elijah had not yet passed

00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:43.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
beyond the entrance of the city.

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this tell us about Elijah?

00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:48.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he showed no prejudice

00:08:48.844 --> 00:08:51.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
in following through on Jehovah’s direction,
did he?

00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second, he added thinking ability

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his obedience and faith.

00:08:57.887 --> 00:08:59.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:02.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, common sense would tell him
to show his faith

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:06.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start looking
with the very first widow he met.

00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah obviously had confidence

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would make his choice clear.

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:15.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
His obedience, faith, and good sense
were rewarded

00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:19.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that widow was Jehovah’s choice.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:22.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, surely holy spirit guided Elijah,

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can’t ignore
the faith and clear thinking ability

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Elijah developed
as he obediently did God’s will.

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, prior to that widow,
Jehovah used birds

00:09:33.289 --> 00:09:36.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry food to his prophet.

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:39.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Surely Jehovah
could use a poor widow as well.

00:09:39.395 --> 00:09:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson for you and for all of us?

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:45.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we’re given much to go on

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we receive an assignment

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, at other times, frankly,
maybe not so much.

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:55.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
In such a case,
our faith and clear thinking ability

00:09:55.878 --> 00:09:58.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
remind us to trust in Jehovah

00:09:58.447 --> 00:10:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to look for his guidance
as we go forward in doing his will.

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:07.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will always help you dear friends
at the right time.

00:10:08.624 --> 00:10:11.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then, as our examples show, promptly obey,

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:16.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
show strong faith,
and use common sense and thinking ability

00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:19.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our service to our dear heavenly Father.

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:22.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remembering such lessons will help you

00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you support Jehovah’s work

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:27.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your respective branches.

00:10:27.243 --> 00:10:30.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives power beyond what is normal

00:10:30.646 --> 00:10:33.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who rely on him

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
and follow the steps that lead to blessings.

00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:40.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we are confident
that this will always be true of you.
