00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:04.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this day has arrived for you students.

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:08.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see you there smiling
and looking forward to this program.

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:13.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure it’s hard for you to believe
that we’ve actually gotten to graduation day.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also know that you’re very keen
and enthusiastic to get to your assignments,

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:21.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether you’re going back
to where you came from

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you’re going to a new assignment.

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:27.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the last few months,
you’ve learned so much, haven’t you?

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:31.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve crammed that information
into your mind and heart,

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now you have that ready to implement it

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:37.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you go to your assignments.

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:40.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need to be careful

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:44.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to be enthusiastic,
keen, and zealous,

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:47.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also we need to be patient.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’d like to talk to you
for a few moments about this theme

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:56.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Enthusiastic but Be Patient” as well.

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:57.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why so?

00:00:57.907 --> 00:01:02.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you go to your assignments
with all this that you’ve learned,

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to be tempted
to try and implement it everywhere.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember, you’re not going to change
the whole world in one day

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:13.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even the whole branch.

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:18.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,
it’s so easy to become overwhelmed

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:21.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we try to take on too much
all at one time.

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:25.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s why it’s important
to be enthusiastic

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also patient.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:33.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Lord Jesus Christ
was an excellent example of this.

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:35.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus came into the world,

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:38.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
the whole world needed to hear his message.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, he had to wait some 30 years,

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:46.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
growing up according to Jehovah’s timetable,
before he started his ministry.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that took patience on his part, didn’t it?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about when Jesus
started his ministry?

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:57.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was his focus?

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can imagine him looking around,

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:03.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing all the things that needed to be done
in the world at that point.

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:05.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s turn in our Bibles.

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:08.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to Matthew chapter 15

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:12.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 15:24,

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here Jesus said to his apostles:

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:19.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was not sent to anyone

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
except to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.”

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s interesting.

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:30.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus here mentions
he had a specific, limited assignment.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the assignment?

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:36.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
To go “to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.”

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you turn back
just a couple of chapters,

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
in chapter 10 of Matthew,

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:46.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll notice in verses 5 and 6
that when Jesus sent out his apostles,

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:48.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did he say to them?

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not go off into the road of the nations,

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:56.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not enter any Samaritan city;

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but instead, go continually

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as Jesus sent out his apostles

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:08.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this particular instance,

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:11.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was he reminding them of?

00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:12.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was telling them

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:16.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they likewise had a limited assignment,

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
a specific assignment.

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:19.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
They weren’t supposed to try

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do everything all at once

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to go to the Samaritans and to the Gentiles.

00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:25.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were to focus

00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:27.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
just on “the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:31.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we think about this,

00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do we learn from these two verses?

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:40.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, the whole world
needed to hear the message.

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:44.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jesus do,
and what did he expect of his apostles?

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:49.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
That they would recognize
that they had a specific assignment.

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
They weren’t to be overwhelmed

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:55.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
by trying to think of changing
the whole world at that point.

00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:58.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus showed great trust in Jehovah.

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:03.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that Jehovah
would gradually expand the message

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:05.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reach of the message.

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:09.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, we realize
that at Pentecost there was an expansion

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:12.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then in 36 C.E., another expansion.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does that mean for you?

00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:20.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, when you return to your assignment
or you go to the new one,

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s going to be
an endless number of possibilities

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you can help others

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to stabilize and strengthen everyone.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you try to take everything on at once,

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to wear yourself out

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
and probably wear out
a whole lot of other people as well.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:43.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know the English idiom
“Don’t bite off more than you can chew.”

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:47.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, gradually do the things
that Jehovah has assigned you to do.

00:04:47.904 --> 00:04:52.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you try to be too broad in what you do,

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:54.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may end up not accomplishing much at all

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:57.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
except just wearing yourself out.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
But be patient just as Jesus was,

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and recognize that each one of you
will have a specific assignment.

00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:06.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then try to work at that,

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:09.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting that Jehovah will allow

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:12.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
your good example to benefit others,

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:17.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gradually the effects of your work
will spread to others.

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:21.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, an example of this is
in the South Pacific,

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:23.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
if I could just tell you about that now.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
When missionaries arrived
in the South Pacific—

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take, for example,

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might end up in a country

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has 100 inhabited islands.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re a new missionary.

00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember the feeling.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then you find out
there are only ten islands

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have Jehovah’s Witnesses on them

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
—ten islands that have
publishers and congregations.

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:49.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there are 90 that don’t.

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:53.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you think
the normal enthusiastic response is?

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, let’s get a boat.
We have to get a boat!

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:58.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We must visit all the 90 islands.

00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:00.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, that needs to be done now, immediately!”

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:06.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, usually you’re assigned
to one congregation

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:07.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
in one area.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s the point?

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:11.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
What normally happens?

00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:13.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you see, if you were to get a boat

00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:15.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and there’s nothing wrong
with getting a boat

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:17.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
or visiting other islands)

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if that becomes your focus
and you neglect your assignment,

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:25.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can you follow up on all the interest
that you may find on those 90 islands?

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:28.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not just enough
to go and give them some magazines,

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:30.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you need to be there with them,

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:34.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
build them up,
and form congregations.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
So normally what happens?

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:40.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s amazing to see
missionaries and others

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:43.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
who work in maybe larger city areas;

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:47.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
they work diligently at their assignments.

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:50.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then maybe others from different islands

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
come to visit that city
the missionaries are in,

00:06:53.863 --> 00:06:55.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they get contacted.

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:57.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
They show an interest, they start to study,

00:06:57.733 --> 00:07:00.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they return to their home islands.

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:01.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what happens?

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gradually, the work spreads out
to all these islands.

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t feel
that you have to take on everything.

00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:15.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Focus as Jesus did
on the limited assignment you have.

00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:20.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then along the way,
you may be surprised at what happens.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s exactly what happened to Jesus.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:28.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to Matthew chapter 15.

00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,
what was the assignment that Jesus had?

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:34.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 24,

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:36.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
he mentioned “Israel.”

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, looking at this map, we see at that time

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:44.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was actually a border around that area

00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:47.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we could say was his territory assignment.

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:50.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Jesus said these words,

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
where was he?

00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:52.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember?

00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:55.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look in verse 21:

00:07:55.124 --> 00:07:57.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus now went into the region

00:07:57.693 --> 00:07:59.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Tyre and Sidon.”

00:08:00.429 --> 00:08:02.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you look at the map,

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:04.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
where was Tyre and Sidon?

00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you notice?

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:09.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, he wasn’t in his territory.

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:11.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was out among the Gentiles.

00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:13.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:16.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when we look at the parallel account

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:18.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s mentioned in Mark chapter 7,

00:08:18.814 --> 00:08:23.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
it tells us that Jesus wanted
some time alone with his apostles,

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:26.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
some downtime
because there were so many crowds;

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:27.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were so busy.

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’m sure all of us
can understand that feeling Jesus had.

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:34.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he took them out of that general area

00:08:34.363 --> 00:08:36.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this territory

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was beyond what he
would normally preach in

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have some quiet time together.

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:43.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happened?

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:47.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the account tells us
that there was a Syrophoenician woman,

00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:49.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps (as the study notes help us to see)

00:08:49.812 --> 00:08:51.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a Greek background

00:08:51.814 --> 00:08:53.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far as her nationality went,

00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:56.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maybe she was a citizen

00:08:56.219 --> 00:08:58.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an inhabitant of that area,

00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:00.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Syrophoenician area.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this woman approached Jesus,
pleading with him.

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:07.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, she didn’t look like a Jewish person.

00:09:07.063 --> 00:09:10.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
She probably didn’t even speak Hebrew.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
She certainly wasn’t in the category

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the lost ones of the house of Israel.

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:17.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus,

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
initially when she started
to make these efforts to talk to him,

00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:25.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned this to his apostles in verse 24:

00:09:25.047 --> 00:09:27.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘That’s our assignment.’

00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:30.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice that this was a little different

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the sense that this woman

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:36.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed an appreciation for who Jesus was.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in verse 22, she said:

00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David.”

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a Gentile woman.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should she really know who David was?

00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:52.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by saying “Son of David,”

00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:56.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the study note indicates,
perhaps she was showing faith

00:09:56.112 --> 00:10:00.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the fact that Jesus is the Messiah.

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:03.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she wasn’t
your average Syrophoenician person.

00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:05.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jesus do?

00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:07.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he tested her a little.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did emphasize
the fact that in a household

00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:15.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
you first of all
feed the children, the family,

00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:17.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the little dogs get fed afterward.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps he was playing on words there.

00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:21.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re not sure
what language Jesus was speaking to her. 

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  did say that Jesus

00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:29.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps did understand Greek
and use it at times.

00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:32.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, his apostles
obviously understood some Greek.

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:35.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wrote some of the books of the Bible
in Greek.

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever the case,
the record of this is written

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:41.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the inspired record—
in Greek,

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:44.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it uses this term “little dogs.”

00:10:45.127 --> 00:10:46.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was that offensive?

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:47.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:50.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it’s mentioned,
it was an affectionate term

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:53.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
like saying “puppies” or “pets.”

00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:55.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever the case,

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:59.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
he must have looked very friendly,
perhaps had a smile on his face,

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:01.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she was not deterred.

00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:04.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Jesus’ reaction?

00:11:04.113 --> 00:11:07.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he acknowledged
his territory, his assignment.

00:11:07.683 --> 00:11:10.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then in verse 28, he said,

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:12.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O woman, great is your faith;

00:11:12.788 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
let it happen to you as you wish.”

00:11:17.193 --> 00:11:20.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this the only time
that Jesus did something like this

00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:22.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a non-Jewish person?

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:25.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember in John chapter 4,

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:28.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only do we have this case
of the Syrophoenician woman,

00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:32.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in John chapter 4,
we’re told about the Samaritan woman.

00:11:32.708 --> 00:11:36.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
This non-Jewish person was witnessed to,

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:40.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then even members of her village

00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:43.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
accepted Jesus as the Messiah.

00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:46.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then what about the Roman army officer

00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:48.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus was able to help?

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus mentioned

00:11:50.092 --> 00:11:52.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he hadn’t even seen

00:11:52.194 --> 00:11:54.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
that type of faith in all of Israel.

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:59.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what lesson do we learn from this?

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:02.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus focused on his assignment.

00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:06.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always acknowledged
what he was assigned to do.

00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:10.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when opportunities came up along the way

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:14.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help those
who weren’t necessarily in his assignment,

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still gave them some help

00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:20.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they were genuine persons
who needed help.

00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:24.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, although Jesus realized
it wasn’t yet the time to expand the work,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was willing to reach out
to these ones as well.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:32.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the lesson for all of us?

00:12:32.768 --> 00:12:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you go to your assignments,
you will have specific assignments.

00:12:37.106 --> 00:12:40.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if it’s in a Bethel or in the field,

00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:43.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll know what your assignment is.

00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:46.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
So don’t start looking
at all the other assignments that are around

00:12:46.615 --> 00:12:48.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how you can help them
and what you need to do

00:12:48.918 --> 00:12:51.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say, “Oh, why don’t they change?”

00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:53.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, you’ve changed a lot
in the last few months;

00:12:53.989 --> 00:12:55.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
but remember, they haven’t.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:58.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they survived without you.

00:13:00.996 --> 00:13:03.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the key?

00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:07.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Focus on your assignment.

00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:09.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be zealous, be enthusiastic,

00:13:09.905 --> 00:13:12.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also be patient.

00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:15.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, have trust in Jehovah

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if you focus on your assignment,
you work hard,

00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:21.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
you take up whatever opportunities
come your way along the way,

00:13:21.984 --> 00:13:24.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you can be sure you will be blessed

00:13:24.453 --> 00:13:28.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you’re enthusiastic but also patient.
