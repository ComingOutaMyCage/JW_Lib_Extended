00:00:01 Well, this day has arrived for you students.
00:00:04 I see you there smiling and looking forward to this program.
00:00:08 I’m sure it’s hard for you to believe that we’ve actually gotten to graduation day.
00:00:14 But we also know that you’re very keen and enthusiastic to get to your assignments,
00:00:19 whether you’re going back to where you came from
00:00:21 or you’re going to a new assignment.
00:00:23 Over the last few months, you’ve learned so much, haven’t you?
00:00:27 You’ve crammed that information into your mind and heart,
00:00:31 and now you have that ready to implement it
00:00:35 when you go to your assignments.
00:00:38 But we need to be careful
00:00:40 not only to be enthusiastic, keen, and zealous,
00:00:44 but also we need to be patient.
00:00:47 So we’d like to talk to you for a few moments about this theme
00:00:51 “Be Enthusiastic but Be Patient” as well.
00:00:56 Why so?
00:00:57 Well, when you go to your assignments with all this that you’ve learned,
00:01:02 you’re going to be tempted to try and implement it everywhere.
00:01:07 But remember, you’re not going to change the whole world in one day
00:01:11 or even the whole branch.
00:01:13 You see, it’s so easy to become overwhelmed
00:01:18 if we try to take on too much all at one time.
00:01:21 So that’s why it’s important to be enthusiastic
00:01:25 but also patient.
00:01:29 Our Lord Jesus Christ was an excellent example of this.
00:01:33 When Jesus came into the world,
00:01:35 the whole world needed to hear his message.
00:01:38 And yet, he had to wait some 30 years,
00:01:42 growing up according to Jehovah’s timetable, before he started his ministry.
00:01:46 So that took patience on his part, didn’t it?
00:01:50 But what about when Jesus started his ministry?
00:01:54 What was his focus?
00:01:57 You can imagine him looking around,
00:01:59 seeing all the things that needed to be done in the world at that point.
00:02:03 But let’s turn in our Bibles.
00:02:05 If you turn with me, please, to Matthew chapter 15
00:02:08 —Matthew 15:24,
00:02:12 and here Jesus said to his apostles:
00:02:16 “I was not sent to anyone
00:02:19 except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:02:24 That’s interesting.
00:02:25 Jesus here mentions he had a specific, limited assignment.
00:02:30 What was the assignment?
00:02:32 To go “to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:02:36 Now, if you turn back just a couple of chapters,
00:02:39 in chapter 10 of Matthew,
00:02:41 you’ll notice in verses 5 and 6 that when Jesus sent out his apostles,
00:02:46 what did he say to them?
00:02:48 “Do not go off into the road of the nations,
00:02:52 “and do not enter any Samaritan city;
00:02:56 “but instead, go continually
00:02:59 to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:03:03 So as Jesus sent out his apostles
00:03:06 in this particular instance,
00:03:08 what was he reminding them of?
00:03:11 He was telling them
00:03:12 that they likewise had a limited assignment,
00:03:16 a specific assignment.
00:03:18 They weren’t supposed to try
00:03:19 and do everything all at once
00:03:21 —to go to the Samaritans and to the Gentiles.
00:03:23 They were to focus
00:03:25 just on “the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:03:28 So when we think about this,
00:03:31 what do we learn from these two verses?
00:03:34 Well, first of all,
00:03:36 yes, the whole world needed to hear the message.
00:03:40 But what did Jesus do, and what did he expect of his apostles?
00:03:44 That they would recognize that they had a specific assignment.
00:03:49 They weren’t to be overwhelmed
00:03:51 by trying to think of changing the whole world at that point.
00:03:55 Jesus showed great trust in Jehovah.
00:03:58 He knew that Jehovah would gradually expand the message
00:04:03 and the reach of the message.
00:04:05 And, of course, we realize that at Pentecost there was an expansion
00:04:09 and then in 36 C.E., another expansion.
00:04:13 So, what does that mean for you?
00:04:16 You see, when you return to your assignment or you go to the new one,
00:04:20 there’s going to be an endless number of possibilities
00:04:24 where you can help others
00:04:27 —to stabilize and strengthen everyone.
00:04:30 But if you try to take everything on at once,
00:04:33 you’re going to wear yourself out
00:04:34 and probably wear out a whole lot of other people as well.
00:04:38 You know the English idiom “Don’t bite off more than you can chew.”
00:04:43 You see, gradually do the things that Jehovah has assigned you to do.
00:04:47 If you try to be too broad in what you do,
00:04:52 you may end up not accomplishing much at all
00:04:54 except just wearing yourself out.
00:04:57 But be patient just as Jesus was,
00:04:59 and recognize that each one of you will have a specific assignment.
00:05:04 And then try to work at that,
00:05:06 trusting that Jehovah will allow
00:05:09 your good example to benefit others,
00:05:12 and gradually the effects of your work will spread to others.
00:05:17 Now, an example of this is in the South Pacific,
00:05:21 if I could just tell you about that now.
00:05:23 When missionaries arrived in the South Pacific—
00:05:26 Let’s take, for example,
00:05:28 you might end up in a country
00:05:30 that has 100 inhabited islands.
00:05:33 Now you’re a new missionary.
00:05:35 I remember the feeling.
00:05:37 And then you find out there are only ten islands
00:05:41 that have Jehovah’s Witnesses on them
00:05:43 —ten islands that have publishers and congregations.
00:05:47 So there are 90 that don’t.
00:05:49 So, what do you think the normal enthusiastic response is?
00:05:53 “Oh, let’s get a boat. We have to get a boat!
00:05:56 “We must visit all the 90 islands.
00:05:58 Oh, that needs to be done now, immediately!”
00:06:02 Well, usually you’re assigned to one congregation
00:06:06 in one area.
00:06:07 Now, what’s the point?
00:06:09 What normally happens?
00:06:11 Well, you see, if you were to get a boat
00:06:13 (and there’s nothing wrong with getting a boat
00:06:15 or visiting other islands)
00:06:17 and if that becomes your focus and you neglect your assignment,
00:06:20 how can you follow up on all the interest that you may find on those 90 islands?
00:06:25 It’s not just enough to go and give them some magazines,
00:06:28 but you need to be there with them,
00:06:30 build them up, and form congregations.
00:06:34 So normally what happens?
00:06:36 Well, it’s amazing to see missionaries and others
00:06:40 who work in maybe larger city areas;
00:06:43 they work diligently at their assignments.
00:06:47 But then maybe others from different islands
00:06:50 come to visit that city the missionaries are in,
00:06:53 and they get contacted.
00:06:55 They show an interest, they start to study,
00:06:57 and they return to their home islands.
00:07:00 And what happens?
00:07:01 Gradually, the work spreads out to all these islands.
00:07:05 So, what’s the point?
00:07:07 Don’t feel that you have to take on everything.
00:07:11 Focus as Jesus did on the limited assignment you have.
00:07:15 But then along the way, you may be surprised at what happens.
00:07:21 Now, that’s exactly what happened to Jesus.
00:07:24 Let’s go back to Matthew chapter 15.
00:07:28 Remember, what was the assignment that Jesus had?
00:07:32 In verse 24,
00:07:34 he mentioned “Israel.”
00:07:36 Now, looking at this map, we see at that time
00:07:40 there was actually a border around that area
00:07:44 that we could say was his territory assignment.
00:07:47 But when Jesus said these words,
00:07:50 where was he?
00:07:51 Do you remember?
00:07:52 Let’s look in verse 21:
00:07:55 “Jesus now went into the region
00:07:57 of Tyre and Sidon.”
00:08:00 So when you look at the map,
00:08:02 where was Tyre and Sidon?
00:08:05 What do you notice?
00:08:06 You see, he wasn’t in his territory.
00:08:09 He was out among the Gentiles.
00:08:12 Why?
00:08:13 Well, when we look at the parallel account
00:08:16 that’s mentioned in Mark chapter 7,
00:08:18 it tells us that Jesus wanted some time alone with his apostles,
00:08:23 some downtime because there were so many crowds;
00:08:26 they were so busy.
00:08:27 Now, I’m sure all of us can understand that feeling Jesus had.
00:08:31 So he took them out of that general area
00:08:34 to this territory
00:08:36 that was beyond what he would normally preach in
00:08:39 to have some quiet time together.
00:08:41 But what happened?
00:08:43 Well, the account tells us that there was a Syrophoenician woman,
00:08:47 perhaps (as the study notes help us to see)
00:08:49 from a Greek background
00:08:51 as far as her nationality went,
00:08:53 but maybe she was a citizen
00:08:56 or an inhabitant of that area,
00:08:58 the Syrophoenician area.
00:09:01 So this woman approached Jesus, pleading with him.
00:09:04 Now, she didn’t look like a Jewish person.
00:09:07 She probably didn’t even speak Hebrew.
00:09:10 She certainly wasn’t in the category
00:09:13 of the lost ones of the house of Israel.
00:09:16 So Jesus,
00:09:17 initially when she started to make these efforts to talk to him,
00:09:21 mentioned this to his apostles in verse 24:
00:09:25 ‘That’s our assignment.’
00:09:27 But notice that this was a little different
00:09:30 in the sense that this woman
00:09:33 showed an appreciation for who Jesus was.
00:09:36 Notice in verse 22, she said:
00:09:39 “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David.”
00:09:44 Now, here’s a Gentile woman.
00:09:47 Should she really know who David was?
00:09:49 And by saying “Son of David,”
00:09:52 as the study note indicates, perhaps she was showing faith
00:09:56 in the fact that Jesus is the Messiah.
00:10:00 So she wasn’t your average Syrophoenician person.
00:10:04 What did Jesus do?
00:10:05 Well, he tested her a little.
00:10:07 He did emphasize the fact that in a household
00:10:11 you first of all feed the children, the family,
00:10:15 and then the little dogs get fed afterward.
00:10:17 And perhaps he was playing on words there.
00:10:20 It’s interesting.
00:10:21 We’re not sure what language Jesus was speaking to her.
00:10:24 The Watchtower  did say that Jesus
00:10:26 perhaps did understand Greek and use it at times.
00:10:29 Why, his apostles obviously understood some Greek.
00:10:32 They wrote some of the books of the Bible in Greek.
00:10:35 But whatever the case, the record of this is written
00:10:39 —the inspired record— in Greek,
00:10:41 and it uses this term “little dogs.”
00:10:45 Was that offensive?
00:10:46 No.
00:10:47 As it’s mentioned, it was an affectionate term
00:10:50 like saying “puppies” or “pets.”
00:10:53 So whatever the case,
00:10:55 he must have looked very friendly, perhaps had a smile on his face,
00:10:59 because she was not deterred.
00:11:01 What was Jesus’ reaction?
00:11:04 Well, he acknowledged his territory, his assignment.
00:11:07 But then in verse 28, he said,
00:11:10 “O woman, great is your faith;
00:11:12 let it happen to you as you wish.”
00:11:17 Is this the only time that Jesus did something like this
00:11:20 for a non-Jewish person?
00:11:22 Remember in John chapter 4,
00:11:25 not only do we have this case of the Syrophoenician woman,
00:11:28 but in John chapter 4, we’re told about the Samaritan woman.
00:11:32 This non-Jewish person was witnessed to,
00:11:36 and then even members of her village
00:11:40 accepted Jesus as the Messiah.
00:11:43 And then what about the Roman army officer
00:11:46 that Jesus was able to help?
00:11:48 And Jesus mentioned
00:11:50 that he hadn’t even seen
00:11:52 that type of faith in all of Israel.
00:11:55 So, what lesson do we learn from this?
00:11:59 Well, Jesus focused on his assignment.
00:12:02 He always acknowledged what he was assigned to do.
00:12:06 But when opportunities came up along the way
00:12:10 to help those who weren’t necessarily in his assignment,
00:12:14 he still gave them some help
00:12:16 because they were genuine persons who needed help.
00:12:20 Yes, although Jesus realized it wasn’t yet the time to expand the work,
00:12:24 he was willing to reach out to these ones as well.
00:12:29 So, what’s the lesson for all of us?
00:12:32 Well, when you go to your assignments, you will have specific assignments.
00:12:37 Now, if it’s in a Bethel or in the field,
00:12:40 you’ll know what your assignment is.
00:12:43 So don’t start looking at all the other assignments that are around
00:12:46 and how you can help them and what you need to do
00:12:48 and say, “Oh, why don’t they change?”
00:12:51 I mean, you’ve changed a lot in the last few months;
00:12:53 but remember, they haven’t.
00:12:56 And they survived without you.
00:13:00 So, what’s the key?
00:13:03 Focus on your assignment.
00:13:07 Be zealous, be enthusiastic,
00:13:09 but also be patient.
00:13:12 Yes, have trust in Jehovah
00:13:15 that if you focus on your assignment, you work hard,
00:13:18 you take up whatever opportunities come your way along the way,
00:13:21 then you can be sure you will be blessed
00:13:24 because you’re enthusiastic but also patient.
