00:00:01 In recent years, we’ve enjoyed watching The Inside Story,
00:00:06 and it really has helped us to get to know some of the students a little better
00:00:10 and to get “the inside story.”
00:00:13 So let’s enjoy this presentation of The Inside Story
00:00:17 as presented by one of the other lecturers,
00:00:20 or the instructors, in Gilead, Brother Richard Chilton.
00:00:25 All of us have a story.
00:00:28 But how is that story written?
00:00:31 A literal book contains a beginning, a middle, and an end.
00:00:36 And by the time we hold that book in our hand,
00:00:39 each chapter has been carefully analyzed and locked-in.
00:00:43 That story is done, finished.
00:00:48 Well, what about us?
00:00:50 Do you ever feel that your story
00:00:52 is pretty much locked-in, finished?
00:00:56 that the opportunity to make changes
00:00:58 in connection with your service to Jehovah has passed you by?
00:01:03 If so, please pay special attention
00:01:07 to what our guests have to share with us today
00:01:09 on this edition of The Inside Story.
00:01:40 The first couple we would like to introduce
00:01:42 is Tomáš and Eva Maruška from Slovakia.
00:01:57 Well, Tomáš and Eva, it is so nice to have you with us
00:02:01 on this edition of The Inside Story.
00:02:03 Welcome!
00:02:04 Thank you very much.
00:02:05 Now, we understand that you both grew up in a country that was under ban.
00:02:10 Can you tell us a little bit about that?
00:02:12 We remember growing up when the group was under ban,
00:02:16 and a change came later in 1989, at the end of the year.
00:02:20 And then finally in 1993,
00:02:22 the work was officially registered as Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:25 During a ban,
00:02:27 all the things are very different from what we know today.
00:02:29 For example, there are no assemblies
00:02:31 and no conventions at all held publicly like today.
00:02:34 Of course, no Kingdom Halls were available at that time.
00:02:37 So how did you hold your meetings
00:02:39 if there were no assemblies and no Kingdom Halls?
00:02:42 So I remember
00:02:43 that they were held in small groups in the private homes of our brothers,
00:02:47 and usually they were held very late in the evening.
00:02:50 So as children,
00:02:52 we really struggled to stay awake
00:02:54 and not to fall asleep during a meeting.
00:02:57 Under those circumstances,
00:02:59 how did you handle the matter of literature?
00:03:02 So there were no officially printed
00:03:04 and imported publications from our organization.
00:03:08 It was forbidden under ban.
00:03:11 However, we had homemade publications.
00:03:13 I remember growing up with the book My Book of Bible Stories.
00:03:16 It was a transcript of the stories but with no pictures.
00:03:21 So we had to really use our imagination and just imagine all those stories.
00:03:25 That was also in our family.
00:03:27 Tell us a little bit about your side of that story too.
00:03:30 Yeah, it’s very similar, I think.
00:03:32 My parents were involved in literature production.
00:03:36 It was either by typing or by photography.
00:03:39 Now, when you were both children and growing up under this environment,
00:03:43 were you allowed into these rooms where this printing was taking place?
00:03:47 So we were very curious as kids.
00:03:49 And, of course, we still tried to figure out what was inside.
00:03:53 We called it the secret room because all the secrets were kept there,
00:03:57 and there was this equipment
00:03:59 for making copies of literature.
00:04:02 A simple camera took a photo, and then with a magnifier,
00:04:05 they could make a different size of the publication—smaller.
00:04:09 It was easier for the friends to carry to meetings
00:04:12 and also easier to hide, of course.
00:04:14 Now, Eva, it went beyond
00:04:16 this secret room in the attic in your house.
00:04:20 There was another method
00:04:22 that your parents used in connection with this literature.
00:04:24 Can you tell us about that?
00:04:26 Yeah, actually, this literature needed to be transported somehow
00:04:29 to the groups that were using the publications or to the families.
00:04:34 So my parents did it in a way
00:04:36 where they put the publications in the back seat of the car,
00:04:39 behind the back seat of the car.
00:04:41 Now, did you and your siblings know this literature was in the car?
00:04:44 No, we had no idea.
00:04:46 You didn’t know.
00:04:46 They couldn’t tell us.
00:04:49 And there was also a way where they put it under our feet.
00:04:52 And actually, we are six kids, and I am the youngest,
00:04:55 so they put like four or five
00:04:56 or six of us in the back seat of the car.
00:04:58 We were sitting there patiently
00:05:01 and, you know, those cute little faces don’t look like smugglers.
00:05:05 Well, it’s obvious your parents
00:05:07 were thinking it through to protect everyone and to keep the work going.
00:05:11 That must have been very interesting, growing up under those circumstances.
00:05:15 Let’s move now into your teen years
00:05:18 and your early adult life.
00:05:21 What were some of the circumstances
00:05:24 that you had observed that affected your view, or attitude,
00:05:28 toward regular pioneering and just the full-time service in general?
00:05:33 So when I was growing up, we had no regular pioneers at all
00:05:36 in our congregation and just very few in our area.
00:05:39 Was there any particular reason why
00:05:42 there were so few pioneers in your area?
00:05:46 I would say that it took time to introduce and to understand the concept of pioneering.
00:05:52 Sometimes other spiritual goals were considered as more important
00:05:56 because during a ban, nobody was really preaching publicly.
00:06:00 So it took time to understand this concept
00:06:03 and to really have pioneers in the congregation.
00:06:06 And I remember that the first one whom I really met
00:06:09 and had the chance to work with was when I was 16.
00:06:11 At the time,
00:06:13 three special pioneers were assigned to our congregation:
00:06:15 one couple and one single brother.
00:06:17 And that single brother was accommodated in our home.
00:06:21 So for us, as two boys, it was really
00:06:23 like having an older brother at home,
00:06:26 a spiritual single brother pioneering.
00:06:28 So we could really see our first pioneer in flesh and blood
00:06:31 (to see him alive), and we could observe his goals.
00:06:35 And he spent a lot of time with us.
00:06:37 So about how old were you then, Tomáš,
00:06:40 when you started regular pioneering yourself?
00:06:43 So it was three years later.
00:06:45 It was when I was 19.
00:06:46 I was the first one in our congregation.
00:06:49 I tried, but at the time, there was still very little support.
00:06:53 We had just four regular pioneers in the whole circuit.
00:06:56 So then after several months,
00:06:59 I was struggling with the quota and several challenges came.
00:07:01 So I decided to quit pioneering
00:07:03 because I came to the conclusion
00:07:05 that it’s not really for me, so it’s probably for others.
00:07:09 What about in your case, Eva?
00:07:11 Actually, I never—
00:07:13 Growing up, I never had really any idea what pioneering meant.
00:07:16 So I didn’t have a real need
00:07:18 to start pioneering.
00:07:20 The first time I started pioneering was when we were already married,
00:07:24 and I set a goal to do it for one year.
00:07:27 But then also I stopped after one year.
00:07:30 OK, now you’re in your adult life here.
00:07:33 What came next?
00:07:35 So I would say that this was a turning point in our country
00:07:37 —when we got several couples as missionaries.
00:07:41 And they really brought zeal, the pioneer spirit from congregations
00:07:45 where they were pioneering for decades.
00:07:47 And this had a really nice influence on the congregations
00:07:50 and also the circuits.
00:07:52 You had mentioned, Eva, that when the missionaries came,
00:07:55 you mentioned a specific effect they had on the rest of you.
00:08:00 You want to tell us about that?
00:08:01 Well, I think it was huge.
00:08:02 They just woke us up.
00:08:04 They showed us what pioneering means
00:08:08 —that you can really enjoy the ministry.
00:08:10 Yeah, we remember their enthusiasm for the ministry.
00:08:13 And it was really catchy to hear these missionaries,
00:08:15 and they were struggling with the language.
00:08:17 So they were just learning Slovak —speaking broken Slovak.
00:08:19 But they identified young couples and really invested their time and energy.
00:08:24 They gave us a lot of their free time, not just during the ministry.
00:08:29 We made great friendships with them,
00:08:31 and until today, we have great relationships with them.
00:08:35 And you had mentioned when you were out in the ministry with them,
00:08:38 what was something that they showed you
00:08:41 was OK that added to your joy?
00:08:42 Well, this is a very important thing.
00:08:43 They showed us that we can drink coffee during the ministry
00:08:46 —yeah, good Italian coffee.
00:08:49 Oh, good.
00:08:50 They made it fun for you.
00:08:51 So where did that lead to?
00:08:53 So then later when we moved to another congregation
00:08:57 and with the nice spirit and support of the missionaries,
00:09:01 we decided to start as a couple pioneering.
00:09:03 I was around 28 or 29 at this time,
00:09:06 and we decided to start in the new service year.
00:09:09 We really saw and really understood what it means
00:09:12 that pioneers produce other pioneers
00:09:14 because within two years, we had 25 or 26 regular pioneers.
00:09:18 That’s amazing!
00:09:19 And they were supporting, really, every day the field service meetings.
00:09:22 You never— Sorry.
00:09:24 You were never searching for service partners.
00:09:27 Anytime you wanted to go in the ministry, you had a person to go with.
00:09:30 And Jehovah blessed it because after a while, we had a couple of Bible studies.
00:09:35 We were afraid, but after we started, it was a nice result
00:09:38 that Jehovah blessed pioneers in our congregation.
00:09:40 Then what was the next change for you after you started pioneering?
00:09:44 What came next?
00:09:45 Well, I felt that some change needed to be done
00:09:48 because I was a little tired of everything.
00:09:51 I was working eight hours a day secularly.
00:09:55 It was full-time work.
00:09:56 It was an international company
00:09:58 where everybody was just concerned about their career growth
00:10:01 and everything was about the efficiency in the work.
00:10:04 I was a little afraid to even go—
00:10:06 Nobody ever asked about reducing their working hours.
00:10:08 It was like, like the more you worked, it’s better.
00:10:12 So we started to pray about it, and finally I went and they granted me
00:10:16 that I could work from eight o’clock in the morning to noon.
00:10:19 But the amazing thing was that they gave me almost the same salary
00:10:24 as I had for eight hours,
00:10:26 like, for full-time work.
00:10:28 So your salary basically doubled while doing half the work, right?
00:10:31 Exactly.
00:10:32 How did you take advantage of that?
00:10:34 Well, at the time, the RTO was open.
00:10:36 Yeah, and I was helping with the construction of that RTO in our Kingdom Hall,
00:10:41 and I started to commute for the RTO to take care of some technical stuff.
00:10:45 And you were helping us at the RTO as a commuter.
00:10:48 Yes, I was working with food service
00:10:52 and with lunch,
00:10:54 but I needed to be there at lunchtime.
00:10:57 So I needed to go back to my employer
00:10:59 and ask to move my work time
00:11:04  to early morning hours.
00:11:05 So I would wake up at 4:30 a.m. and work until 10:00 a.m.
00:11:10 Actually, when they also granted this thing to me,
00:11:13 we saw that it was Jehovah behind it
00:11:15 because it was nothing normal in this environment.
00:11:20 So now with that change, you were able to fully support the assignment at the RTO.
00:11:24 Yeah, I could commute.
00:11:26 Where did that lead to next?
00:11:28 We were very happy at the time because we were pioneering.
00:11:31 We were doing a little bit of pioneering
00:11:32 and a little bit of Bethel because of the RTO,
00:11:35 and we felt that we were doing a lot
00:11:37 because we had to work and were supporting where we could.
00:11:41 But then we decided to apply for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
00:11:45 and we submitted our application.
00:11:47 There was a convention, and a couple from Bethel came,
00:11:50 and the brother asked us one question.
00:11:53 We still remember that question:
00:11:54 “Are you willing to serve anywhere?”
00:11:57 And we were like, “Yes, of course we are willing.”
00:11:59 And he asked us, “What about Bethel service?”
00:12:02 Well, we never thought about Bethel.
00:12:04 It was quite surprising for us.
00:12:06 But then we thought about this encouragement,
00:12:11 we prayed about it, and we decided to submit our applications for Bethel.
00:12:15 And surprisingly, within several months,
00:12:17 we were invited to serve at Bethel.
00:12:20 And so approximately what were your ages
00:12:22 around this time when you’re finally now entering Bethel service?
00:12:26 I was 31 or 32.
00:12:28 OK.
00:12:29 And she was younger.
00:12:30 OK, she was younger. We’ll leave it at that.
00:12:32 Real good.
00:12:33 So when you look back
00:12:36 on your life now,
00:12:38 how do you feel about the adjustments
00:12:41 that you made in your service to Jehovah?
00:12:43 We never regretted any of those decisions,
00:12:47 setting spiritual goals
00:12:48 —start pioneering, support the RTO, or apply for Bethel service.
00:12:52 Maybe there’s one change we would make.
00:12:54 What is that?
00:12:55 We would start earlier if we could.
00:12:57 Definitely.
00:12:58 Well, there are probably a number of us that would feel similarly.
00:13:01 But we’re glad that you did make those adjustments,
00:13:04 and it’s obvious that Jehovah has blessed you for doing so.
00:13:07 Thank you so much for taking time
00:13:09 to share your wonderful story with us.
00:13:12 It really touched our hearts, and we appreciate that.
00:13:14 Our pleasure. Thank you.
00:13:22 Next, we’ll enjoy the company
00:13:25 of José and Andreina Peláez.
00:13:40 Welcome to The Inside Story for Gilead class 152.
00:13:45 Did you think you would ever hear those words in your lifetime?
00:13:49 No. No, never.
00:13:51 In fact, being at Gilead
00:13:53 is the surprise of our lives.
00:13:56 Yes, it is definitely a surprise we never thought of.
00:13:59 Well, we are certainly happy to have you with us.
00:14:03 So you came to Gilead from Peru Bethel.
00:14:07 But before that, your home was Montreal, Canada.
00:14:11 How did that happen?
00:14:13 So I was born in Caracas, in Venezuela,
00:14:16 and that’s where I learned the truth.
00:14:19 When I was born,
00:14:20 my grandmother was a Witness, so she taught me the truth.
00:14:23 Eventually, my mother got baptized,
00:14:26 so she continued raising me in the truth.
00:14:28 And when I was ten years old,
00:14:30 my family decided to move, to immigrate, to Montreal, Canada.
00:14:35 So we arrived there
00:14:36 —it was my mother, my brother, and my unbelieving stepfather.
00:14:39 OK, so you go from Caracas, Venezuela,
00:14:42 to Montreal, Canada, at ten years of age.
00:14:46 How did you wind up in Montreal, José?
00:14:48 I was born in Lima, Peru,
00:14:51 and I heard about Jehovah when I was a child.
00:14:53 The Witnesses would come to my house,
00:14:55 and some of my older brothers even studied the Bible.
00:14:58 Then when I was a teenager,
00:15:00 because of the political and economic situation of the country,
00:15:03 my parents decided
00:15:04 to move to Canada, to Montreal, Canada.
00:15:06 My older brother was already living in Canada, and he was already a Witness.
00:15:11 But suddenly, sadly, soon after we arrived
00:15:14 —a few months after— my father died.
00:15:16 I’m sorry to hear that.
00:15:17 Thank you. Thank you.
00:15:18 So my mom and I stayed with my brother, and at that time,
00:15:23 the congregation helped us a lot to progress and get baptized.
00:15:26 So I made it a goal to share my relationship with Jehovah.
00:15:30 Then at the right moment of my life,
00:15:33 I met Andreina and eventually we got married.
00:15:36 What happens next with you two now that you’re married?
00:15:39 So when we got married,
00:15:40 we were not regular pioneers, but we had spoken about it.
00:15:44 We definitely wanted to make ourselves available.
00:15:47 What were you doing then if you weren’t regular pioneering at that point?
00:15:51 We both had our full-time jobs, and we were,
00:15:55 I mean, we were comfortable
00:15:57 and enjoyed both of our jobs—secular jobs.
00:16:01 So the idea of regular pioneering was there, like I said.
00:16:04 It was a goal that I previously had,
00:16:07 but, you know, we had a long way to go.
00:16:09 Now, you had mentioned to me earlier
00:16:11 that you were about 16 years old or so
00:16:14 when you first had this goal to pioneer.
00:16:16 Yes.
00:16:16 From 16 to what point do you finally now reach
00:16:20 entering the pioneer service?
00:16:22 Yes, so we started—
00:16:24 I was in my late 20’s when we started.
00:16:27 I was in my mid-30’s when I started.
00:16:29 We wanted to— Like we said before,
00:16:31 we wanted to increase our service to Jehovah,
00:16:34 but there were different challenges there and different adjustments we wanted to make.
00:16:38 And a turning point happened at that time
00:16:41 when we wanted to expand our ministry (service)
00:16:44 to be more useful in the hands of Jehovah.
00:16:47 The circuit overseer at that time
00:16:50 was Brother John Pappino and his wife, Sister Carla Pappino,
00:16:53 and they encouraged us very much to take on regular pioneering.
00:16:57 Yes, I remember being with them
00:16:59 out in the ministry during the week when they would come to the congregation,
00:17:03 and we’d always make a stop and go for coffee.
00:17:06 And we would enjoy their experiences
00:17:08 and just that happiness that we would see in them.
00:17:12 After each visit,
00:17:13 for family worship, we would discuss and see
00:17:16 how we could then simplify our lives.
00:17:19 Because that was it
00:17:20 —we needed to simplify our lives.
00:17:22 And we started by, you know, regularly auxiliary pioneering.
00:17:26 And we became—
00:17:28 Then eventually, we started this new chapter of our lives:
00:17:32 We became regular pioneers.
00:17:34 Now you’re in your early to mid-30’s; you’re in your late 20’s;
00:17:38 and now with that encouragement, you’re entering the pioneer service.
00:17:41 That’s good.
00:17:43 So did pioneering—?
00:17:45 Once you started pioneering, is that what now stirred your desire
00:17:48 to want to serve where the need was greater?
00:17:50 Oh no, not at all.
00:17:53 I mean, we always thought that serving in another country
00:17:58 or where the need is greater even in the country we were in
00:18:01 was maybe an experience from the Yearbook,
00:18:04 but not for us.
00:18:06 And we thought that we just had waited too long probably
00:18:08 to make those types of decisions.
00:18:10 So it was not something
00:18:11 that we thought we could do.
00:18:14 Correct, that’s it.
00:18:15 Many times we thought that we had waited too long
00:18:19 to start regular pioneering.
00:18:21 So the idea of serving in another country
00:18:25 never came to our mind.
00:18:26 However, another turning point in our life
00:18:29 was the encouragement of Brother John Pappino and his wife.
00:18:34 Now, you had mentioned to me earlier
00:18:36 that Brother Pappino gave you an illustration . . .
00:18:40 Yes.
00:18:42 . . . that really got you thinking.
00:18:44 What was that?
00:18:44 Yes.
00:18:46 When we were deciding to move,
00:18:49 there were always fears
00:18:51 (certain fears),
00:18:54 despite the fact that we had kind of made the decision to go.
00:18:58 So I mentioned this to Brother Pappino —about the fears we had.
00:19:03 So he gave me an illustration.
00:19:04 He told me:
00:19:06 “Imagine there’s a father, and in front of him is a table.
00:19:11 “And on top of the table is his child —his baby child of two years old.
00:19:16 And then all of a sudden, imagine that the child jumps to the floor.”
00:19:20 And he asked me,
00:19:22 “What do you think the father is going to do?”
00:19:24 And I said, “Well, he’s going to right away try to grab his baby
00:19:28 to help him to avoid hitting his face on the floor.”
00:19:30 And he told me,
00:19:31 “Well, that’s exactly what Jehovah is going to do if you jump to Peru,
00:19:34 if you step over to Peru.”
00:19:37 So that was beautiful.
00:19:39 And that gave us the strength, you can say,
00:19:42 to achieve
00:19:44 and make our decision to move to Peru.
00:19:48 So, what an illustration to get your minds and hearts thinking on it!
00:19:52 Yeah.
00:19:53 Like he said, there were many fears.
00:19:55 And also we had our lives in Canada, our families.
00:19:58 We had never been away from our families,
00:20:01 but the encouragement we received definitely made a good impression.
00:20:05 And then we prayed about it.
00:20:07 And yes, we thought that it was possible for us.
00:20:11 But it was not easy.
00:20:12 We still needed to make certain adjustments.
00:20:17 So Brother Pappino
00:20:19 was always encouraging us.
00:20:21 Yes, he said: “Just try it for one year or two, just to try it.
00:20:25 “If something doesn’t work, then you can always come back.
00:20:29 But you can taste what it is.”
00:20:32 What difference did that make for you —for him to give you that encouragement
00:20:35 to just put it in the context of just a year or two?
00:20:39 Did that affect your decision at all?
00:20:41 In a way, yes because, you know,
00:20:43  the idea of moving was a big change.
00:20:47 It was a big decision for us.
00:20:49 And having in mind that we could go for one year
00:20:52 —try it out and then come back—
00:20:54 kind of smoothed the fears, you know.
00:20:59 So that was a good example for us.
00:21:01 And we made the decision to move.
00:21:05 We made certain adjustments in our life,
00:21:07 in our secular work.
00:21:09 We sold our belongings, and we set a date.
00:21:13 We had a date.
00:21:14 We said, “By the end of this year
00:21:16 (that was in 2012) we need to go to Peru.”
00:21:19 Yeah.
00:21:20 So you got down there, and where did you go once you arrived there?
00:21:23 We arrived in Lima, and just a few weeks after,
00:21:27 we moved to Tacna.
00:21:29 This is a city in the south of Peru, bordering with Chile.
00:21:33 We took a bus from Lima to Tacna.
00:21:36 That was 22 hours of travel —a trip of 22 hours.
00:21:41 So the south of Peru is desert.
00:21:43 So you could imagine that after five hours, six hours, seven hours, ten hours,
00:21:47 all I saw on my left was sand, on my right was sand,
00:21:50 in the back was sand, and in the front was sand.
00:21:52 So I said to Andreina, “Where are we going?”
00:21:54 We had no idea it was like that at all.
00:21:59 But eventually, after 22 hours,
00:22:00 we could see the city.
00:22:02 We arrived, and yes, we were not going to live just on sand.
00:22:06 There was actually a city there.
00:22:08 And that was going to be our new home.
00:22:10 It started at the beginning, since the first day,
00:22:12 that Jehovah was proving to us that he was going to be there with us.
00:22:16 And then another door opened for us, and that was
00:22:20 to apply for the Bible School for Christian Couples back then.
00:22:25 So when that door opened,
00:22:27 we knew that the idea of just one year or two in Peru
00:22:32 was going to change.
00:22:34 And that’s what happened.
00:22:35 We attended school
00:22:38 one and a half years after we arrived in Tacna.
00:22:40 That’s when we were invited.
00:22:42 And then we had received an assignment.
00:22:45 Yes, they gave us the assignment
00:22:47 to serve as temporary special pioneers in Abancay,
00:22:51 which is in the Andes area of Peru.
00:22:54 So you went from the desert to the mountains?
00:22:56 Yes.
00:22:58 So how long were you there in your special pioneer assignment?
00:23:01 It was in total maybe five months.
00:23:04 Yes.
00:23:04 Why so short?
00:23:06 The branch office called us again,
00:23:07 telling us that now we were going to receive another assignment
00:23:12 to work in the circuit work —serve in the circuit work—
00:23:13 but the circuit work was going to be in Lima.
00:23:17 So you still had yet another course adjustment ahead of you.
00:23:21 How long were you there in the circuit work in Lima?
00:23:25 So after two years of serving in that circuit,
00:23:30 the branch office called me
00:23:32 and the brother told me
00:23:35 that they wanted to see us at the branch the next Monday.
00:23:40 So we said: “Fine, we can go there.
00:23:42 We can be there next Monday at 8:00 a.m.”
00:23:44 And he said, “Just make sure to bring your things to stay two weeks with us.”
00:23:49 Two weeks?
00:23:51 What was going through your mind when they told you that?
00:23:53 We actually had no idea.
00:23:55 They told us it’s training.
00:23:57 Training.
00:23:58 So we went for two weeks.
00:23:59 Yes.
00:24:00 And then
00:24:01 at the end of the two weeks, they told us that they extended us
00:24:04 for up to a month.
00:24:06 After one month, they extended us two months.
00:24:09 After two months, they extended us six months.
00:24:12 And then when all this happened,
00:24:13 I said, “Wait a minute
00:24:15 “—two weeks, one month, two months, six months—
00:24:20 am I entering Bethel in my mid-40’s?”
00:24:23 Yes.
00:24:24 So it was surprising for us.
00:24:25 Yes, and after six months—
00:24:27 Maybe Andreina can say this.
00:24:28 Yes, after six months, we received a letter that
00:24:32 that was our new assignment, and we could not believe it.
00:24:37 I mean, like he said, we had passed that age or reached that age
00:24:41 when normally you don’t start serving at Bethel.
00:24:44 And so how long have you been there in the Bethel in Peru?
00:24:47 It’s been six years.
00:24:48 Six years.
00:24:49 Yes.
00:24:50 So how many years, then, has it been since you left Montreal?
00:24:54 Almost ten years.
00:24:55 Almost ten.
00:24:56 Do you think Brother Pappino knew what he was doing
00:24:58 when he told you to just try it
00:25:00 for a year or two?
00:25:02 He definitely knew the blessings
00:25:03 that we were going to enjoy in Peru.
00:25:07 And I think the best counsel that he gave us
00:25:11 was to just give it a try for one year and see how it goes;
00:25:14 it was the best.
00:25:16 And a whole decade has passed since then.
00:25:18 When you look back over those
00:25:22 life course adjustments, how do you feel about the decisions you’ve made?
00:25:27 Well, we don’t regret any of these decisions.
00:25:30 We just feel so grateful because from the beginning,
00:25:35 both of our families supported us.
00:25:37 Also the examples of brothers like that couple,
00:25:41 John and Carla Pappino, everything—
00:25:44 We’ve seen how Jehovah has guided us,
00:25:46 how he has given us blessings
00:25:50 that we never saw coming
00:25:53 —all these new chapters that we have added into our lives.
00:25:57 We are very happy for that.
00:25:59 Yes, we’re very grateful
00:26:01 to all those brothers and sisters who helped us along the way.
00:26:06 And like my wife said,
00:26:09 we don’t regret it at all.
00:26:11 We couldn’t do it before,
00:26:13 but Jehovah knew
00:26:16 the specific time.
00:26:17 And looking back,
00:26:20 we can only express our deep appreciation
00:26:24 and joy for Jehovah’s blessings.
00:26:28 All praise goes to Jehovah,
00:26:31 and we are totally convinced
00:26:33 that it’s never too late to reach out in Jehovah’s service.
00:26:38 Well, we are so proud of you both for making those course adjustments.
00:26:42 And it’s clear that Jehovah has been with you
00:26:45 and blessing you along the way.
00:26:47 Thank you so much for sharing your encouraging story with us,
00:26:52 and we pray for Jehovah’s rich blessing on you
00:26:54 as you continue on in your faithful service.
00:26:57 Thank you for joining us today.
00:26:58 Thank you.
00:26:59 Thank you.
00:27:03 So as you’ve heard,
00:27:06 all four individuals had to make course adjustments,
00:27:10 step out of their comfort zone,
00:27:12 and take a leap of faith.
00:27:15 Their stories helped us to appreciate
00:27:17 that it is never too late to serve Jehovah
00:27:21 in new and expanded ways.
00:27:24 And when we take that leap of faith as did these two couples,
00:27:29 what will Jehovah do for us?
00:27:32 Recall Jesus’ words at Matthew 17:20:
00:27:37 “If you have faith the size of a mustard grain,
00:27:41 “you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’
00:27:45 and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”
00:27:51 You see, unlike a book,
00:27:55 your story is far from over.
00:27:58 It is not locked-in, finished.
00:28:02 There is still time to make revisions and add new chapters.
00:28:07 And if you take that leap of faith,
00:28:10 Jehovah promises to move mountains
00:28:13 and nothing will be impossible for you.
00:28:19 We look forward to being with you again
00:28:21 on the next edition of The Inside Story.
00:28:52 Well, thank you very much, Brother Chilton
00:28:54 and those who joined you in this presentation.
00:28:58 It certainly was very encouraging —wasn’t it?—
00:29:01 for us to see and be reminded that it’s true
00:29:04 that some perhaps start pioneering in their teenage years
00:29:08 but then others a little later,
00:29:10 so never feel that you are locked-in to a certain decision.
00:29:14 So, what a good encouragement that was!
