In recent years,
we’ve enjoyed watching <i>The Inside Story,</i>

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:10.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it really has helped us to get to know
some of the students a little better

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to get “the inside story.”

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s enjoy this presentation
of <i>The Inside Story</i>

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
as presented by one of the other lecturers,

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:23.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the instructors, in Gilead,
Brother Richard Chilton.

00:00:25.308 --> 00:00:27.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us have a story.

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:30.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how is that story written?

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:36.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
A literal book contains
a beginning, a middle, and an end.

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:39.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by the time
we hold that book in our hand,

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:43.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
each chapter
has been carefully analyzed and locked-in.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
That story is done, finished.

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:50.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what about us?

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you ever feel that your story

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:56.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
is pretty much locked-in, finished?

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:58.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the opportunity to make changes

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:02.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
in connection with your service to Jehovah
has passed you by?

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, please pay special attention

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:09.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what our guests
have to share with us today

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:13.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:42.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first couple we would like to introduce

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:46.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Tomáš and Eva Maruška from Slovakia.

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:01.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Tomáš and Eva, it is so nice
to have you with us

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:03.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:04.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:05.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:10.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we understand that you both grew up
in a country that was under ban.

00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:12.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:16.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember growing up
when the group was under ban,

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:20.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a change came later in 1989,
at the end of the year.

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:22.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then finally in 1993,

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work was officially registered
as Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
During a ban,

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the things are very different
from what we know today.

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, there are no assemblies

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:34.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no conventions at all
held publicly like today.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, no Kingdom Halls
were available at that time.

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:39.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did you hold your meetings

00:02:39.475 --> 00:02:42.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
if there were no assemblies
and no Kingdom Halls?

00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:43.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I remember

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:47.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they were held in small groups
in the private homes of our brothers,

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:50.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and usually they were held
very late in the evening.

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:52.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as children,

00:02:52.488 --> 00:02:54.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
we really struggled to stay awake

00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:56.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not to fall asleep during a meeting.

00:02:57.293 --> 00:02:59.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under those circumstances,

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:01.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
how did you handle the matter of literature?

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:04.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there were no officially printed

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:08.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and imported publications
from our organization.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was forbidden under ban.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we had homemade publications.

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:16.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember growing up
with the book <i>My Book of Bible Stories.</i>

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:21.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a transcript of the stories
but with no pictures.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we had to really use our imagination
and just imagine all those stories.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was also in our family.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell us a little bit
about your side of that story too.

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:32.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s very similar, I think.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:36.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents were involved
in literature production.

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:38.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was either by typing or by photography.

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:43.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you were both children
and growing up under this environment,

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:47.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
were you allowed into these rooms
where this printing was taking place?

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:49.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we were very curious as kids.

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
we still tried to figure out what was inside.

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
We called it the secret room
because all the secrets were kept there,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was this equipment

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
for making copies of literature.

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
A simple camera took a photo,
and then with a magnifier,

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:09.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
they could make a different size
of the publication—smaller.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was easier for the friends
to carry to meetings

00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:14.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also easier to hide, of course.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Eva, it went beyond

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:20.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
this secret room in the attic in your house.

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was another method

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your parents used
in connection with this literature.

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:26.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us about that?

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, actually, this literature
needed to be transported somehow

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:34.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the groups that were using
the publications or to the families.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my parents did it in a way

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:39.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they put the publications
in the back seat of the car,

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:41.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
behind the back seat of the car.

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:44.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did you and your siblings know
this literature was in the car?

00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:46.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we had no idea.

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:46.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
You didn’t know.

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:49.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
They couldn’t tell us.

00:04:49.472 --> 00:04:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was also a way
where they put it under our feet.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
And actually, we are six kids,
and I am the youngest,

00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they put like four or five

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:58.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
or six of us in the back seat of the car.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were sitting there patiently

00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:04.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, you know, those cute little faces
don’t look like smugglers.

00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:07.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s obvious your parents

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:11.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
were thinking it through to protect everyone
and to keep the work going.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:15.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
That must have been very interesting,
growing up under those circumstances.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s move now into your teen years

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:21.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your early adult life.

00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:24.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of the circumstances

00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:28.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you had observed
that affected your view, or attitude,

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:32.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward regular pioneering
and just the full-time service in general?

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I was growing up,
we had no regular pioneers at all

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our congregation
and just very few in our area.

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:42.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was there any particular reason why

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:46.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were so few pioneers in your area?

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:51.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say that it took time to introduce
and to understand the concept of pioneering.

00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:56.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes other spiritual goals
were considered as more important

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
because during a ban,
nobody was really preaching publicly.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it took time to understand this concept

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to really have pioneers
in the congregation.

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:09.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I remember that the first one
whom I really met

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:11.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had the chance to work
with was when I was 16.

00:06:11.654 --> 00:06:13.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the time,

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
three special pioneers
were assigned to our congregation:

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:17.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
one couple and one single brother.

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:21.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that single brother
was accommodated in our home.

00:06:21.097 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for us, as two boys, it was really

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:26.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
like having an older brother at home,

00:06:26.102 --> 00:06:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
a spiritual single brother pioneering.

00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:31.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we could really see our first pioneer
in flesh and blood

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:35.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
(to see him alive),
and we could observe his goals.

00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:37.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he spent a lot of time with us.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
So about how old were you then, Tomáš,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you started regular pioneering yourself?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was three years later.

00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:46.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was when I was 19.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was the first one in our congregation.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:53.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried, but at the time,
there was still very little support.

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:56.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had just four regular pioneers
in the whole circuit.

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:59.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then after several months,

00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:01.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was struggling with the quota
and several challenges came.

00:07:01.904 --> 00:07:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided to quit pioneering

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:05.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I came to the conclusion

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:09.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s not really for me,
so it’s probably for others.

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about in your case, Eva?

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:13.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, I never—

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:16.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up, I never had really
any idea what pioneering meant.

00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:18.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I didn’t have a real need

00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
to start pioneering.

00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:24.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first time I started pioneering
was when we were already married,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I set a goal to do it for one year.

00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:30.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then also I stopped after one year.

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:33.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, now you’re in your adult life here.

00:07:33.936 --> 00:07:35.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
What came next?

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I would say
that this was a turning point in our country

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when we got several couples
as missionaries.

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:45.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they really brought zeal,
the pioneer spirit from congregations

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they were pioneering for decades.

00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:50.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this had a really nice influence
on the congregations

00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:52.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also the circuits.

00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:55.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
You had mentioned, Eva,
that when the missionaries came,

00:07:55.791 --> 00:08:00.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
you mentioned a specific effect
they had on the rest of you.

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:01.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to tell us about that?

00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:02.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I think it was huge.

00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:04.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just woke us up.

00:08:04.534 --> 00:08:08.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed us what pioneering means

00:08:08.304 --> 00:08:10.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that you can really enjoy the ministry.

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:13.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we remember
their enthusiasm for the ministry.

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:15.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was really catchy
to hear these missionaries,

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:17.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were struggling with the language.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they were just learning Slovak
—speaking broken Slovak.

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:24.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they identified young couples
and really invested their time and energy.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
They gave us a lot of their free time,
not just during the ministry.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
We made great friendships with them,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and until today,
we have great relationships with them.

00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:38.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you had mentioned
when you were out in the ministry with them,

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:41.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was something that they showed you

00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:42.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
was OK that added to your joy?

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:43.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this is a very important thing.

00:08:43.973 --> 00:08:46.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed us that we can drink coffee
during the ministry

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yeah, good Italian coffee.

00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:50.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, good.

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:51.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made it fun for you.

00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:53.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So where did that lead to?

00:08:53.883 --> 00:08:57.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then later
when we moved to another congregation

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with the nice spirit
and support of the missionaries,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
we decided to start as a couple pioneering.

00:09:03.226 --> 00:09:06.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was around 28 or 29 at this time,

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:08.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we decided to start
in the new service year.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:12.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really saw
and really understood what it means

00:09:12.568 --> 00:09:14.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
that pioneers produce other pioneers

00:09:14.604 --> 00:09:18.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
because within two years,
we had 25 or 26 regular pioneers.

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:19.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s amazing!

00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were supporting, really,
every day the field service meetings.

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:24.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
You never— Sorry.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were never searching
for service partners.

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:30.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anytime you wanted to go in the ministry,
you had a person to go with.

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:35.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah blessed it because after a while,
we had a couple of Bible studies.

00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:38.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were afraid,
but after we started, it was a nice result

00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:40.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah blessed
pioneers in our congregation.

00:09:40.963 --> 00:09:44.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then what was the next change for you
after you started pioneering?

00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:45.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
What came next?

00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:48.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I felt that some change
needed to be done

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:51.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was a little tired of everything.

00:09:51.807 --> 00:09:55.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was working eight hours a day secularly.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was full-time work.

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:58.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was an international company

00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:01.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
where everybody was just concerned
about their career growth

00:10:01.584 --> 00:10:04.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everything
was about the efficiency in the work.

00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:06.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a little afraid to even go—

00:10:06.555 --> 00:10:08.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody ever asked
about reducing their working hours.

00:10:08.824 --> 00:10:11.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like,
like the more you worked, it’s better.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:16.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we started to pray about it,
and finally I went and they granted me

00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:19.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I could work
from eight o’clock in the morning to noon.

00:10:19.902 --> 00:10:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the amazing thing
was that they gave me almost the same salary

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I had for eight hours,

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:28.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
like, for full-time work.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:31.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
So your salary basically doubled
while doing half the work, right?

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:34.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you take advantage of that?

00:10:34.817 --> 00:10:36.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, at the time, the RTO was open.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:41.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I was helping with the
construction of that RTO in our Kingdom Hall,

00:10:41.424 --> 00:10:45.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I started to commute for the RTO
to take care of some technical stuff.

00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:48.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you were helping us
at the RTO as a commuter.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I was working
with food service

00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:54.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with lunch,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I needed to be there at lunchtime.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I needed to go back to my employer

00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:04.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask to move my work time

00:11:04.213 --> 00:11:05.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
 to early morning hours.

00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:10.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I would wake up at 4:30 a.m.
and work until 10:00 a.m.

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:13.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, when they also granted
this thing to me,

00:11:13.155 --> 00:11:15.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw that it was Jehovah behind it

00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:20.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it was nothing normal
in this environment.

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:24.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now with that change, you were able
to fully support the assignment at the RTO.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I could commute.

00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did that lead to next?

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:31.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very happy at the time
because we were pioneering.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were doing a little bit of pioneering

00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:35.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a little bit of Bethel
because of the RTO,

00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:37.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we felt that we were doing a lot

00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:41.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we had to work
and were supporting where we could.

00:11:41.817 --> 00:11:45.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we decided to apply
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:47.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we submitted our application.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a convention,
and a couple from Bethel came,

00:11:50.593 --> 00:11:53.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the brother asked us one question.

00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:54.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still remember that question:

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you willing to serve anywhere?”

00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:59.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were like,
“Yes, of course we are willing.”

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:01.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he asked us,
“What about Bethel service?”

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we never thought about Bethel.

00:12:04.707 --> 00:12:06.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was quite surprising for us.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:11.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we thought
about this encouragement,

00:12:11.547 --> 00:12:15.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
we prayed about it, and we decided
to submit our applications for Bethel.

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:17.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
And surprisingly, within several months,

00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:19.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were invited to serve at Bethel.

00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:22.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so approximately
what were your ages

00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:26.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
around this time when you’re finally
now entering Bethel service?

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:28.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was 31 or 32.

00:12:28.898 --> 00:12:29.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:30.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she was younger.

00:12:30.966 --> 00:12:32.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, she was younger.
We’ll leave it at that.

00:12:32.768 --> 00:12:33.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Real good.

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:36.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you look back

00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:38.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your life now,

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you feel about the adjustments

00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:43.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you made in your service to Jehovah?

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:47.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never regretted any of those decisions,

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:48.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
setting spiritual goals

00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:52.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
—start pioneering, support the RTO,
or apply for Bethel service.

00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:54.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe there’s one change we would make.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would start earlier if we could.

00:12:57.126 --> 00:12:58.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Definitely.

00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:01.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are probably a number of us
that would feel similarly.

00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:04.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re glad
that you did make those adjustments,

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:07.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s obvious that Jehovah
has blessed you for doing so.

00:13:07.336 --> 00:13:09.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for taking time

00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:12.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share your wonderful story with us.

00:13:12.007 --> 00:13:14.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really touched our hearts,
and we appreciate that.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our pleasure.
Thank you.

00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:25.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, we’ll enjoy the company

00:13:25.087 --> 00:13:29.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
of José and Andreina Peláez.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:45.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to <i>The Inside Story</i>
for Gilead class 152.

00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:48.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you think you would ever hear
those words in your lifetime?

00:13:49.612 --> 00:13:51.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.
No, never.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, being at Gilead

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:56.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the surprise of our lives.

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:59.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is definitely
a surprise we never thought of.

00:13:59.522 --> 00:14:02.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we are certainly happy
to have you with us.

00:14:03.292 --> 00:14:07.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you came to Gilead from Peru Bethel.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:11.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before that,
your home was Montreal, Canada.

00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:13.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did that happen?

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:16.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was born in Caracas, in Venezuela,

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:19.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s where I learned the truth.

00:14:19.174 --> 00:14:20.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was born,

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:23.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
my grandmother was a Witness,
so she taught me the truth.

00:14:23.412 --> 00:14:26.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, my mother got baptized,

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she continued raising me in the truth.

00:14:28.684 --> 00:14:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I was ten years old,

00:14:30.853 --> 00:14:35.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
my family decided to move,
to immigrate, to Montreal, Canada.

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:36.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we arrived there

00:14:36.592 --> 00:14:39.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it was my mother, my brother,
and my unbelieving stepfather.

00:14:39.695 --> 00:14:42.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, so you go from Caracas, Venezuela,

00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:45.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Montreal, Canada, at ten years of age.

00:14:46.101 --> 00:14:48.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you wind up in Montreal, José?

00:14:48.737 --> 00:14:51.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was born in Lima, Peru,

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I heard about Jehovah when I was a child.

00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:55.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Witnesses would come to my house,

00:14:55.878 --> 00:14:58.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some of my older brothers
even studied the Bible.

00:14:58.514 --> 00:15:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when I was a teenager,

00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:03.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the political
and economic situation of the country,

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:04.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
my parents decided

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
to move to Canada, to Montreal, Canada.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:09.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
My older brother was already living
in Canada, and he was already a Witness.

00:15:11.093 --> 00:15:14.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suddenly, sadly, soon after we arrived

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a few months after—
my father died.

00:15:16.632 --> 00:15:17.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry to hear that.

00:15:17.866 --> 00:15:18.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:23.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my mom and I stayed with my brother,
and at that time,

00:15:23.305 --> 00:15:26.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregation helped us a lot
to progress and get baptized.

00:15:26.609 --> 00:15:30.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I made it a goal
to share my relationship with Jehovah.

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:33.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then at the right moment of my life,

00:15:33.148 --> 00:15:35.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
I met Andreina and eventually we got married.

00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:39.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happens next
with you two now that you’re married?

00:15:39.488 --> 00:15:40.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we got married,

00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:44.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were not regular pioneers,
but we had spoken about it.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
We definitely wanted
to make ourselves available.

00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:50.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were you doing then if you
weren’t regular pioneering at that point?

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:55.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
We both had our full-time jobs, and we were,

00:15:55.104 --> 00:15:57.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, we were comfortable

00:15:57.072 --> 00:16:01.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoyed both of our jobs—secular jobs.

00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:04.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the idea of regular pioneering
was there, like I said.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a goal that I previously had,

00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:09.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, you know, we had a long way to go.

00:16:09.318 --> 00:16:11.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you had mentioned to me earlier

00:16:11.453 --> 00:16:14.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you were about 16 years old or so

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you first had this goal to pioneer.

00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:16.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:20.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
From 16 to what point
do you finally now reach

00:16:20.362 --> 00:16:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
entering the pioneer service?

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:24.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, so we started—

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was in my late 20’s when we started.

00:16:27.336 --> 00:16:29.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was in my mid-30’s when I started.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wanted to—
Like we said before,

00:16:31.373 --> 00:16:34.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wanted to increase our service to Jehovah,

00:16:34.176 --> 00:16:37.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there were different challenges there
and different adjustments we wanted to make.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a turning point happened at that time

00:16:41.684 --> 00:16:44.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we wanted
to expand our ministry (service)

00:16:44.853 --> 00:16:47.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be more useful in the hands of Jehovah.

00:16:47.289 --> 00:16:50.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
The circuit overseer at that time

00:16:50.492 --> 00:16:53.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
was Brother John Pappino
and his wife, Sister Carla Pappino,

00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:57.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they encouraged us very much
to take on regular pioneering.

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:59.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I remember being with them

00:16:59.668 --> 00:17:03.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
out in the ministry during the week
when they would come to the congregation,

00:17:03.505 --> 00:17:06.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’d always make a stop
and go for coffee.

00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:08.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we would enjoy their experiences

00:17:08.844 --> 00:17:12.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just that happiness
that we would see in them.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:13.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
After each visit,

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:16.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
for family worship, we would discuss and see

00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:19.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we could then simplify our lives.

00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:20.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that was it

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:22.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we needed to simplify our lives.

00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:26.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we started by, you know,
regularly auxiliary pioneering.

00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:28.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we became—

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:32.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then eventually, we started
this new chapter of our lives:

00:17:32.401 --> 00:17:34.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
We became regular pioneers.

00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:38.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re in your early to mid-30’s;
you’re in your late 20’s;

00:17:38.741 --> 00:17:41.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now with that encouragement,
you’re entering the pioneer service.

00:17:41.577 --> 00:17:43.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s good.

00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:45.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
So did pioneering—?

00:17:45.013 --> 00:17:48.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once you started pioneering,
is that what now stirred your desire

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
to want to serve where the need was greater?

00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:53.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh no, not at all.

00:17:53.388 --> 00:17:58.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, we always thought
that serving in another country

00:17:58.026 --> 00:18:01.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
or where the need is greater
even in the country we were in

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
was maybe an experience
from the <i>Yearbook,</i>

00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:05.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not for us.

00:18:06.101 --> 00:18:08.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thought that we
just had waited too long probably

00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:10.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make those types of decisions.

00:18:10.372 --> 00:18:11.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was not something

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we thought we could do.

00:18:14.643 --> 00:18:15.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Correct, that’s it.

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:19.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times we thought
that we had waited too long

00:18:19.548 --> 00:18:21.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
to start regular pioneering.

00:18:21.216 --> 00:18:25.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the idea of serving in another country

00:18:25.287 --> 00:18:26.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
never came to our mind.

00:18:26.622 --> 00:18:29.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, another turning point in our life

00:18:29.391 --> 00:18:34.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the encouragement
of Brother John Pappino and his wife.

00:18:34.563 --> 00:18:36.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you had mentioned to me earlier

00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:40.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Brother Pappino
gave you an illustration . . .

00:18:40.936 --> 00:18:42.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:18:42.304 --> 00:18:44.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . that really got you thinking.

00:18:44.139 --> 00:18:44.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:18:44.907 --> 00:18:46.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:49.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we were deciding to move,

00:18:49.444 --> 00:18:51.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were always fears

00:18:51.914 --> 00:18:54.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
(certain fears),

00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:58.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the fact
that we had kind of made the decision to go.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I mentioned this to Brother Pappino
—about the fears we had.

00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:04.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he gave me an illustration.

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:06.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told me:

00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:11.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Imagine there’s a father,
and in front of him is a table.

00:19:11.133 --> 00:19:16.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And on top of the table is his child
—his baby child of two years old.

00:19:16.605 --> 00:19:20.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then all of a sudden,
imagine that the child jumps to the floor.”

00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:22.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he asked me,

00:19:22.144 --> 00:19:24.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What do you think
the father is going to do?”

00:19:24.446 --> 00:19:28.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said, “Well, he’s going to
right away try to grab his baby

00:19:28.483 --> 00:19:30.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help him to avoid
hitting his face on the floor.”

00:19:30.686 --> 00:19:31.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he told me,

00:19:31.787 --> 00:19:34.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, that’s exactly what Jehovah
is going to do if you jump to Peru,

00:19:34.957 --> 00:19:36.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you step over to Peru.”

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:39.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was beautiful.

00:19:39.027 --> 00:19:42.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that gave us the strength, you can say,

00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:44.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
to achieve

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:47.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make our decision
to move to Peru.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:52.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what an illustration
to get your minds and hearts thinking on it!

00:19:52.674 --> 00:19:53.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:53.075 --> 00:19:55.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like he said, there were many fears.

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:58.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also we had our lives in Canada,
our families.

00:19:58.947 --> 00:20:01.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had never been away from our families,

00:20:01.216 --> 00:20:05.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the encouragement we received
definitely made a good impression.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we prayed about it.

00:20:07.422 --> 00:20:11.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yes, we thought
that it was possible for us.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was not easy.

00:20:12.928 --> 00:20:17.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still needed to make certain adjustments.

00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:19.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Brother Pappino

00:20:19.868 --> 00:20:21.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
was always encouraging us.

00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:25.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he said: “Just try it
for one year or two, just to try it.

00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:29.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If something doesn’t work,
then you can always come back.

00:20:29.411 --> 00:20:31.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you can taste what it is.”

00:20:32.214 --> 00:20:35.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
What difference did that make for you
—for him to give you that encouragement

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:38.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just put it in the context
of just a year or two?

00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:41.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did that affect your decision at all?

00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:43.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a way, yes because, you know,

00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:46.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
 the idea of moving was a big change.

00:20:47.195 --> 00:20:49.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a big decision for us.

00:20:49.197 --> 00:20:52.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
And having in mind
that we could go for one year

00:20:52.401 --> 00:20:54.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
—try it out and then come back—

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:59.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
kind of smoothed the fears, you know.

00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:01.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was a good example for us.

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:05.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we made the decision to move.

00:21:05.147 --> 00:21:07.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
We made certain adjustments in our life,

00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:09.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our secular work.

00:21:09.885 --> 00:21:13.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
We sold our belongings, and we set a date.

00:21:13.288 --> 00:21:14.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a date.

00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:16.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
We said, “By the end of this year

00:21:16.158 --> 00:21:19.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
(that was in 2012)
we need to go to Peru.”

00:21:19.461 --> 00:21:20.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:20.062 --> 00:21:23.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you got down there,
and where did you go once you arrived there?

00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:27.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
We arrived in Lima,
and just a few weeks after,

00:21:27.402 --> 00:21:29.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
we moved to Tacna.

00:21:29.071 --> 00:21:33.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a city in the south of Peru,
bordering with Chile.

00:21:33.675 --> 00:21:36.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
We took a bus from Lima to Tacna.

00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:40.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was 22 hours of travel
—a trip of 22 hours.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the south of Peru is desert.

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:47.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you could imagine that after five hours,
six hours, seven hours, ten hours,

00:21:47.122 --> 00:21:50.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
all I saw on my left was sand,
on my right was sand,

00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:52.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the back was sand,
and in the front was sand.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:54.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said to Andreina,
“Where are we going?”

00:21:54.596 --> 00:21:58.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had no idea it was like that at all.

00:21:59.034 --> 00:22:00.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
But eventually, after 22 hours,

00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:02.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could see the city.

00:22:02.838 --> 00:22:06.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
We arrived, and yes,
we were not going to live just on sand.

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:08.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was actually a city there.

00:22:08.143 --> 00:22:10.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was going to be our new home.

00:22:10.278 --> 00:22:12.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
It started at the beginning,
since the first day,

00:22:12.381 --> 00:22:15.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah was proving to us
that he was going to be there with us.

00:22:16.618 --> 00:22:20.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then another door opened for us,
and that was

00:22:20.655 --> 00:22:25.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply for the Bible School
for Christian Couples back then.

00:22:25.293 --> 00:22:27.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when that door opened,

00:22:27.896 --> 00:22:32.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
we knew that the idea
of just one year or two in Peru

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:34.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
was going to change.

00:22:34.636 --> 00:22:35.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what happened.

00:22:35.804 --> 00:22:38.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
We attended school

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
one and a half years
after we arrived in Tacna.

00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:42.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when we were invited.

00:22:42.477 --> 00:22:45.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we had received an assignment.

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they gave us the assignment

00:22:47.416 --> 00:22:51.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve
as temporary special pioneers in Abancay,

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:54.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is in the Andes area of Peru.

00:22:54.689 --> 00:22:56.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you went
from the desert to the mountains?

00:22:56.925 --> 00:22:58.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:01.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how long were you there
in your special pioneer assignment?

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was in total maybe five months.

00:23:04.366 --> 00:23:04.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:23:04.866 --> 00:23:06.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why so short?

00:23:06.334 --> 00:23:07.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch office called us again,

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:11.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
telling us that now we were going to receive
another assignment

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work in the circuit work
—serve in the circuit work—

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:16.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the circuit work was going to be in Lima.

00:23:17.913 --> 00:23:21.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you still had
yet another course adjustment ahead of you.

00:23:21.883 --> 00:23:24.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long were you there
in the circuit work in Lima?

00:23:25.787 --> 00:23:30.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after two years
of serving in that circuit,

00:23:30.792 --> 00:23:32.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch office called me

00:23:32.928 --> 00:23:35.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the brother told me

00:23:35.464 --> 00:23:39.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they wanted to see us
at the branch the next Monday.

00:23:40.302 --> 00:23:42.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we said: “Fine, we can go there.

00:23:42.204 --> 00:23:44.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be there next Monday at 8:00 a.m.”

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, “Just make sure to bring
your things to stay two weeks with us.”

00:23:49.544 --> 00:23:51.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two weeks?

00:23:51.213 --> 00:23:53.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was going through your mind
when they told you that?

00:23:53.415 --> 00:23:55.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
We actually had no idea.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told us it’s training.

00:23:57.018 --> 00:23:58.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Training.

00:23:58.086 --> 00:23:59.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we went for two weeks.

00:23:59.621 --> 00:24:00.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:01.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then

00:24:01.656 --> 00:24:04.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of the two weeks,
they told us that they extended us

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:06.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
for up to a month.

00:24:06.761 --> 00:24:09.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
After one month,
they extended us two months.

00:24:09.598 --> 00:24:12.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
After two months,
they extended us six months.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then when all this happened,

00:24:13.969 --> 00:24:15.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said,
“Wait a minute

00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:20.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—two weeks, one month,
two months, six months—

00:24:20.242 --> 00:24:23.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
am I entering Bethel in my mid-40’s?”

00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:24.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:25.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was surprising for us.

00:24:25.614 --> 00:24:27.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and after six months—

00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:28.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe Andreina can say this.

00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:32.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, after six months,
we received a letter that

00:24:32.754 --> 00:24:37.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was our new assignment,
and we could not believe it.

00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:41.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, like he said, we had passed
that age or reached that age

00:24:41.363 --> 00:24:44.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
when normally
you don’t start serving at Bethel.

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:47.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so how long
have you been there in the Bethel in Peru?

00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:48.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been six years.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:49.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Six years.

00:24:49.437 --> 00:24:50.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:24:50.138 --> 00:24:54.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how many years, then,
has it been since you left Montreal?

00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:55.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost ten years.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:56.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost ten.

00:24:56.678 --> 00:24:58.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think Brother Pappino
knew what he was doing

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he told you to just try it

00:25:00.682 --> 00:25:02.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a year or two?

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
He definitely knew the blessings

00:25:03.952 --> 00:25:07.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we were going to enjoy in Peru.

00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:11.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think the best counsel that he gave us

00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:14.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
was to just give it a try for one year
and see how it goes;

00:25:14.829 --> 00:25:16.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was the best.

00:25:16.264 --> 00:25:18.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a whole decade has passed since then.

00:25:18.533 --> 00:25:22.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you look back over those

00:25:22.404 --> 00:25:26.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
life course adjustments, how do you feel
about the decisions you’ve made?

00:25:27.175 --> 00:25:30.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t regret any of these decisions.

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:35.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just feel so grateful
because from the beginning,

00:25:35.383 --> 00:25:37.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
both of our families supported us.

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:41.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also the examples
of brothers like that couple,

00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:44.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
John and Carla Pappino, everything—

00:25:44.492 --> 00:25:46.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve seen how Jehovah has guided us,

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:50.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he has given us blessings

00:25:50.065 --> 00:25:53.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we never saw coming

00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:57.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all these new chapters
that we have added into our lives.

00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:58.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are very happy for that.

00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:01.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we’re very grateful

00:26:01.876 --> 00:26:06.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all those brothers and sisters
who helped us along the way.

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:09.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like my wife said,

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t regret it at all.

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:13.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
We couldn’t do it before,

00:26:13.388 --> 00:26:16.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah knew

00:26:16.124 --> 00:26:17.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
the specific time.

00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:20.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
And looking back,

00:26:20.462 --> 00:26:24.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can only express our deep appreciation

00:26:24.733 --> 00:26:28.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joy for Jehovah’s blessings.

00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:31.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
All praise goes to Jehovah,

00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:33.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are totally convinced

00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:37.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s never too late
to reach out in Jehovah’s service.

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:42.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we are so proud of you both
for making those course adjustments.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s clear that Jehovah has been with you

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and blessing you along the way.

00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:52.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much
for sharing your encouraging story with us,

00:26:52.227 --> 00:26:54.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we pray
for Jehovah’s rich blessing on you

00:26:54.763 --> 00:26:57.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you continue on in your faithful service.

00:26:57.299 --> 00:26:58.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for joining us today.

00:26:58.366 --> 00:26:59.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:26:59.034 --> 00:26:59.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:27:03.204 --> 00:27:06.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as you’ve heard,

00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:10.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
all four individuals
had to make course adjustments,

00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:12.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
step out of their comfort zone,

00:27:12.847 --> 00:27:15.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take a leap of faith.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their stories helped us to appreciate

00:27:17.952 --> 00:27:21.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it is never too late to serve Jehovah

00:27:21.189 --> 00:27:24.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
in new and expanded ways.

00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:29.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we take that leap of faith
as did these two couples,

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will Jehovah do for us?

00:27:32.934 --> 00:27:37.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall Jesus’ words at Matthew 17:20:

00:27:37.505 --> 00:27:41.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you have faith
the size of a mustard grain,

00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:45.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will say to this mountain,
‘Move from here to there,’

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it will move,
and nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:27:51.953 --> 00:27:55.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, unlike a book,

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
your story is far from over.

00:27:58.326 --> 00:28:02.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not locked-in, finished.

00:28:02.364 --> 00:28:07.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is still time
to make revisions and add new chapters.

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:10.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you take that leap of faith,

00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:13.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises to move mountains

00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:18.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:21.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to being with you again

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the next edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:28:52.714 --> 00:28:54.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you very much, Brother Chilton

00:28:54.883 --> 00:28:58.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who joined you
in this presentation.

00:28:58.953 --> 00:29:01.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly was very encouraging
—wasn’t it?—

00:29:01.022 --> 00:29:04.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to see and be reminded that it’s true

00:29:04.592 --> 00:29:08.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some perhaps start pioneering
in their teenage years

00:29:08.196 --> 00:29:10.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then others a little later,

00:29:10.265 --> 00:29:14.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
so never feel that you are locked-in
to a certain decision.

00:29:14.469 --> 00:29:17.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what a good encouragement that was!
