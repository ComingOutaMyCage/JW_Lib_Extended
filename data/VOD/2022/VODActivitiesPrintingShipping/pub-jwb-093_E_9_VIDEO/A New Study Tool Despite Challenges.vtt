Everything about <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:06.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
is different from any other publication

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:07.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve produced in the past.

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:09.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from the start of the project,

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:10.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
two things were critical:

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:13.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
good communication and good documentation.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
But honestly, time and again,

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
the thing that proved
to be the most important

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
was reliance on Jehovah.

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Writing Committee’s goal was to create

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
a first-class digital experience

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:24.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would engage Bible students.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:28.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
The digital design system
had to be completely remodeled

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i> would look uniform

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s viewed in <i>JW Library®,</i>

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org, or in print.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:37.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right from the inception of this project,

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:38.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers looked for input

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the study material would be

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
easily available
in as many languages as possible.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for that reason,
a team from Translation Services

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked along with the writers.

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:51.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
A publication of this size would usually take

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
about two or three years to complete,

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:54.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the Writing Committee

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:57.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
was really interested
in getting the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:58.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
out there as soon as possible.

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:00.664 line:10% position:50% align:center
The <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:02.666 line:10% position:50% align:center
required an intense amount of collaboration.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.751 line:10% position:50% align:center
Right from the beginning,

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:04.752 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Writing Committee

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:06.378 line:10% position:50% align:center
got all six departments together

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:08.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we could work unitedly
through the production.

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our existing tool set didn’t have the ability

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
to style digital publications
like we can with print.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could do black text
on a white background with gray boxes.

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the extent of the functionality
that we had available.

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:59.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i> 
is very interactive for the student.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
When producing the audio
for this publication,

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:04.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
we endeavored to maintain that feel.

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we added multiple voices, musical cues

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:10.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in some cases,
the audio track for the video

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:13.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
was reedited to teach the point effectively.

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got to Lesson 32,

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:17.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
we felt that it might be too complicated

00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:19.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build as a digital experience,

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that’s when
the collaboration really paid off.

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:24.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took every tool that we had

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and basically every trick in order to build

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
the digital version of that lesson.

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:31.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we were working on the prototype,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would collaborate
with the User Experience Group

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:36.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that the look and feel
of the digital edition

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the same whether it was on a large device

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a small device.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
The entire chart is a visual aid.

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:44.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wanted to be sure
that all of our users,

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:46.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially those who are visually impaired,

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:49.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be able to understand
the teaching point.

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
This required us to build the chart

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that screen readers could read the text

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:57.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that each picture would have
a description for those who needed it.

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in the concept stage,
we understood that there would be

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 200 videos in this publication,

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:05.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
requiring thousands of hours of work:

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:07.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
eight brand new videos

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of the remaining videos,
around 60 would need to be edited.

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:14.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as eight new videos
were entering their production phase,

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
COVID-19 hit,
effectively halting

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
video production around the world.

00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
This work stoppage continued
until each branch could determine

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:24.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they could film safely

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still meet the deadline
only nine months away.

00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:30.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the pandemic,
photo sessions here at headquarters

00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:32.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
were completely stopped for four months.

00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:36.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as things progressed,
we were able to resume photography,

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:38.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
only by adhering to strict protocols.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:41.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we had a family photograph themselves

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
while being directed
by the Art Department here.

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
So everything that a Bible study conductor
had been trained to do

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:49.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
—ask all the important questions,

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
develop love for Jehovah
in their Bible students, show videos—

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:55.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s all built into the publication.

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
So would the concept work
with actual Bible students?

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:00.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find out, we did in-house testing.

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:02.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then at the same time,

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:05.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
we sent out the lessons
around the world to publishers, pioneers,

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:07.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
missionaries, and circuit overseers.

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:10.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they used the lessons
with actual Bible students.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tested every lesson of the book this way.

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the responses
that we got back were analyzed,

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we made further refinements.

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had hundreds of team meetings,
and we felt Jehovah’s holy spirit

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:23.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
equipping all of us
after we opened a meeting with prayer.

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:26.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you collaborate,
you get a better product.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s more direct, simpler,
and easier to understand.

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, thinking ahead

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:34.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
about potential translation problems
and addressing them

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:37.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped expedite translation
in hundreds of languages.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that Jehovah helped us

00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:57.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
accomplish this job
in a shorter amount of time

00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a quality
that would have been very difficult

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:01.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
even under normal circumstances.

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:03.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
How amazing Jehovah is!
