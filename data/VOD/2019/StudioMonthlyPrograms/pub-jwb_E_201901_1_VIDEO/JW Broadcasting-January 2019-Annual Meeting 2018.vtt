We welcome all of you
to the January 2019 broadcast.

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:28.278 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The 2018 annual meeting

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.946 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the Watchtower Bible

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.015 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and Tract Society of Pennsylvania

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:35.885 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was held on October 6, 2018.

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:40.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The program consisted
of spiritually upbuilding talks

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouraging reports.

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also included
faith-strengthening interviews,

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as one with a member
of the Governing Body,

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the first part

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:56.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 2018 annual meeting.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme for my opening talk is

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:05.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Appreciating Our Spiritual Paradise.”

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:09.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And such a subject is very appropriate

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a special occasion like this.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let me ask you this:

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When were Jehovah’s people 
taken into spiritual captivity

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Babylon the Great?

00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know that we’ve learned recently

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:27.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was sometime
in the second century C.E.

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—after the death of the last of the apostles,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were “acting as a restraint,”

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:35.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and imitation Christians

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:40.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began to infiltrate the congregation,

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:44.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ugly baby Christendom was born.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, when did that captivity end?

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know
—1919—

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the year when
true anointed Christians

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came out of captivity

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pure worship was restored.

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:05.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that means
that because this is the year 2018,

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:09.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people
have been set free for 99 years

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:11.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—almost a hundred years now.

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:15.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what has been
the spiritual condition of Jehovah’s people

00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these nearly 100 years?

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our condition

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:23.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has become more and more paradisaic.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:25.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today,

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:28.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is truly like an exquisite paradise,

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:32.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like the garden of Eden

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:35.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was truly an exquisite physical paradise.

00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:37.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s compare—

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss some similarities

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:44.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between that original Paradise
and our spiritual paradise,

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:47.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll see it is paradisaic

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this condition that we’re in.

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:52.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s the first similarity:

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The garden of Eden, of course, had a land.

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our spiritual paradise has a land.

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:00.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the land?

00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:05.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The July 1, 1995, Watchtower said

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how “in 1919,
Jehovah brought the anointed remnant

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of captivity to Babylon the Great.”

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it says that that anointed group

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:17.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became a newborn nation.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then it asks, What is the land, though?

00:03:20.483 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the answer:

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the realm of activity
granted to the newborn nation,

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:30.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a place where Bible prophecies

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:33.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a modern, spiritual fulfillment.

00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:34.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did you get that?

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:38.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The realm of activity
where the anointed fulfill Bible prophecies.

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a second similarity:

00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the garden of Eden,

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our spiritual paradise
has beautiful plants and trees.

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:50.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we certainly know
that was true of the garden of Eden

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Adam and Eve were,
but what about in our spiritual paradise?

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are the plants and trees?

00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible likens God’s people

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to plants and trees.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what 1 Corinthians 3:9 says:

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You [God’s people]

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are God’s field under cultivation.”

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or think of Isaiah 61:3:

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:17.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they [talking about God’s people]

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be called big trees of righteousness,

00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the planting of Jehovah.”

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:27.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just like those plants
and trees in the garden of Eden,

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these figurative plants
and trees bear much fruit

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the fruitage of lips,
the fruitage of the spirit.

00:04:35.758 --> 00:04:40.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just looking in the audience,
we see many big, beautiful plants and trees

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:42.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sitting out there,

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:44.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re happy to have you.

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now here is a third similarity:

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:52.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the garden Eden,
our spiritual paradise has abundant food.

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:54.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah foretold it would exist

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:59.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a contrast,
he said at Isaiah 65:13:

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! My servants will eat,

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will go hungry.”

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And especially today,

00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:15.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that contrast is more and more evident
—isn’t it?—

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:17.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between what the people of the world

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:20.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being served
on “the table of demons”

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:23.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we’re being served
on “the table of Jehovah.”

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, they’re served empty calories

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:28.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—junk food, poison food—

00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:33.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have a smorgasbord
of spiritual things, don’t we?

00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have these
not only nutritious but delicious things

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:42.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
served in our publications, meetings,

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:46.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assemblies, conventions, jw.org,

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, more recently, JW Broadcasting.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:53.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is JW Broadcasting

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:57.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the world headquarters

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:02.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see,
I’m still working on that.

00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a fourth similarity:

00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:17.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us
that out of the garden of Eden a river flowed.

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:19.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it must have been a large river,

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:22.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it divided into four other rivers.

00:06:22.098 --> 00:06:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there must have been abundant,
refreshing water in the garden of Eden.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise in our spiritual paradise,

00:06:28.404 --> 00:06:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have abundant spiritual water.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again,
Jehovah foretold it and the contrast.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Isaiah 65:13, Jehovah said:

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! My servants will drink,

00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:43.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will go thirsty.”

00:06:43.953 --> 00:06:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes me think of what one young man

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:48.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was learning the truth

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this is what he said, a young man 
in Africa in his life story in The Watchtower—

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said: “It seemed that my church

00:06:56.766 --> 00:07:00.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“had been giving me ‘acid’ to drink,

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I was freely receiving the water of life.”

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:07.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was so thankful to be set free

00:07:07.877 --> 00:07:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Trinity,
worship of ancestors, and so forth.

00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:15.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives the invitation
at Revelation 22:17:

00:07:15.384 --> 00:07:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come!’ and let anyone thirsting come;

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let anyone who wishes take life’s water free.”

00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:27.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that water represents

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of Jehovah’s provisions
for gaining everlasting life.

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a fifth similarity:

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:36.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the garden of Eden,
our spiritual paradise

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:40.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a place that has
many harmless animals.

00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:42.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we mean by this?

00:07:42.812 --> 00:07:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s what The Watchtower

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:48.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said about this,

00:07:48.784 --> 00:07:51.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or I should say Isaiah’s Prophecy,

00:07:51.087 --> 00:07:53.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning the scripture,
and we should read this first

00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:55.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 65:25.

00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what Jehovah
foretold about harmless animals

00:07:59.962 --> 00:08:02.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 65:25:

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The wolf and the lamb will feed together,

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:09.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the lion will eat straw just like the bull,

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:12.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the serpent’s food will be dust.

00:08:12.308 --> 00:08:14.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They will do no harm nor cause any ruin

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all my holy mountain,’ says Jehovah.”

00:08:17.513 --> 00:08:20.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’ll be a literal fulfillment
of this in the new world,

00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:22.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there’s a figurative

00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:24.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a spiritual—
fulfillment right now.

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s what Isaiah’s Prophecy said

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning that scripture we just read:

00:08:28.724 --> 00:08:31.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those coming into this spiritual paradise

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:35.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make remarkable changes in their lives.”

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:40.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ones that previously had beastlike personalities,

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the book said that with the help of the holy spirit,

00:08:43.973 --> 00:08:46.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they make drastic changes

00:08:46.242 --> 00:08:50.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they tame those undesirable traits.

00:08:50.346 --> 00:08:52.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was the explanation
of that scripture we just read.

00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:56.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a pleasure it is to fellowship

00:08:56.652 --> 00:08:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with you dear former wolves,

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:02.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lions, bears,

00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:06.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serpents also
—throw that in there.

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you notice I said former.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your former condition,

00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:16.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t have wanted to meet
many of you in a dark alley,

00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:19.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you would definitely say that about me

00:09:19.108 --> 00:09:21.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I hadn’t been raised in the truth.

00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what a pleasure to have
these figurative, harmless animals!

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:27.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a sixth comparison:

00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the garden of Eden,
our spiritual paradise

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:34.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a garden that needs maintenance.

00:09:34.223 --> 00:09:37.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, would you say that Jehovah is doing
maintenance in this spiritual paradise?

00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:42.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s Jesus’ answer:
Look in John chapter 15,

00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:46.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 15:2, Jesus said:

00:09:46.068 --> 00:09:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He [Jehovah] takes away

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:52.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every branch in me not bearing fruit,

00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:55.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he cleans every one bearing fruit,

00:09:55.878 --> 00:09:58.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it may bear more fruit.”

00:09:58.648 --> 00:10:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you think
of taking away unproductive branches

00:10:01.617 --> 00:10:04.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cleaning productive ones
to make it more productive,

00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:07.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that not garden maintenance?

00:10:07.056 --> 00:10:08.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about us?

00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:10.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we expected to do maintenance?

00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:13.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here is what
the Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will book said:

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:17.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your faith has brought
you into a spiritual paradise.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Benefiting from that paradise,

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:25.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have the responsibility
to help maintain it.”

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:30.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the book went on to say
that by applying Bible counsel,

00:10:30.112 --> 00:10:33.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we help maintain our spiritual paradise.

00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one more similarity, number seven:

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:38.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our spiritual paradise,

00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the garden of Eden,

00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:43.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has boundaries.

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:47.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, regarding the garden of Eden,
here’s what the Insight book said:

00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:50.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It seems to have been an enclosed area,

00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:55.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bounded, no doubt, by natural barriers.”

00:10:55.438 --> 00:10:59.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it went on to say
that it had an entrance on the eastern side,

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:03.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that, of course, was where
the cherubs were placed to block the entrance.

00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:06.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about our spiritual paradise?

00:11:06.248 --> 00:11:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the boundaries?

00:11:07.683 --> 00:11:11.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here are a few examples:
1 Corinthians 5:11

00:11:11.053 --> 00:11:15.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—stop keeping company
with anyone who gets disfellowshipped.

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re separate
—a boundary.

00:11:18.027 --> 00:11:20.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 18:4
—get out of Babylon the Great.

00:11:20.796 --> 00:11:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re separate
—a boundary.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about John 17:14?

00:11:25.668 --> 00:11:30.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must be no part of the world
as Jesus was no part of the world.

00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:32.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re separate
—a boundary.

00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But interestingly,
Satan the Devil was able to lure

00:11:37.313 --> 00:11:41.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam and Eve
out of their beautiful paradise home,

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s trying very hard
to lure every one of us here

00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the boundaries
of our wonderful spiritual paradise.

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re determined
that we’re not going to let that happen.

00:11:53.929 --> 00:11:55.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there, we have seven similarities,

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure you can think of others.

00:11:57.933 --> 00:12:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But truly, the situation we’re in

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the condition as Jehovah’s people—

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is paradisaic.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is proof,

00:12:07.209 --> 00:12:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reality of this spiritual paradise,

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is proof that a literal paradise

00:12:13.082 --> 00:12:18.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will likewise soon become reality.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:22.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now moving ahead in our program,

00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:25.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to have
a privilege to look at a video.

00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:27.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The title of it is

00:12:27.229 --> 00:12:31.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage to Stand Firm in a Time of Trial.

00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:35.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our video
will be narrated by Brother Rick Ford,

00:12:35.538 --> 00:12:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves as the overseer

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:40.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the headquarters Museum Department

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:42.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Warwick.

00:12:42.077 --> 00:12:44.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re going to enjoy this.

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:47.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Ford is going to really tell you

00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:50.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about something
you’re going to look forward to visiting.

00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:52.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s look at the monitors, please.

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:59.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage to stand firm in a time of trial

00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:03.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s the story of the Bible Students

00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:06.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 1914 to 1919

00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the theme of a new exhibit
at world headquarters.

00:13:13.108 --> 00:13:16.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The tests they faced
in those few pivotal years

00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are part of our spiritual heritage

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can strengthen our courage now

00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:25.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for what lies ahead.

00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:33.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the years just before 1914,

00:13:33.162 --> 00:13:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anticipation was high.

00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:38.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since 1876,

00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charles Taze Russell had published 
that the Gentile Times

00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:45.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would end in October 1914.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many believed it would mean 
the end of their preaching work

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their being taken 
to heaven to rule with Christ.

00:13:55.317 --> 00:13:59.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible Students spread 
their message by every means possible:

00:13:59.655 --> 00:14:02.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tracts, pamphlets,

00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:04.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then in 1886

00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:07.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with The Plan of the Ages

00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the first book in the Millennial Dawn series

00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:13.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(later called Studies in the Scriptures).

00:14:13.669 --> 00:14:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In December 1911,

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:21.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Russell embarked 
on an around-the-world tour.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he went on an 8,000-mile (12,900-km)

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
transcontinental train tour in 1913.

00:14:28.717 --> 00:14:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When 1914 came,

00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so did a new way to expand the work.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “Photo-Drama of Creation.”

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:51.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible’s message 
was now reaching millions.

00:14:51.006 --> 00:14:54.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would 1914 turn out as they had hoped?

00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:58.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On June 28,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Austria’s Archduke Ferdinand 
was assassinated,

00:15:01.951 --> 00:15:04.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
triggering the start of the Great War.

00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:07.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The end of the Gentile Times

00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:10.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seemed to be fulfilling expectations.

00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:16.165 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We held a convention at Columbus, Ohio.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:20.703 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I recall how that on June the 28th

00:15:20.703 --> 00:15:24.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right in the midst of that convention,

00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:26.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why, there was a shot fired

00:15:26.775 --> 00:15:29.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was heard around the world.

00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we read the newspaper,
we said: “Aha!

00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:37.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There it is, there it is.

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Gentile Times
are drawing to their close.”

00:15:43.225 --> 00:15:46.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But 1914 brought unexpected trials

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would test the Bible Students’ faith

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as never before.

00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The year 1914 came, and it went.

00:15:56.405 --> 00:15:59.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Contrary to expectations,

00:15:59.608 --> 00:16:02.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the heavenly reward did not come.

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:07.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they wondered how much longer
they would need to preach,

00:16:07.983 --> 00:16:11.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they confronted 
a devastating turn of events.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:14.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Russell died suddenly

00:16:14.256 --> 00:16:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on October 31, 1916.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:20.562 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We did not know what to do.

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:22.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was so unexpected,

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:25.901 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and yet Russell had tried to prepare us for it.

00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:27.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would we do?

00:16:27.936 --> 00:16:32.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first shock of our loss
of C. T. Russell was the worst.

00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:36.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For those first few days,
our future was a blank wall.

00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:38.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, some felt

00:16:38.814 --> 00:16:41.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all that God saw fit to reveal

00:16:41.517 --> 00:16:43.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had come through Brother Russell,

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:46.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the revelation
of truth had now ended.

00:16:48.691 --> 00:16:52.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Joseph F. Rutherford
was selected as the new president,

00:16:52.661 --> 00:16:56.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dissent arose among the Society’s directors.

00:16:56.832 --> 00:17:01.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On July 17, 1917,

00:17:01.136 --> 00:17:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the tension exploded with the publication
of The Finished Mystery

00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:08.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the seventh volume
of Studies in the Scriptures,

00:17:08.877 --> 00:17:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based largely
on Brother Russell’s earlier writings.

00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:15.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that morning, a lengthy debate erupted

00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right in the Bethel dining room.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Vicious charges were hurled 
against Rutherford and his oversight.

00:17:23.325 --> 00:17:28.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although four Society directors
were soon dismissed from Bethel,

00:17:28.163 --> 00:17:31.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they soon began spreading their opposition

00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:35.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by an extensive speaking
and letter-writing campaign

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that threatened to divide the organization.

00:17:38.774 --> 00:17:41.810 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To disorganize the congregation,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.879 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they tried to put Brother Rutherford out.

00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:45.547 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So my uncle, he said:

00:17:45.547 --> 00:17:48.183 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Well, this didn’t happen in Brother Russell’s day.

00:17:48.183 --> 00:17:50.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m going to quit the whole business

00:17:50.552 --> 00:17:53.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just read Brother Russell’s books.”

00:17:53.122 --> 00:17:55.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said,
“Well, I’m not going to quit the Society!”

00:17:55.891 --> 00:18:00.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced
that the Society was God’s arrangement.

00:18:00.062 --> 00:18:03.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another threat soon emerged.

00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:07.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Distribution of The Finished Mystery
sparked renewed opposition

00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:10.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from religious and political leaders.

00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:13.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book was banned

00:18:13.442 --> 00:18:17.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—first in Canada
and then in the United States.

00:18:17.379 --> 00:18:20.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the Bible Students respond?

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They launched a courageous campaign

00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:27.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distribute Kingdom News No. 1,
No. 2, and No. 3.

00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:31.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These boldly exposed clergy abuses

00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:35.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and defended
the Bible Students’ Scriptural position.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with the war still raging,

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the next challenge demanded attention.

00:18:40.969 --> 00:18:43.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many countries,

00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:47.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers took a neutral stand
as conscientious objectors.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.245 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were put into cells

00:18:50.245 --> 00:18:52.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that were more like dungeons.

00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:56.819 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Due to our refusal to undergo military drill,

00:18:56.819 --> 00:18:58.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a number of us

00:18:58.153 --> 00:18:59.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were taken to a secluded part

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:00.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the prison yard.

00:19:00.923 --> 00:19:02.224 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Lined up there were

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:04.059 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a number of men in uniform

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:05.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with canes in their hands.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One by one,

00:19:07.129 --> 00:19:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were ordered
to run the length of the court.

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:12.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the pace was too slow, we were seized

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:15.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dragged the distance and subjected

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to lashes on the back and legs.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beyond those persecuted
for refusing military service,

00:19:22.344 --> 00:19:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others endured physical abuse instigated

00:19:25.814 --> 00:19:29.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the clergy
because of their courageous preaching.

00:19:29.651 --> 00:19:33.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any uncertainty 
that our brothers may have felt

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:37.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was only intensified by what happened next.

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:39.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On May 7, 1918,

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:43.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
federal arrest warrants were issued

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:46.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Joseph Rutherford and seven associates.

00:19:46.735 --> 00:19:49.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were charged 
with causing insubordination,

00:19:49.972 --> 00:19:53.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disloyalty, and refusal of duty in the military

00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:57.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and naval forces of the United States.

00:19:57.379 --> 00:20:00.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A month later, they were pronounced guilty

00:20:00.983 --> 00:20:03.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given concurrent sentences

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ranging from ten to twenty years

00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:09.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a federal penitentiary.

00:20:10.025 --> 00:20:13.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Brooklyn Tabernacle was sold,

00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:16.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remaining operations
were transferred back

00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:22.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were dark and confusing times,

00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:26.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah would not abandon
his courageous people.

00:20:28.744 --> 00:20:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On March 26, 1919,

00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:36.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Rutherford
and his associates were released.

00:20:36.718 --> 00:20:39.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeking Jehovah’s will,

00:20:39.288 --> 00:20:41.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Rutherford
scheduled a public meeting

00:20:41.757 --> 00:20:43.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Los Angeles, California,

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:46.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on May 4, 1919.

00:20:46.595 --> 00:20:48.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a test.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:52.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were people still interested
in the Bible’s message?

00:20:52.768 --> 00:20:56.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within 20 minutes after the doors opened,

00:20:56.738 --> 00:20:59.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the auditorium was filled to capacity.

00:20:59.875 --> 00:21:02.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 3,500 showed up,

00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:06.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and another 600
were turned away with the promise

00:21:06.248 --> 00:21:09.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an overflow meeting
would be held the following day.

00:21:09.618 --> 00:21:14.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An additional 1,500
showed up to hear the second talk.

00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:18.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was clearly much more work to do.

00:21:20.562 --> 00:21:24.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bethel operations
were moved back to Brooklyn.

00:21:26.134 --> 00:21:30.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Plans were made immediately
for the 1919 Cedar Point convention

00:21:30.138 --> 00:21:32.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was held four months later

00:21:32.941 --> 00:21:37.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a turning point
that reignited the preaching work.

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:43.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
New tools, including
The Golden Age magazine, were released.

00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:47.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Service Department
was established at Bethel.

00:21:47.422 --> 00:21:49.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Service directors were appointed

00:21:49.758 --> 00:21:52.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to organize preaching in each congregation.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we now understand,
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was commissioned to feed God’s flock.

00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:06.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 46:8 says:

00:22:06.475 --> 00:22:10.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember this, and take courage.”

00:22:14.483 --> 00:22:19.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember how these faithful ones
preached an unpopular message,

00:22:22.791 --> 00:22:27.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they moved forward
despite unrealized expectations,

00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:36.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they stayed loyal
to God’s organization when others did not,

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they suffered
when staying neutral in the world’s wars.

00:22:43.512 --> 00:22:46.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember their courageous example,

00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:49.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take courage now

00:22:49.051 --> 00:22:52.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the days ahead.

00:23:07.536 --> 00:23:10.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Ford,

00:23:10.038 --> 00:23:14.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for sharing
that very interesting theocratic history

00:23:14.743 --> 00:23:18.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning our spiritual predecessors,

00:23:18.113 --> 00:23:20.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible Students.

00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:22.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ve made us very eager

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit our new museum exhibit.

00:23:26.588 --> 00:23:30.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we’re going
to get to enjoy another video treat.

00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:33.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch of the Governing Body

00:23:33.795 --> 00:23:35.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to share with us

00:23:35.797 --> 00:23:40.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some fascinating experiences
from Eastern Europe.

00:23:44.973 --> 00:23:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was serving at the Austria branch

00:23:48.076 --> 00:23:52.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from about the mid-1970’s to 1990.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a small department

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:58.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was assigned
to help certain countries in Eastern Europe.

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:02.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that included
visiting the brothers under ban,

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bringing them spiritual food,

00:24:04.493 --> 00:24:06.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having secret meetings with them,

00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:09.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also strengthening
the local organization

00:24:09.764 --> 00:24:13.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was exposed
to persecution and ban.

00:24:14.503 --> 00:24:17.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would print books on Bible paper

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:20.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in miniature size.

00:24:20.175 --> 00:24:23.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way, more books or literature

00:24:23.044 --> 00:24:25.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be taken to these countries.

00:24:25.747 --> 00:24:29.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The couriers transported literature

00:24:29.184 --> 00:24:32.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to these countries
in their own private cars.

00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:35.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way,
hundreds of books could be transported.

00:24:37.859 --> 00:24:40.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the border, if a courier

00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:43.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be found transporting literature,

00:24:43.031 --> 00:24:45.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would interrogate the driver.

00:24:45.534 --> 00:24:47.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these brothers were trained;

00:24:47.536 --> 00:24:49.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they knew what to say
to protect the work

00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:53.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to not give away any secrets.

00:24:53.074 --> 00:24:56.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually, after a day or two days,

00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:59.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the officials would let them go back home

00:24:59.648 --> 00:25:03.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their home country
but not with their car;

00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:05.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had to use public transportation

00:25:05.086 --> 00:25:08.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because their cars would be confiscated.

00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:12.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brothers had the spirit of sacrifice;
they were willing to risk that.

00:25:12.727 --> 00:25:16.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the majority got through,
and actually every year,

00:25:16.665 --> 00:25:19.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thousands of miniature books

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were transported secretly
to Eastern Europe.

00:25:22.404 --> 00:25:24.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was not just a matter

00:25:24.973 --> 00:25:28.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of us being so clever in hiding things

00:25:28.977 --> 00:25:31.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and getting it to the brothers,

00:25:31.179 --> 00:25:34.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we were always fully convinced
and had evidence

00:25:34.649 --> 00:25:37.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was Jehovah’s holy spirit
that helped us.

00:25:38.853 --> 00:25:41.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we transported stencils

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for local production
so that in their countries

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:48.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could reproduce the same material

00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:51.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with mimeographing machines.

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:54.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In most cases,
the mimeographing machines

00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:57.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were transported secretly
by the couriers.

00:25:57.939 --> 00:26:02.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other method
was to build it within the country.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that there was a brother

00:26:04.713 --> 00:26:06.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was a very skilled engineer,

00:26:06.848 --> 00:26:11.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and under his direction,
they decided to build it themselves.

00:26:11.286 --> 00:26:16.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there were self-made
offset printing presses.

00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:19.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers had a number
of underground printeries

00:26:19.961 --> 00:26:23.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they had dug out
under their own homes.

00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:28.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many cases, the brothers had to do
what they did during the night

00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:31.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because in Communist countries,

00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:34.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had to go during the day

00:26:34.242 --> 00:26:37.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a factory or whatever else
and do some secular work.

00:26:37.812 --> 00:26:40.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it testifies to the great spirit

00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:43.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of sacrifice that the brothers showed

00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:47.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to forfeit so much 
of their private life as a family

00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:52.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do at night the printing
of the spiritual food.

00:26:52.327 --> 00:26:55.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some had only a few hours of sleep,

00:26:56.698 --> 00:27:01.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they loved Jehovah
and the brothers so much

00:27:01.102 --> 00:27:03.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they did it.

00:27:03.772 --> 00:27:06.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no Kingdom Hall.

00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:10.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers
had secret meetings in private homes,

00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:13.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they would not all come
at the same time

00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:17.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if the neighbors
would see certain persons

00:27:17.085 --> 00:27:21.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the time going to a specific house,
there could be suspicions.

00:27:22.424 --> 00:27:25.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And every week, they had the meetings

00:27:25.427 --> 00:27:27.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a different home of the brothers.

00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:30.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this helped to protect the work

00:27:30.365 --> 00:27:34.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it could be kept secret.

00:27:34.135 --> 00:27:38.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Singing was very important
for the brothers,

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:41.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they didn’t have to have
a songbook in hand.

00:27:41.242 --> 00:27:44.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew the text of the song by heart,

00:27:44.379 --> 00:27:46.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and immediately after saying a number,

00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:48.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could sing the song.

00:27:48.783 --> 00:27:52.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That affected the heart
—the emotions of the brothers—

00:27:52.654 --> 00:27:57.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they were strengthened
in their determination to be faithful.

00:27:57.926 --> 00:28:01.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of pressure 
was on the brothers in Romania.

00:28:02.397 --> 00:28:05.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Communist Party tried

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sow distrust among the brothers,

00:28:07.802 --> 00:28:10.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meeting with them separately

00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and telling some brothers one thing

00:28:11.973 --> 00:28:14.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and telling other brothers something else.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it happened

00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:19.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an official posed
as an interested person

00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:23.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was clever enough to disguise that

00:28:23.985 --> 00:28:27.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pretend
to make progress in the truth

00:28:27.489 --> 00:28:30.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not only to the point
of getting baptized

00:28:30.658 --> 00:28:34.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even to the point
of becoming an elder.

00:28:34.529 --> 00:28:38.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was in reality an agent
of the secret police

00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:42.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an aim to find out everything
about the organization.

00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:46.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it did lead to, in one case,

00:28:46.307 --> 00:28:51.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers starting to distrust someone

00:28:51.112 --> 00:28:53.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was actually appointed by headquarters.

00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:56.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these brothers then separated

00:28:56.718 --> 00:29:00.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the organization that Jehovah used,

00:29:00.722 --> 00:29:03.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of them were separated

00:29:03.024 --> 00:29:06.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for not just a few years but for decades.

00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:09.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they were a large number,

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to 5,000 publishers.

00:29:12.066 --> 00:29:15.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They continued to meet together.

00:29:15.036 --> 00:29:17.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were preaching and using material

00:29:17.405 --> 00:29:20.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they had left over from earlier years,

00:29:20.141 --> 00:29:23.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they hardly got
any new material to study

00:29:23.545 --> 00:29:26.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were not in touch
with the organization

00:29:26.147 --> 00:29:29.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was used by headquarters.

00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:33.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attempts to bring the brothers back
into the organization

00:29:33.254 --> 00:29:36.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were made from time to time,

00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:38.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it seemed that the brothers

00:29:38.993 --> 00:29:43.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the separated organization
did not have sufficient trust.

00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:47.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we presented

00:29:47.402 --> 00:29:50.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the leader of the separated group

00:29:50.605 --> 00:29:54.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that one
from the Governing Body would come,

00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:59.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was happy about that
and he had enough trust in that case

00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:02.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to agree that we should have a meeting

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:06.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seriously talk about reunification.

00:30:07.522 --> 00:30:10.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so from the separated group,

00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:13.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were Brother Albu,
who was the leader,

00:30:13.194 --> 00:30:16.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and four of his main elders.

00:30:16.197 --> 00:30:19.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from our side,
there was Brother Jaracz,

00:30:19.434 --> 00:30:23.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our translator,
and I was part of that group.

00:30:23.605 --> 00:30:26.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, there were several

00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:29.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Country Committee of Romania.

00:30:31.446 --> 00:30:36.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that the first night
there were a lot of accusations

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what the others
had done or not done,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which did not create the best spirit,

00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:45.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we mainly listened.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But everybody agreed
to meet another night.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the second night,
Jehovah obviously wanted

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers to unite again

00:30:54.636 --> 00:30:57.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the whole spirit was different,

00:30:57.171 --> 00:31:00.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers talked the matters over

00:31:00.174 --> 00:31:02.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and clarified some misunderstandings.

00:31:02.744 --> 00:31:05.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of the second evening,

00:31:05.413 --> 00:31:08.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that the leader
of the separated group,

00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:12.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Albu, said,
‘Let’s do it because if we don’t do it now,

00:31:12.453 --> 00:31:16.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may never have
another opportunity again.’

00:31:18.026 --> 00:31:20.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the decision was made.

00:31:23.598 --> 00:31:27.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That doesn’t happen every day
that 5,000 brothers

00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:30.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come back to the organization.

00:31:32.507 --> 00:31:36.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From then on, all the practical things

00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:39.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were put in place
to accomplish this reunification.

00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:44.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were asked to merge
with our congregations.

00:31:44.385 --> 00:31:46.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that also took a lot of humility

00:31:46.955 --> 00:31:51.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on their part,
but they were willing to do it.

00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:55.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they were really brothers

00:31:55.697 --> 00:32:00.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their heart and loved the truth.

00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:03.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the reunification was accomplished,

00:32:03.471 --> 00:32:08.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was a wonderful victory
for Jehovah and against Satan.

00:32:10.144 --> 00:32:13.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflecting on the experience
with the brothers in Romania,

00:32:13.748 --> 00:32:16.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that there could always be

00:32:16.684 --> 00:32:20.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
misunderstandings among humans

00:32:20.088 --> 00:32:24.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there could always be 
even legitimate complaints

00:32:24.392 --> 00:32:29.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the misconduct
of some responsible brothers.

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:33.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the important thing
is never to lose trust

00:32:33.434 --> 00:32:36.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is Jehovah’s organization.

00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:38.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s where Jehovah’s blessing is.

00:32:38.673 --> 00:32:41.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees it all.

00:32:41.209 --> 00:32:46.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah uses his holy spirit
to keep the organization together,

00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:50.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what he wants
to have accomplished will happen.

00:32:50.018 --> 00:32:52.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we work with the holy spirit,

00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:55.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah will bless our efforts

00:32:55.056 --> 00:33:00.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will be successful to his praise.

00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:24.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Lösch,

00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:29.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for sharing those captivating experiences.

00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:31.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we’re going to get to show you

00:33:31.959 --> 00:33:34.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a one-minute video trailer

00:33:34.796 --> 00:33:38.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to whet your appetite
for something that is coming.

00:33:44.572 --> 00:33:47.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the beginning,

00:33:47.208 --> 00:33:50.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people have been given a choice.

00:33:50.244 --> 00:33:55.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have chosen to do what is wrong.

00:33:57.185 --> 00:34:02.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others chose to make Jehovah happy.

00:34:25.379 --> 00:34:30.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What you do every day

00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:33.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can make his heart rejoice.

00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:37.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you will make Jehovah happy.

00:34:49.036 --> 00:34:51.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re looking forward to this new video.

00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:53.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question is,

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When will we and our children

00:34:56.277 --> 00:34:58.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get to enjoy this video?

00:34:58.379 --> 00:35:01.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we are happy to inform you

00:35:01.582 --> 00:35:04.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in less than six months,

00:35:04.819 --> 00:35:07.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to be able to have this video.

00:35:07.722 --> 00:35:10.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you don’t look
like you’re too happy about that.

00:35:10.324 --> 00:35:13.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I was teasing you;

00:35:13.294 --> 00:35:15.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was truthful, though.

00:35:15.463 --> 00:35:19.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In less than six months,
much less than six months,

00:35:19.901 --> 00:35:22.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in fact, right now,

00:35:22.637 --> 00:35:25.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to get to enjoy

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the nine-minute epic video

00:35:28.943 --> 00:35:31.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make Jehovah Happy.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the beginning,
Jehovah has always cared about people.

00:35:44.692 --> 00:35:49.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, many of them
have caused him great pain.

00:36:02.543 --> 00:36:05.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some have made him very happy.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus always made Jehovah happy.

00:36:27.235 --> 00:36:30.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan didn’t like this.

00:36:30.504 --> 00:36:34.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He tried everything
to get Jesus to do what was wrong.

00:36:35.376 --> 00:36:37.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are a son of God,

00:36:37.578 --> 00:36:39.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell these stones
to become loaves of bread.

00:36:41.148 --> 00:36:45.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is written:
“Man must not live on bread alone.”

00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:48.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grr!

00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:50.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are a son of God,
throw yourself down,

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the angels 
will carry you on their hands,

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you may not strike your foot
against a stone.

00:37:19.153 --> 00:37:21.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prove it to them.

00:37:22.456 --> 00:37:27.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again it is written: “You must not put
Jehovah your God to the test.”

00:37:27.028 --> 00:37:30.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grr.
Hmm.

00:37:34.869 --> 00:37:37.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See all this glory;

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is mine.

00:37:44.946 --> 00:37:48.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I give it to whomever I wish.

00:37:48.316 --> 00:37:52.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all these things I will give to you

00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:57.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you fall down
and do an act of worship to me.

00:38:00.161 --> 00:38:02.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:38:02.163 --> 00:38:04.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go away, Satan!

00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:07.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For it is written: “It is
Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:11.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is to him alone
you must render sacred service.”

00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:18.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was determined
to make Jehovah happy.

00:38:18.479 --> 00:38:20.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this story isn’t over.

00:38:20.815 --> 00:38:24.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is your story too.

00:38:24.218 --> 00:38:26.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you mean, Dad?

00:38:26.654 --> 00:38:29.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what you do
can make Jehovah happy.

00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:36.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our text this morning, Proverbs 27:11

00:38:37.098 --> 00:38:39.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Do you remember what that says?

00:38:39.433 --> 00:38:40.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:38:40.101 --> 00:38:43.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Be wise, my son,
and make my heart rejoice.”

00:38:43.838 --> 00:38:46.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good memory, Sophia!

00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:49.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That scripture is talking about you.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What you do every day,

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:53.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only big things

00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:55.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also small things you do,

00:38:55.883 --> 00:38:57.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can make His heart rejoice.

00:39:17.905 --> 00:39:20.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember today’s text, children.

00:39:21.876 --> 00:39:23.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’ll make Jehovah happy.

00:39:26.047 --> 00:39:29.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s pray.

00:39:33.988 --> 00:39:35.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, kids.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a pop quiz today!

00:39:37.425 --> 00:39:38.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, man!

00:39:38.692 --> 00:39:40.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:39:41.729 --> 00:39:44.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Sophia, if you ace this test,

00:39:44.532 --> 00:39:47.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be number one
in the whole class.

00:39:56.877 --> 00:39:59.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah!
You’re at the next level.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep going!
Keep going!

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . number one in the whole class.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey!
You got this one?

00:40:22.303 --> 00:40:24.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, here.

00:40:24.338 --> 00:40:25.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Sophia!

00:40:25.573 --> 00:40:27.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want the answer?

00:40:30.077 --> 00:40:31.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, man!

00:40:31.245 --> 00:40:33.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That stinks. You lost!

00:40:33.047 --> 00:40:35.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Caleb!

00:40:35.416 --> 00:40:37.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to play?

00:40:38.385 --> 00:40:41.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on; it’s fun!

00:40:41.322 --> 00:40:43.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um.

00:40:43.157 --> 00:40:45.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forget it.

00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:46.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a loser!

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me play with it!

00:40:49.463 --> 00:40:51.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to play or not?

00:40:56.537 --> 00:40:58.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yay!

00:41:02.743 --> 00:41:04.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah!

00:41:05.913 --> 00:41:08.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nooooo!

00:41:08.415 --> 00:41:12.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb! Caleb! Caleb! Caleb! Caleb!

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:17.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb? Caleb? Caleb?

00:41:17.091 --> 00:41:18.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You going to play?

00:41:21.028 --> 00:41:23.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Sophia!

00:41:23.164 --> 00:41:25.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want the answer?

00:41:43.617 --> 00:41:46.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you too can have success!

00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:22.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s OK.

00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:30.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, thanks.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are certainly
a lot of powerful lessons in that video

00:44:13.334 --> 00:44:15.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our young ones and even for us.

00:44:15.936 --> 00:44:20.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re happy to inform you
that in less than six months,

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able to download—

00:44:22.843 --> 00:44:26.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think you’re going to fall for that again.

00:44:26.513 --> 00:44:29.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the real announcement:

00:44:29.516 --> 00:44:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Some of you with nephews,
nieces, children,

00:44:33.187 --> 00:44:36.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or grandchildren are wondering,

00:44:36.156 --> 00:44:39.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘When will these little ones
be able to see this video?’

00:44:39.426 --> 00:44:43.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’ll be happy to know that the video
Make Jehovah Happy

00:44:43.897 --> 00:44:48.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be posted in over 100 languages

00:44:48.268 --> 00:44:51.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“this coming Monday, October the 8th,

00:44:51.872 --> 00:44:54.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on both JW Broadcasting

00:44:54.508 --> 00:44:57.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on the jw.org website.”

00:44:57.578 --> 00:45:00.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In two days, you’ll have it.

00:45:12.926 --> 00:45:15.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we’re going to get to enjoy

00:45:15.462 --> 00:45:18.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an interview that will be conducted

00:45:18.499 --> 00:45:21.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother Samuel Herd
of the Governing Body.

00:45:21.668 --> 00:45:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s going to interview
four brothers who have a lot to tell us,

00:45:26.607 --> 00:45:30.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he’s going to do his best
to hold them down to 19 minutes.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the monitors, please.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have four brothers with us—

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:41.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Stephen Hardy
is serving in the Britain branch;

00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:45.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lorence Shepp is serving in Peru;

00:45:45.225 --> 00:45:48.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Reiner Thompson’s current assignment

00:45:48.095 --> 00:45:50.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in the Dominican Republic;

00:45:50.431 --> 00:45:54.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and last, alphabetically, is Brother Leon Weaver

00:45:54.201 --> 00:45:57.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is serving
on the United States Branch Committee.

00:45:57.504 --> 00:46:02.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All four of these brothers
have at least two things in common.

00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:07.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, they’ve all served
as the Branch Committee coordinator

00:46:07.281 --> 00:46:12.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of their respective branches
for a number of years.

00:46:12.085 --> 00:46:17.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second,
all four have hit a milestone in life

00:46:17.057 --> 00:46:20.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Psalm 90:10.

00:46:20.027 --> 00:46:24.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, these brothers
are identified as being “especially strong.”

00:46:24.731 --> 00:46:26.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why so?

00:46:26.733 --> 00:46:30.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because their life span
is cresting 80 years of age.

00:46:30.404 --> 00:46:33.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes extra vitality and stamina

00:46:33.207 --> 00:46:38.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to still be walking and talking
at that age and to still be making sense.

00:46:38.545 --> 00:46:40.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Believe me, I know!

00:46:40.814 --> 00:46:42.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked to retire at 80.

00:46:42.816 --> 00:46:46.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body said,
“Not until you lose it.”

00:46:46.153 --> 00:46:48.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Well . . . ”

00:46:48.822 --> 00:46:51.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Weaver,
what did all four of you

00:46:51.458 --> 00:46:54.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find out on May 26, 2014?

00:46:54.628 --> 00:46:58.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All Branch Committees
got a letter from the Governing Body,

00:46:58.966 --> 00:47:02.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that letter told us about a new policy.

00:47:02.603 --> 00:47:04.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that new policy was

00:47:04.605 --> 00:47:08.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that once a Branch Committee coordinator

00:47:08.008 --> 00:47:10.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reaches the age of 80,

00:47:10.277 --> 00:47:12.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would not be able to serve

00:47:12.613 --> 00:47:15.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Branch Committee coordinator anymore.

00:47:15.782 --> 00:47:18.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Branch Committee
would look for a younger brother

00:47:18.852 --> 00:47:20.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could qualify to do that

00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:25.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then recommend the younger brother
to be the Branch Committee coordinator.

00:47:25.893 --> 00:47:28.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would any of you
like to describe your first thoughts

00:47:28.695 --> 00:47:30.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you read that new policy?

00:47:31.698 --> 00:47:36.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Brother Herd,
I remember some words of my dad.

00:47:36.703 --> 00:47:40.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He worked in the circuit work
in his senior years

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but would tell me,

00:47:41.842 --> 00:47:46.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now son, if you see
that I’m starting to lose it,

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you be sure to tell me
and get me to stop.”

00:47:50.684 --> 00:47:52.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oftentimes, we don’t realize

00:47:52.819 --> 00:47:56.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that age takes a toll on our effectiveness.

00:47:56.323 --> 00:47:58.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember as a younger man

00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:02.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking how far would I be able to do this work.

00:48:02.029 --> 00:48:04.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought,
‘Well, maybe at 65

00:48:04.831 --> 00:48:07.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I should step off from being the coordinator.’

00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:09.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody retires at 65.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 65, I felt pretty good.

00:48:12.005 --> 00:48:14.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went on to 70.

00:48:14.007 --> 00:48:16.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When 70 was drifting by, I felt pretty good.

00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:21.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went on to 75,
and I know if that new policy hadn’t come out,

00:48:21.415 --> 00:48:24.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would probably have been setting
it up to 85 or who knows where.

00:48:24.685 --> 00:48:27.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But really, for the benefit of the work,

00:48:27.387 --> 00:48:30.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to have younger men.

00:48:30.357 --> 00:48:31.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Experienced?

00:48:31.358 --> 00:48:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, but younger and vigorous
for the benefit of the work

00:48:35.729 --> 00:48:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the benefit of those
with whom we work with on the committee.

00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:43.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much of the branch work,

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:46.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially with the work
of the coordinator, recently,

00:48:46.373 --> 00:48:48.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has to do with modern technology.

00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:51.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as a result of this,

00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:53.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I was serving as coordinator,

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to use
a younger, spiritually-minded brother

00:48:57.084 --> 00:49:00.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep me up to speed,
as it were, to what was required.

00:49:00.654 --> 00:49:04.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So besides the aging process,

00:49:04.958 --> 00:49:08.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the changes came,

00:49:08.595 --> 00:49:12.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no doubt that it was Jehovah’s decision.

00:49:12.899 --> 00:49:14.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so then for me,

00:49:14.901 --> 00:49:18.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very happy to accept the change

00:49:18.972 --> 00:49:21.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without any questions or any doubts.

00:49:21.942 --> 00:49:25.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there was
an additional paragraph in that policy letter

00:49:25.212 --> 00:49:29.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that said that if a coordinator
is not yet 80 years of age

00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:31.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he feels that now would be the best time

00:49:31.785 --> 00:49:35.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a younger brother
to take on that responsibility,

00:49:35.155 --> 00:49:37.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then his request should be considered.

00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:40.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I was just 75 at that time.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I began to realize
that in the coming years,

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:46.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after a couple of years
with the Britain branch construction

00:49:46.767 --> 00:49:48.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and relocation project,

00:49:48.935 --> 00:49:53.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that the responsibilities
would become even more intense.

00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:57.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of the major
organizational adjustments that we’d have,

00:49:57.177 --> 00:50:01.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that it would be good
to request a younger brother to take over.

00:50:01.648 --> 00:50:04.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just 79 when that change took place.

00:50:04.618 --> 00:50:07.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a very modest thing to do.

00:50:07.154 --> 00:50:09.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers, for your comments.

00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:14.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t help myself; I have to ask this:

00:50:14.127 --> 00:50:17.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were your wives’ reactions
to the new policy?

00:50:17.464 --> 00:50:19.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they leap for joy?

00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:22.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t answer that second question.

00:50:22.369 --> 00:50:25.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Ruby thought

00:50:25.138 --> 00:50:28.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a loving arrangement for us.

00:50:28.208 --> 00:50:31.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And actually,
she thought that it would be

00:50:31.445 --> 00:50:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best for her and for me.

00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:37.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I agreed with her.

00:50:37.317 --> 00:50:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our case, Brother Herd,
down through the years

00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:45.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve been surprised
by many reassignments.

00:50:45.492 --> 00:50:47.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jeanne has always been

00:50:47.994 --> 00:50:52.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
100 percent cooperative
with all theocratic assignments.

00:50:53.967 --> 00:50:58.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as assignments would come,
she would pack or unpack,

00:50:58.638 --> 00:51:01.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever was the order of the moment.

00:51:01.508 --> 00:51:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the new policy, 
she accepted it wholeheartedly,

00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was happy that she
didn’t have to pack or unpack on this one.

00:51:11.084 --> 00:51:14.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Ann’s reaction first of all was,
“What are you going to do?”

00:51:14.654 --> 00:51:18.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she realized
that I’m always involved with my work.

00:51:18.091 --> 00:51:19.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to have plenty to do.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she was fully supportive of the arrangement.

00:51:23.096 --> 00:51:25.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that was the same with Olimpia.

00:51:25.866 --> 00:51:27.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, she was surprised.

00:51:27.934 --> 00:51:29.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were all surprised.

00:51:29.536 --> 00:51:31.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But from the very moment,

00:51:31.705 --> 00:51:34.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just a few seconds after I told her of the change,

00:51:34.875 --> 00:51:37.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she accepted it.

00:51:37.377 --> 00:51:40.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she was willing to cooperate,

00:51:40.247 --> 00:51:42.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as she said,

00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:46.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she knew that this was
direction by the faithful slave.

00:51:46.686 --> 00:51:50.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solomon asked:
“Who can find a capable wife?”

00:51:50.257 --> 00:51:53.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All four of you
just answered that question beautifully.

00:51:54.628 --> 00:51:57.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you remember
the account of Barzillai

00:51:57.864 --> 00:52:00.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2 Samuel chapter 19.

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very helpful to King David.

00:52:02.702 --> 00:52:06.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David offered for him
to be part of the royal court,

00:52:06.406 --> 00:52:10.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Barzillai
had now turned 80 years of age.

00:52:10.977 --> 00:52:13.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He declined because he knew

00:52:13.613 --> 00:52:17.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would not be
as useful in the days ahead.

00:52:17.117 --> 00:52:21.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, the privilege
went to Chimham, a younger man.

00:52:21.888 --> 00:52:25.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that account come to your mind
with this policy change?

00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:29.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced 
that the Governing Body was probably using

00:52:29.095 --> 00:52:33.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that to consider their new changes or policy.

00:52:33.967 --> 00:52:36.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 80 years of age.

00:52:36.136 --> 00:52:38.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was still strong; I was still vigorous.

00:52:38.672 --> 00:52:43.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I do have to admit
that it crossed my mind, many times,

00:52:43.343 --> 00:52:45.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There’s going to come a time, Shepp,

00:52:45.345 --> 00:52:47.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘when you’re going to have to relinquish

00:52:47.514 --> 00:52:50.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your privileges to somebody younger.’

00:52:50.784 --> 00:52:53.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so then when the change came,

00:52:53.787 --> 00:52:57.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I accepted it as coming from Jehovah

00:52:57.123 --> 00:53:01.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had no doubts
that it was the direction of the faithful slave.

00:53:01.995 --> 00:53:03.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I did think of Barzillai.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:07.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then my mind
went to his replacement, Chimham.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized that on our Branch Committee

00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:12.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had several younger brothers
who were like Chimhams.

00:53:12.706 --> 00:53:15.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was at peace with that arrangement.

00:53:15.175 --> 00:53:18.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must admit, Brother Herd,

00:53:18.044 --> 00:53:22.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I reviewed this case of Barzillai.

00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:27.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was one thing
about what he said and did

00:53:27.554 --> 00:53:30.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I didn’t agree with.

00:53:30.657 --> 00:53:34.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he said that he’d like 
to go back to his hometown and die.

00:53:34.961 --> 00:53:36.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, I thought,

00:53:36.997 --> 00:53:40.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll use my energies as much as I can

00:53:40.033 --> 00:53:43.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in other activities
connected with our assignment.’

00:53:43.603 --> 00:53:47.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that is the spirit of all four of you.

00:53:48.508 --> 00:53:51.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At what age did you
dedicate your life to Jehovah?

00:53:51.912 --> 00:53:56.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And describe some of the privileges
you have enjoyed since then.

00:53:56.082 --> 00:53:58.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 13, I was baptized.

00:53:58.318 --> 00:54:02.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By 17, I was in regular pioneer work.

00:54:02.222 --> 00:54:07.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 21, my faithful wife, Jeanne,
and I graduated from Gilead

00:54:07.227 --> 00:54:09.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were assigned to Puerto Rico.

00:54:09.596 --> 00:54:12.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went into the missionary work
in Puerto Rico

00:54:12.699 --> 00:54:15.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for about a year and a half
to learn the language,

00:54:15.769 --> 00:54:18.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we had
the privilege of circuit work.

00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:23.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, the Governing Body invited us
—invited me—

00:54:23.677 --> 00:54:28.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take up the Branch Committee work in Belize

00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:32.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it used to be called British Honduras.

00:54:32.285 --> 00:54:36.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from there,
we were transferred to Nicaragua

00:54:36.056 --> 00:54:39.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Branch Committee members.

00:54:39.392 --> 00:54:42.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from there,
we were deported

00:54:42.395 --> 00:54:45.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the revolutionary years to Costa Rica.

00:54:45.966 --> 00:54:49.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the privilege
to work with Brother Shepp for six years

00:54:49.235 --> 00:54:53.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Costa Rica on the Branch Committee,

00:54:53.573 --> 00:54:58.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there was also
a branch building going on at that time.

00:54:58.044 --> 00:55:02.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, we’ve been
for the last 30 years privileged to serve

00:55:02.082 --> 00:55:07.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Dominican Republic Branch Committee.

00:55:07.087 --> 00:55:09.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the last eight years,

00:55:09.122 --> 00:55:13.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s been our privilege
to serve as headquarters representatives

00:55:13.593 --> 00:55:15.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in branch visits

00:55:15.628 --> 00:55:20.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and getting to know
so many faithful and hardworking Bethelites

00:55:20.633 --> 00:55:23.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in different parts of the world, it truly—

00:55:23.737 --> 00:55:26.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful organization
to be working with.

00:55:27.807 --> 00:55:32.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with me, Brother Herd,
I was 17 when I was baptized.

00:55:32.812 --> 00:55:37.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 1957,
I started to regular pioneer.

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 1965,

00:55:39.819 --> 00:55:43.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
appointed me to be a traveling overseer,

00:55:43.823 --> 00:55:48.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Ruby and I traveled for 12 years,

00:55:48.094 --> 00:55:50.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to 1977.

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:53.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 1977,
they called us in to Bethel.

00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:58.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve been
at Bethel for the last 41 years,

00:55:58.104 --> 00:56:01.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and about 23 years ago,

00:56:01.041 --> 00:56:03.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they invited me to visit

00:56:03.543 --> 00:56:06.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
other branches throughout the globe.

00:56:06.679 --> 00:56:11.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve had quite an interesting
and encouraging time doing that.

00:56:11.251 --> 00:56:15.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve had the privilege of you
being a helper to the Service Committee

00:56:15.355 --> 00:56:18.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body since 1992.

00:56:18.858 --> 00:56:22.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve racked up
quite a life of dedicated service.

00:56:22.195 --> 00:56:26.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized at the age of 19.

00:56:26.399 --> 00:56:30.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took up the full-time service

00:56:30.136 --> 00:56:33.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1958.

00:56:33.406 --> 00:56:38.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1960,
I was appointed to be a circuit overseer.

00:56:38.411 --> 00:56:41.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I served in parts of Ontario, Quebec.

00:56:41.514 --> 00:56:44.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then while serving there,

00:56:44.584 --> 00:56:47.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned to northwest Canada,

00:56:47.554 --> 00:56:50.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included part of Alaska.

00:56:50.223 --> 00:56:53.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after getting there,
only four months or so,

00:56:53.827 --> 00:56:56.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were called to Brooklyn

00:56:56.496 --> 00:57:01.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend
the newly formed Kingdom Ministry School.

00:57:02.402 --> 00:57:04.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our visit at Brooklyn,

00:57:04.938 --> 00:57:08.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Knorr talked to some
of us Canadians and he asked us,

00:57:08.775 --> 00:57:11.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would you be willing to accept

00:57:11.277 --> 00:57:15.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a missionary assignment 
without going to Gilead?”

00:57:15.181 --> 00:57:17.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this was a marvelous opportunity,

00:57:17.283 --> 00:57:19.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was accepted

00:57:19.686 --> 00:57:23.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and later assigned to Nicaragua.

00:57:23.389 --> 00:57:27.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just after a couple of years,
I wanted to get married.

00:57:27.494 --> 00:57:28.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote.

00:57:28.628 --> 00:57:30.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Knorr had kind of softened

00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:33.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his opinion
about getting married at that time.

00:57:33.466 --> 00:57:35.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So 55 years ago,

00:57:35.602 --> 00:57:38.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I married Olimpia,

00:57:38.104 --> 00:57:41.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve been serving together
in several countries.

00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:43.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned to Costa Rica

00:57:43.943 --> 00:57:46.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we served together for 27 years.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on the second of October,

00:57:50.083 --> 00:57:53.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we just completed another 25 years

00:57:53.987 --> 00:57:57.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serving under the Peru branch.

00:57:57.257 --> 00:58:01.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also consider it a tremendous privilege

00:58:01.461 --> 00:58:06.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having been assigned
the privilege of visiting other branches

00:58:06.132 --> 00:58:09.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sharing encouragement with them,

00:58:09.102 --> 00:58:13.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we’ve been doing
for a little bit more than 20 years.

00:58:13.206 --> 00:58:16.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m getting tired out just listening to the work

00:58:16.709 --> 00:58:18.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you brothers have done over the years.

00:58:18.444 --> 00:58:20.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Hardy, your story, please.

00:58:20.847 --> 00:58:25.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I dedicated my life to Jehovah
when I was 11 years old.

00:58:25.485 --> 00:58:30.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I started pioneering at 18,
then special pioneered.

00:58:30.023 --> 00:58:32.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when I was just 22,

00:58:32.025 --> 00:58:35.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I were invited
into the circuit work.

00:58:35.161 --> 00:58:38.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in 1963,
we got a surprise.

00:58:38.364 --> 00:58:40.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were invited to Gilead

00:58:40.366 --> 00:58:43.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from Gilead
we were assigned to Burundi in Africa.

00:58:43.269 --> 00:58:45.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we never heard of Burundi.

00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:47.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So immediately we went
to get our Yearbook

00:58:47.774 --> 00:58:50.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out how many publishers
there were in Burundi.

00:58:50.977 --> 00:58:54.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We looked down the list,
but Burundi wasn’t even on the list,

00:58:54.647 --> 00:58:58.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we suddenly realized
we were going into virgin territory.

00:58:58.651 --> 00:59:03.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sadly, the authorities
in Burundi were not happy about that,

00:59:03.156 --> 00:59:06.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after just four months,
we had to leave the country.

00:59:06.392 --> 00:59:09.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we were reassigned to Uganda.

00:59:09.195 --> 00:59:12.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we served there for ten years,

00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:14.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and again,
there were difficulties in Uganda.

00:59:14.901 --> 00:59:18.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we were reassigned
this time to Côte d’Ivoire,

00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:21.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we served there for another ten years.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, my wife
had gotten some medical problems,

00:59:24.677 --> 00:59:29.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had to return to Britain in 1983.

00:59:29.682 --> 00:59:32.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after some years, she died.

00:59:32.919 --> 00:59:35.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then a little later,

00:59:35.188 --> 00:59:38.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a commuter Bethel sister
in London Bethel,

00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:41.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her desire was to become
a regular Bethelite.

00:59:41.394 --> 00:59:43.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she knew the only way to do that,

00:59:43.763 --> 00:59:47.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to her,
was to marry a Bethel brother.

00:59:48.067 --> 00:59:50.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I found her personality very attractive,

00:59:50.603 --> 00:59:53.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what’s more,
she was a really spiritual person.

00:59:53.439 --> 00:59:55.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I succumbed.

00:59:55.508 --> 00:59:57.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Ann and I—

00:59:57.343 --> 01:00:02.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been serving happily
in London Bethel since 1989.

01:00:02.248 --> 01:00:05.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the other brothers,
I’ve had the privilege of serving

01:00:05.218 --> 01:00:07.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a headquarters representative.

01:00:07.754 --> 01:00:12.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve visited some 60 branches
and have thoroughly enjoyed that.

01:00:12.592 --> 01:00:16.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you
for that brief overview of your lives.

01:00:16.629 --> 01:00:19.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to my notes, all told,

01:00:19.966 --> 01:00:21.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Hardy has served

01:00:21.968 --> 01:00:25.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a Branch Committee member for 38 years.

01:00:25.605 --> 01:00:27.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the last 19 years,

01:00:27.607 --> 01:00:31.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has been the coordinator
of the Britain branch.

01:00:31.244 --> 01:00:34.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Shepp,
according to my calculations,

01:00:34.647 --> 01:00:39.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has served as a member
of a Branch Committee for 52 years

01:00:39.185 --> 01:00:43.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 48 of those years
as the coordinator to a Branch Committee.

01:00:44.624 --> 01:00:46.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Thompson has been serving

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:49.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a Branch Committee member
for some 50 years,

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:51.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 44 of those years

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:55.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the coordinator of a Branch Committee.

01:00:55.134 --> 01:01:00.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you who are newer
to the organization might not realize it,

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:03.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was not
an official Branch Committee

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:07.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the United States until April 1, 2001.

01:01:08.948 --> 01:01:10.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Weaver was appointed

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:14.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a Branch Committee member from its inception.

01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:19.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that is now 17 years 
as a member of that Branch Committee,

01:01:19.726 --> 01:01:24.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has served
as the coordinator for the past 11 years.

01:01:24.731 --> 01:01:27.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being the coordinator of a Branch Committee

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a full-time job
—and then some.

01:01:31.037 --> 01:01:36.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m sure everyone is wondering
what your new assignments entail.

01:01:36.008 --> 01:01:37.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Hardy?

01:01:37.143 --> 01:01:39.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I work
in the Branch Committee Office,

01:01:39.712 --> 01:01:43.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I do some proofreading
of letters to other branches

01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:46.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the different committees
of the Governing Body.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m one of the three brothers
assigned from the Branch Committee

01:01:50.723 --> 01:01:53.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assigned to work in the Service Department,

01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:58.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one of my assignments
is to include shepherding.

01:01:58.164 --> 01:02:02.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had the privilege of calling personally

01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:05.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 97 traveling overseers

01:02:05.338 --> 01:02:08.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talking to them
and to many of their wives.

01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:12.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been able to call
the 52 field missionaries,

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve been able to visit personally
every one of the Bethel family.

01:02:17.116 --> 01:02:19.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a goal.

01:02:19.118 --> 01:02:23.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have 47 very faithful special pioneers

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:26.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are not able to do
as much as they used to.

01:02:26.426 --> 01:02:29.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m starting to call them, and my goal is,

01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:33.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the end of this calendar year,
to be able to talk to every one of them.

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:39.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Branch Committee has assigned me
to the area of what we call BRED,

01:02:39.705 --> 01:02:42.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is Branch Real Estate Desk.

01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:44.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve also given me the privilege,

01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:48.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having participated
in the construction of two branches,

01:02:48.748 --> 01:02:52.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the younger brothers
take advantage of the training programs

01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:54.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have in place for them.

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:58.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Brother Herd,
all of us are still on the Branch Committee,

01:02:58.891 --> 01:03:02.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s still much work to do
in connection to the Branch Committee.

01:03:02.762 --> 01:03:04.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have shepherding to do

01:03:04.764 --> 01:03:08.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of traveling overseers
and Bethel family members.

01:03:08.134 --> 01:03:13.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also still give
our convention assignments.

01:03:13.139 --> 01:03:15.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will do circuit assemblies.

01:03:15.942 --> 01:03:18.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And myself, personally,

01:03:18.244 --> 01:03:22.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to increase
my field service time

01:03:22.114 --> 01:03:26.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my congregation
and with my wife, Ruby.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for your many decades

01:03:28.621 --> 01:03:32.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of loyal dedicated service
to Jehovah and to Kingdom interests.

01:03:32.925 --> 01:03:36.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And along with so many longtime faithful ones,

01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:40.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is heartwarming
to hear that you fully embrace

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the decision of the faithful slave,

01:03:42.768 --> 01:03:46.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if it means
relinquishing a privilege of service.

01:03:48.007 --> 01:03:52.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that in no way
has any bearing on your zeal, energy,

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:55.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enthusiasm for the Lord’s work.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:03.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the four of you and all of the others

“knowing that your labor is not in vain

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:23.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in connection with the Lord.”

To bring to an end this month’s broadcast,

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll travel to Croatia.

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:34.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Croatia is nestled
between five other countries

01:05:34.046 --> 01:05:35.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in southeastern Europe.

01:05:36.282 --> 01:05:39.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has many picturesque locations throughout,

01:05:39.485 --> 01:05:42.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ranging from a beautiful coastline

01:05:42.321 --> 01:05:44.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to towering mountaintops.

01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:48.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are
around 5,000 publishers in the country.

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:51.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In May 2018,
the first foreign-language group was formed.

01:05:53.499 --> 01:05:57.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The English group,
located in the capital city, Zagreb,

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:00.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reaches out to the many foreign workers,

01:06:00.006 --> 01:06:02.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tourists, and refugees.

01:06:02.675 --> 01:06:05.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Croatia is also experiencing growth

01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:08.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the sign-language and Roma fields.

01:06:08.748 --> 01:06:13.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Zadar Congregation
in western Croatia.

01:06:13.352 --> 01:06:16.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 120 publishers there

01:06:16.188 --> 01:06:18.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been assigned a vast territory,

01:06:18.658 --> 01:06:21.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which includes many islands.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2015,

01:06:23.095 --> 01:06:27.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were able to attend
the special convention held in Croatia.

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:29.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the fall of 2018,

01:06:29.769 --> 01:06:32.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they participated in and hosted delegates

01:06:32.705 --> 01:06:36.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a special preaching campaign
in their country.

01:06:36.275 --> 01:06:38.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In their local territory,

01:06:38.644 --> 01:06:41.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they make effective use
of public witnessing carts

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach out to tourists and other passersby.

01:06:45.451 --> 01:06:47.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are ten publishers in the congregation

01:06:47.787 --> 01:06:50.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving as regular pioneers,

01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:55.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seven as elders,
and four as ministerial servants.

01:06:55.294 --> 01:06:59.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All our dear brothers and sisters
in the Zadar Congregation

01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:02.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send you their warm greetings.
