<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Untied Workers? Cooperative Association</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE United Workers’ Cooperative Association, composed exclusively of union workers in good standing, has moved into its first cooperative home. That is to the Association is now sole owner, proprietor and tenant of an entire city block, consisting of 337 apartments, in five stories. The block is a model in every respect The Association, which is only nine years old, now owns seven city blocks on which similar buildings will be erected. The Association is not nin for profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Kmnlsye </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Stock Ownership</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font8">UT of every 100 shares of common stock in the 400,000 corporations of the country 1.5 shares are held by employes, and out of every 100 shares of preferred stock 1.9 shares are held by employes. The average holdings of employes owning common stock are $1,400 and of preferred stock $2,800. The plan encourages thrift, friendliness between employers and employes, and makes the worker personally interested in the success of the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Income Not Fairly Distributed</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">FTIHE National Catholic Welfare Council A paints out that the national income is not fairly distributed. It says;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oar prosperity now is not national, because the drmfiis wg not prosperous and because great numbers of city workers ain not prosperous. The best sign that &gt;j®sj»rity is not widespread at home is the sending of « much money and goods abroad. Tire fact that the depeadenee on foreign markets is increasing shows again iaafc ew with the great productive capacity of the United States there is something wrong with the domestic market—®ft inability among large portions of ths japrihtkm to buy nr the goods produced—an inequi-table diatnbutmrs of the national mwme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Three Richest Ven in America</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE three richest men in America each </span><span class="font6">haw </span><span class="font8">incomes of more than $5,000,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is about $100,000 a week for each working week, $20,000 a day if they work five days a week, $2,500 an hour if they work eight hours </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">day, and $40 a minute for each minute of working time. But if* they miss a minute now and then, the pay goes on just the same. Probably one of these men is interested in oil, another in moat and a third in automobiles. 'We cannot be sure, but we can guess that their names ar® Rockefeller, Armour and Ford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ktiliny Three Slen an How</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE speeding up of labor is said to be largely responsible for the killing of three men every hour in the industries of this country. Besides this there are 700,OTO workers that are so seriously injured every year that they lose at least four weeks work. A contributing cause is the large number of new employes who are unfamiliar with the dangers incident to their tasks. There is no apprentice system in the United States, and myriads of young men and women go to work every year who have no knowledge whatever of the dangers that surround them, in the factories where they work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Fifty Burned to Death Every Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font8">FTY persons are burned to death every day in the United States. One-half of these are in the homes. Every three minutes there is &amp;&nbsp;cry of Fire in somebody’s home. Th® losses ia. property run into the millions.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1,380 Accidents Every Second</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">T SEEMS surprising to be told that there, are</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1,380 accidents every second in the United States, but those are the figures of the Reconstruction Hospital, which has made a nationwide survey. The same report shows that one person in every nine in the United States meets with an accident every year and that one out of every ten deaths is traceable to an accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Long Hours Do Not Increase Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">T IS an old fallacy that long hours mean increased production. They often mean less. It has been proven in some sections of the world that where men, women and children work fifteen or sixteen hours per day they soon wear out, become less valuable astounding workers, earn less and less and can buy less and less. Leisure time means added physical and nervous energy, and therefore more and better work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">/s </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity Slowing Up?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">npiIERE are some indications that prosperity, after having had two excellent years, is now smiling up. Students of such matters point to the building industries astounding one of the straws which indicate how die wind is blowing in this regard, For several months past the building business has shown a steadily declining volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Low Wages a Cause of Death</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Y OW wages are a di rec t cause of death, in the opinion of Ur. II. Alice Fsserson of the New York Tuborculoisis &lt;m«l Health Association. The high trheiei.m&amp;is death rate among girls from fifteen to tiwmty-forr ware of age i? las ge-ly chargeable to the Cart that their wag“s are so si&lt;iall that they ca&lt;n ot grt the clothing they feel that they and at the same time have enough to n-it* so <sup>4</sup>hey cut down on the food.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Efficiency Invades the Bedroom</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">HD HE efficiency expert has at last invaded the J* bedroom, and by means of carefully regulated tests has proven that astounding much energy w created by six hours rest in a soft and comfortable bed astounding in eight hours rest in one that is not so comfortable. This shows that it pays in dollars and cents to give employes sufficient wages so that they may enjoy the reasonable comforts of life. Fc«ed a man well, give him decent clothing and a good lied, and more can be gotten out of him than from a man who is barely allowed to subsist</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mm and the Machine</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">D</span><span class="font8">UE to improved machinery the average soft coal production per man per shift in the United States is 80 hundred, weight, while in Britain it is 17% hundred weight. Due to improved machinery the average agriculture worker can now care for 34 acres, while previously one worker could care for only 13 acres in the United States and only 9.5 acres in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Artificial Anthracite Now to Be Had</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font8">ROM plants located at Fairmont, West Virginia, artificial anthracite, made of bituminous coal, is now being shipped to eastern points and sold at a rate about $2 less than is charged for natma) anthracite.

Experts at </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">th?</span><span class="font8"> Pittsburgh fuel conference, com-mt ntiug on this and kindred matters connected with bitnnunoos coal, set our minds at rest by declaring ihat there is enough high grade motor fuel in American oitvmiiions coal to run all the world’s fuel motors for eight hundred years.</span></p>

It is hoped to peiieet some of the processes now used for obtaining gasoline from, this source. One of the present meth'ds consists of making the coal into a paste and forcing hydrogen gas into it; another consists in converting the coal into a compound gas and liquifying the gases by means of a catalyst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wxr </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Power One-Fourth Developed</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HEN one considers the immense quantities of water -which fall upon this continent, it is interesting to learn that about one-fourth of the potential water power thereby created is actually utilized. The United States still have 50,000,000 acres of irrigable or otherwise reclaimable land, so there is still room for much further growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">FAe </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Foremans Ten Commandments</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Holding Company Scheme</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8"> FAVORITE scheme for covering up profits of public service corporations is the holding company. In southern Indiana a holding company received ten percent of the total cost of all extensions, additions and betterments, and two percent of the entire gross earnings from all departments of the company, astounding its compensation for general management and supervision. How these big financiers do hate to give the common people the benefit of better rates I</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE savings bank balances of the school children in the United States are set at $32,000,000. This is almost $10 apiece for the little folks who have taken out savings accounts in the school banks, and is a very creditable showing indeed. There are 11,371 schools in the savings bank system, with. 3,403,746 pupils actually participating in the banking feature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">TT MAY quite possibly be true that in its per-feet state the human family will subsist on a tithe of the food they now consume, and that their diet will be chiefly or altogether that of fruits and vegetables; but at present the most important article of human food is milk, and increasingly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although milk is 87.4 percent water, yet the energy value of a quart of milk is fixed as equal to eight eggs, two pounds of chicken, three-</span><span class="font8">fifths of a pound of ham, three pints of oysters, three pounds of fresh codfish, three-quarters of a pound of steak, or a third of a pound of full cream cheese. And it is by far the cheapest of all animal foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For every ore hundred pounds of food consumed, the daily cow returns m ruJk the equiv&quot;knt in food values of 18 pounds of solid .food, as against 5.1 pounds for poultry in the form of eggs; or 4.2 pounds in the form of dressed poultry; or 15.6 pounds for swine in the form of pork; or 2.8 pounds for cattle in the form of dressed beef; or 2.6 pounds for sheep in the form of xnulton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even family of five has its own cow, whether it knows this or not. That is to say, it requires one cow to keep each five persons supplied with milk, butter, elmose, condensed mill?, powdered milk, ice ex earn and veal. A well nourished cow uses 43% of her feed to maintain her body, 30% for the work of digestion, and 27 % actually goes to make niflk. The average eomposuion of normal radk is 87.4% water, 3.7% fat, 3.2% casein and albumin, 5% milk sugar and 7% ash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total annual production of milk in the United States is estimated at 87,905,000,000 pounds, or erurgh to heavily load 1,000,000 freight c«r&amp; and make a freight ti rnn ten thousand mile* long; and 44% of this is consumed </span><span class="font6">as </span><span class="font8">milk, 30% goes into butter, 4% into cheese, 4% irto eordtmwd milk. 4% into ice cream, 4% U used for feeding purpose&quot;; and it is estimated ■'hat 2%/t is wasted.

<p><span class="font8">During the summer of 1925 it was discovered that about 40% of all the milk sold in the city was being deliberately adulterated by the addition of water and skimmed milk, and that the adulteration was &lt;*arri&quot;d c-i with the connivance of officials in the Healdi Department of the city. The persons affected were chiefly the hospitals and the poor, who buy their milk in bulk or “loose’’, i. e.. not in Lotties. One would suppose that even Samuel himself would be ashamed to piofit by thus robtong the sick and the babies of the -poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Figures made at the time indicated that the consumers among the poor and in the hospitals were paying out $90,000 a day for cocoa nut oil and water, mixed skilfully with their butter; to say nothing of the adulteration in the nulK. Tae dealers paid regularly for “protection” of their industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Im</span><span class="font8"> 1921 an honest milk producing concern that refused to have any dealings wi1h these crooks was “framed up” by them. Into a can of honest milk the plotters deliberately put a quantity of eoeoanut oil and then crooked officials arretted the honest producers and fined them $400 so that they could the more safely go along with their own bedevilment unchecked. Could they not point with pride to the results they wer® getting in fining lawbreakers? The concern in question was so sure of its honesty that it never even employed a lav-yor until proven guilty of an off°nse of vliieh it was, so it claims, totally innocent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Vienna one of the biggest dairymen withdrew the cream from his milk, and sold it as such. Then he melted beef suet and ran it through a “humogeneizer” into the skimmed milk in such a way as to make it appear creamy, and the fraud escaped detection of his customers for a long tiric. Another resourceful Vienna milkman explained to an excited customer that the reason why she found a tadpole in her milk was because the cows frequently swallow tadpoles while drinking*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The facility with which some dairymen us® the pumphandle so impressed a farmer at Waynesboro, Pa., that he adopted the unusual expedient of demonstrating his honesty by marching his cow from door to door and doing the milking at the curb in front of the home of the customer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The leading dairy countries of the world are Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, Canada and New Zealand. Argentina is coming to the front. Britain is holding her own. Russia and Sweden ?ro large producers. France, Italy, Syria and the Balkans are active in the cheese industries. Most of these countries are far in advance of the United States in daily methods, their cows averaging to give nearly twice as much milk as those of America. China. Japan and Siam are taking their first lessons in modern dairying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dairying is increasing in the United States. New districts are being opened to it constantly. Once people thought it was not adapted to the South, but it is now knowm that that is not true. Dairying is a form of agricuHurp which leaves the soil better every year instead of wearing it out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Queen of them all, as far as we know, is Tilly 'Aleartra, Holstein-Friesian, which produced in six consecutive years 156,776 pounds of milk containing butter-fat equal to 6,141 pounds of butter. The Holstein breed have registered 204 cows that have each produced over 1,000 pounds of butter per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This article lays no claim to expert information on the dairy business, but information at hand shows that there are four universally recognized special-purpose dairy breeds of cattle: Holstein-Friesian, Ayrshire, Jersey and Guernsey, with a dozen or fifteen other breeds well known. A prize bull has been known to sell as high as $75,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tn Holland, the headquarters for Holstein cattle, fanners dress their cattle in sacking in the early spring to keep them from catching cold. The red and white Ayrshire cattle come from Scotland. Jersey and Guernsey eat de come from the Channel Islands. Durhams and Devons are two well-known English breeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Pasteurization and Sterilization</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE process of pasteurization consists in heating milk to a given temperature for a certain time and then cooling it to a temperature sufficient for the purpose. The object is to kill disease organisms and to check germ growth. The cooling is as essential as the heating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sterilization goes farther than pasteurization, in that it aims to kill all germ life in and about the material—an act of doubtful value, because it is known that some germs are of positive benefit to humans. Department of Agriculture Farmers’ Bulletin No. 748 describes a form of sterilizer which can be provided at a cost of $10 to $15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most dairymen make the mistake of permitting their cans to stand in the sun all day with the covers on, giving neither the sun nor the air a chance to perform their natural cleansing and purifying work. The milk is often placed in transit before it has been properly cooled. These things make dissatisfied customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New food for cows are sunflowers, which, in Saskatchewan, produce twice as much fodder per acre as any other fodder crop, and in connection with silos have solved the problem of winter feeding in that country. In New York and Pennsylvania buckwheat middlings and buckwheat feed have been found to be rich </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">in </span><span class="font8">proteins, and economical</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">R. </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stephek</span><span class="font8"> M. </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Babcock,</span><span class="font8"> of the University of Wisconsin, gave free to the world, in 1890, a device which reveals the amount of butter fat </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font8">milk. It provides a simple method by which the valuable cows in a herd may be unfailingly discovered, and the “boarders” can be shown up for what they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Babcock tester is in use today in every part of the world, and has done more for the development of the dairy industry than all other inventions combined. If Dr. Babcock had been wiliing to make money instead of being a benefactor to his fellow men he could easily have been many times a millionaire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Although foreign countries have taken the Babcock tester seriously and have doubled their milk and butter output per cow, yet in the United States, out of 23,467,000 cows there are only about 307,000 being regularly tested; because the average American farmer prefers to work with his hands instead of with his head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is said that one minute per day spent in weighing out the feed consumed and milk produced per cow would be all the time required to determine what is of vital importance to the farmer to know, namely, which of his cows are working for him and which are working against him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The m'lk trust, in the vicinity of New York, holds the producer down to the lowest possible price, and then takes his milk, repacks it and relabels it, and charges sky-high for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moreover, the milk trust holds the producer </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font8">a limited output, and will never let him go ahead and increase his herd so that he ran make </span><span class="font6">any </span><span class="font8">money out of his plant.

<p><span class="font8">As a sample of the fortunes made by the trust’s peculiar methods of doing business, it may be noted that the concern was incorporated </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font6"> </span><span class="font8">New York in 1870 for $40,000, and that in fifty years its capitalization had become $35,-</span><span class="font6">000,000. Who shall say that the farmers ought not to have had a share of this!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another evil with which the farmers have to contend is to have their cattle sshed wAtar flu BM® </span><span class="font8">called tuberculosis test. It is claimed that many cows are ruined by the test. Furthermore, there is no proof that human beings ever get tuberculosis from drinking milk from infected cows. Anyway, the same human beings get the flesh of the infected animals at the butcher shop later; and the flesh is worse than the milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another foe of the dairy farmer is the oleomargarine maker. The profits in oleomargarine are very high and the amounts paid to stockholders and set aside for surplus by two of these companies represent a serious handicap to the legitimate butter maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But there are crooked fanners, too. The editor of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rural New Yorker</span><span class="font8"> declares that he visited </span><span class="font6">an </span><span class="font8">auction sale of fine Jersey cattle, held by </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">well-known breeder, and that at dinner he and the other guests were provided with oleomargarine wherewith to spread their bread.

<p><span class="font8">Powdered milk is now on the market. It is obtained by spraying the milk in hot air, thus drying it. Milk in this form will keep for months. Condensed milk is preserved by adding sugar to the milk before evaporation. The term Evaporated Milk is applied to the product when made by evaporating part of the ■water and preserving the residue by heating, when it is in the final container.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Butter and Butter-Making</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">M</span><span class="font8">OST people in the world have never seen any cow butter. The first butter was made long ago from the milk of the goat, reindeer, camel and yak. The Armenian dairymaid still hangs her goatskin churn by cords from </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">tripod and swings it to and fro as she did thousands of years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the West is on the move. It has found that the cow is the champion butter producer, and in the recent past has found that the cream separator leaves the old method of obtaining butter fat immeasurably in the rear. A good cream separator will lose less than two ounces of butter in 100 lbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A still more recent improvement comes from Holland, where the cream is now churned into butter in an atmosphere of pur® carbon dioxide. This fills the pores of the butter and prevents the rapid deterioration of the butter whieh is m of the plagues of the dairy business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The best butter has a waxy body, a bright appearance, and when a slab is broken shows a grain like broken steel. Overworked butter is sticky, salvy, dull and greasy in appearance, and has a gummy grain. Its keeping qualities are inferior to those of properly worked butter. Mottled butter is caused by an uneven distribution of salt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tn France, butter is protected from deterioration by glazing the surface with a coat of melted sugar, laid on with a soft brush. The process has also been introduced on a large scale in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American custom of imprinting an ornamental emblem or design on each roll or print of butter is passing away, properly so, and will soon become obsolete. That was all right when people had such a thing as leisure; but now that we are surrounded on all sides with labor-saving machinery, nobody has any time for such useless niceties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Butter made in Sweden is served in the resort hotels of Arizona, rix thousand miles away. An absolute guarantee goes with this imported butter. Scandinavia is credited with introducing butter into the rest of Europe. At one time a man’s wealth, in Scandinavia was measured by the amount of butter he owned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cheese and Cheese-Making</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are said to be eighteen main families of cheeses, with 400 species, France claims the honor of producing the first cheeses in the world, ’•hough Switzerland and other countries would contest ’he honor. But France has</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Roquefort, Camembert, Bruy ere and NeufchateL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are cheeses ripened in freshly cut hay<sub>? </sub>and. cheeses packed with hops, saffron, clover, potatoes, sage, pimiento peppers, rose leaves and marigold pleats. There are cheeses of delectable flavor but with a breath like a prohibition officer, that can be handled only after dark, and when the neighbors on both sides are out of town. Limburger! 0 boy, how bad, and yet how good I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Fiench village of Vinioutier has Just paid homage to the memory of Louise Harel, the farmer’s wife who invented the Camembert cheese. There were a brass band, a procession, a decoration of her tomb, and the affixing of a bronze tablet to the house where she made the discovery. Well! Why not? Why raise monuments to the Napoleons and other murderers and ignore those who have helped to make the world a more enjoyable place to live?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">American cheese makers are now’ imitating most of the European cheeses. They even attempt to make out of cow's milk Roquefort cheeses, which have never been made successfully except from sheep’s milk and th-i. only in the dank natural caverns in the south of France.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">How Britain Trains Her Sailors </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Ca.pt. J. C. Johnson (England)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">HpHE apprentice seaman of one hundred years ago was a child of about eight or nine years of age, uneducated and usually from a humble or poor home. He was sent to sea because some poor mother, a widow, had a hard struggle to find a crust of bread, for several small, hungry mouths. The sea offered a home and food; but no wages, unless a few odd coppers were given by the captain to get clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This small boy’s duties were numerous, the principal one being (in small vessels) to cook the food, or (in larger ocean-going vessels) to help the cook, clean the floors, and answer any call day or night from any member of the crew from captain to ordinary seaman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The period of apprenticeship was from four to seven years. After that period had been served the boy was then considered a full-fledged seaman and could command an able-bodied seaman’s wages, then about £2 a month or less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the boy had ability and resourcefulness he might be selected to take charge of a watch, and thus develop into a ship's officer; and thence some day might see him in command. Board of Trade examinations were not then demanded, as now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the advent of larger ships and Board of Trade examinations the system of apprenticeship, although little improved, demanded boys of at least fifteen or sixteen, more strength being required to handle the sails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">More than one or two boys were required, and as they cost the shipowner only food it was a cheap source of labor; hence in many of the large sailing vessels fifteen to twenty apprentices were carried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This brought into being a class of hoys whose ambition w..s to serve their apprenticeship period and toen pass the Board of Tome f mii-ination and ’hits qualify through various guides, usually for t-econd mate, then first mate, and finally niaC er.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Educated boys, from homes where parents were in comfortable eirciuusk^iees, were now entered to supply the new need for the manning of the ships, all ambitious to become officers; and the ship owners now found it expedient to no longer carry on under the old &quot;slave” system. Hence they began offering special inducements for well-to-do boys to serve apprenticeship in </span><span class="font6">their vessels. Special quarters were set apart for</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">these boys, to keep them away from the evil influences of the common sailor (Acts 10:28); and thus the boys were developed as “gentlemen sailors”. And for such privileges their parents were asked to pay a premium, varying in amount from £10 to £150, according to th© standing of the company. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This premium was a clever scheme to ensure the full service of the boys as- well as the fulfilling of the indentures. It was forfeited if not fulfilled. It vas a blind, io get seivloe fox nothing. Tako as an example one case known to the writer. Thirty guim-as v as the premium paid to the company; then in four veais of hard work the sum of onlv tv&gt; enty-eigM pounds was given, the Loy as warn s. Thus this educated boy, fi om a comfortable, v.eU-°anipped home, had the privilege of four ycais hard la^or and very scanty, poor quality food, and was also out of pocket three pounds and ten slrllings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now in return he had an endorsed indenture, qualifying him to act as able-bodied seaman, at wages of £2-5 or £2-10-0 a month, and that only during the period of employment, because upon arrival home the crews are paid off and often spend months looking about for another vessel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apprenticeship period now is four years, special privileges being given to count three years sen service to boys who have spent. £200 or £300 for a nautical education in one of the several school ships, such as the-“Worcester” or “Conway”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “Conway” lies in the river Mersey, and for a boy to enter here i<sup>f</sup> coW- a ’’GC.th <sub>s</sub>mn; and this goodly sum is im-roa-od aftor the boy haves tlm “Conv-my to qualify as an abl -bodied ssamat.

<p><span class="font8">The nocr Loy pays nothing for his schooling. After completing hh course on the ship to usually goes to sea as boy, getting a small wage; then his wages increase and he becomes an ordinary seaman. As he grows more into a young man, and becomes able to do the usual duties of an able seaman, he then signs on a# </span><span class="font6">such, and thereafter gets an able-bodied sea* </span><span class="font8">man’s scale of wages, which is meagre enough.

<p><span class="font16">E</span><span class="font8">VER since </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> began to be published I have been a tons taut and interested reader. I have marveled at the wonderful 'discoveries and progress made in the treatment of disease, as recorded in some of the articles contained therein. Surely after reading these articles one must conclude that the Golden Age is here and that man is actually returning to the days of his youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One article appeared before my astonished gaze, “A Cure for Catarrh and Hay Fever.” Here was the dream of ages fulfilled—a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">mire </span><span class="font8">for hay fever. Countless thousands have searched for relief from this dread disease only to be disappointed in their search. Millions have been made through advertising cures for this affliction, only to have its victims spend their money in vain. - As “liope springs eternal in the human bieast”, so the poor victims after getting stung on one thing aie just as eager to try the next thing that comes along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I too have been a victim for fifteen years or more and luxe tried everything I have ever heard of, and they have been Iwrion. I have been connected with the medicine men of the country and am learned in their art of witchcraft, but had concluded after years of experience that the less one has to do with their charms and powders the better off one is. Yes, I have tried Iheir pills, their ointments and lotions, their serums and their cigarettes, but only t© find that the more I used the worse I got. Then I turned to the Golden Age innovations, such as chiropractic and electronic treatments, only to meet with the same result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But now I find in </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Th® Gowen Age</span><span class="font6"> a CURE, and it must be so because a contributor to </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> says so. Surely it must cost a lot </span><span class="font8">of money; but no, on investigating I find thal all it costs is an invesnnent of one thin dime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shall I try it? “Hope springs eternal,” so here goes. I buy an ounce of powdered bayberry bark, which </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Gowen Age</span><span class="font8"> tells me to get and sniff up my nose several times a day to get rid of my hay fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How many hundred pounds of the stuff have I used to help manufacture a concoction for others to use, and all I thought that it was good for was to get their money! Yet I take tins precious recipe home to try, meditating on the joy I would get out of life when the hay fever season comes on. Surely this is no idle dream, because I saw it in </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As soon as I arrive I quickly take a generous pinch of the bayberry for my first plunge into the unknown, and eagerly I place it up my nostrils and give a vigorous sniff. Ouch! Helpll Murder!'! What has happened? Did a mule kick me on the beezer or was I merely electro-cured? Anyway, all the constellations of 1119 heavens quickly pass before my raptured gaze. My hair seems to have jumped off my scalp. I catch my breath; and then I discover that X have simply had a whole season of hay fever crowded into a few brief minutes. Torrents of ' water pour from my nose and eyes. I am blinded. Shall I over recover? After a while I begin to realize that I as still alive. Then I begin to return to normalcy once mor®.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a beautiful, treatment! Only to b® re* peated several times a day for at least two months. Shall I do it? Well, no mul© ever kicked me and got away with it, so I do not think a little </span><span class="font6">powdered bayberry bark ©an put me out of the running. So here goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the end of the first month I find that I can</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">take the dose without having eyes and nose run wild. By the end of the second month the mucous membrane of my nose gets case-hardened to such an extent that the bayberry does not bother me. But the hay fever season is still a month away, so I continue to keep up the treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At last the fateful hour arrives. August 15th Is here. To sneeze or not to sneeze—which ©hall it be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ah’, in my mind’s eye I can see his Satanic Majesty getting ready to shake the ragweed and blow its pollen into the air to torture mankind once more. What a suspense! August 15,16,17,18,19. 20, and still no sneeze. Hurrah! it is gone I Something is strangely missing in my young life. The old stand-by that has been with me so many years to break up the monotony of late summer and early autumn life is no more. No longer can I pull a towel, sheet or tablecloth out of my pocket and mop up that never-ending stream, flowing from my nasal well-springs, and get a wicked laugh from those who see me. No longer will I have that awful look of misery upon my face, with the tears running out of my eyes and my friends glee-fully asking me what I am crying for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oh, how we hay fever victims like to see others laugh at our tearful sighing and crying I But 1 am serious—-just think how much joy is going to be token from others, just because I invested ten cents for some hayberry bark. But then—-oh, well, such is life; its just one thing after another, with r<sup>!i</sup>e first hundred years the hardest And after taut you begin to get used to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">August 21st, Ah-ca-choo! IVLat was that? ITalse alarm, for that was the only one that showed up. I almost thought it was my friend back again. But no such luck, no sir; I had used bayberry bark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">August 28th. What a beautiful day! It is nice and waim, the air is dry, and the zephyrs from the west are playfully passing over the beautiful patches of ragweed. Ah-ca-choo, ea-choo, and a dozen more of them. How come? By noon I have as beautiful an attack of hay fever as I have ever had in my life. Ah, shucks! Stung again! Barnum was right. But there is one consolation, it cost me only ten cents this</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Well, now, I can look forward to basking in flie pleasures of Dante’s “Inferno” for a month or more. Say, I’ll bet that when that bird wrote that piece he was either under the influence of demons or had hay fever—with a safe bet that he was merely trying to describe his feelings from the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No. the Golden Age of prophecy is not established yet. Neither has man, returned to the days of his youth. But, thank God, we can still see by the eye of faith that the time is not far distant when mankind will be relieved from its Buffering, and will not need to rely upon such inadequate remedies and pass through such experiences as I have undergone to find relief. Surely the “Sun of righteousness&quot; is now rising with healing in his beams, and goon the world will feel the results of the Lord’s kingdom -ow being set up in the earth. “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, even as it is in heaven.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[Radiopswt from Station WBBR on a wave length of 416.4 meters by F. W. Franz.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">G</span><span class="font6">OD has His priests. The Devil also has his priests. Only priests appointed by the true God and obeying God’s rules for them are^gen-uine and true. All others who call themselves priests—be they heathen, pagan or so-called Christian—are bogus priests, and their services do not count worth a penny toward gaining favor with God and eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many posing as priests before the people today take themselves very seriously. They claim the exclusive right to make marriages valid, to bless burial grounds, to make holy water, to sanctify war, to bless armies and navies and their weapons of manslaughter, to anoint kings, to baptize, and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For instance, the papers recently told of a &lt;&nbsp;happening in connection with the closing of certain churches in Mexico. Crowds thronged a particular church in Mexico City to have a certain religious rite performed. A tearful mother, hugging a baby to her bosom, fought her way through the crowd, to get ahead of the others. What was the cause of her distress? We will let the Los Angeles </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> tell the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Father, you must baptize my baby,” the mother pleaded frantically. . . . The priest replied that the woman must await her turn. “I cannot wait,” wailed the woman. “I wish I could wait; I wish death would wait—but it will not. My baby is dying!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why this frantic rush on the part of this woman? You know. The priest had led her to believe that if her bhby died before he sprinkled a few drops of water in its face something terrible would happen to it at death—the helpless little innocent would go to eternal torture in a lake of fire and brimstone! With a sigh of relief many read that the baby was baptized “in the nick of time”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But, we ask, would that infant have been lost if not baptized in time? Did the priest’s performing the ceremony make the baptism valid? If not, what was the use of the mother’s rushing to the priest to have him do the service under such critical circumstances? Suppose he was not a real priest of God, then what about the fate of the child even though baptized? All of this makes us press the question more earnestly: Who are God’s true priesthood, and What is their appointed work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In treating this question it is eminently proper that we take the holy Scriptures, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the Bible, as </span><span class="font6">our authority; because Jesus said that it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Word of God; and God’s Word is truth. Since this question treats of priests, we shall quote ail supporting Scripture references exclusively from an edition of the Bible published on Barclay Street, New York City, which has </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">cross on the front and back covers and has the approval of a priest, the Archbishop of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s True Priests Not Ordained by Men</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">PRIEST of God is one who is ordained not by men but by God, to intercede for sinners out of harmony with God and to offer sacrifice for their sins so as to bring about their recon-cilliation with God. All mankind needs such a priest. Why? Because God is holy; He cannot approve of sin or deal directly with sinners, but must have some one acceptable and approved to intervene between Him and sinners. And our first father, Adam, sinned against God and plunged all of his offspring into sin and its consequences ; namely, alienation from God, imperfection, misery, sickness, and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Romans 6:23 we read, “The wages of sin is death.” Hence all are dying. What man needs, and wants at heart, is not to go to heaven but to enjoy true human happiness on earth by being restored to his original standing as a son of God, becoming perfect as a human being, free from sin and all its effects, and blessed with life in its perfection. Now the priest or priests whose services to God for man can bring about this desired condition would be God’s priesthood in a true sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first priest mentioned in the Bible is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">man by the name of Melchizedek. Abraham, the Hebrew, met him after he had succeeded in rescuing his nephew Lot from marauding kings. Of him we read, in Genesis 14:18,19: “But Melchizedek the king of Salem, bringing forth bread and wine, for he was the priest of the most high God, blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram by the most high God.” It is important to bear this man Melchizedek in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second priest mentioned is Potiphar, who was an Egyptian priest at Heliopolis or On. The third priest brought to our attention in the Scriptures is Raguel, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">priest of Midian </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Midian. Neither of these two men ministered to the true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Jewish Priesthood</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font6">HE fourth priest mentioned in the Bible is Aaron. He was a Jew, the brother of Moses, ■ and belonged to the tribe of Levi. He did not seek the priestly office for himself. No, but the Apostle Paul writes: “Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.” Aaron went to no theological seminary for seven or more years to win the honor of becoming a priest. The book of Exodus, chapter 28, verse 1, states that God said unto Moses: “Take unto thee also Aaron thy brother with his sons from the children of Israel, that they may minister to me in the priest’s office.” Thus Aaron was called of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God ordained that only those who were the descendants of Aaron could be priests. But for whom were Aaron and his descendants to be priests? For all mankind? No! it was only for the Jews that they offered sacrifices for sin. Jehovah God had separated the Jews from all other nations of earth to be His chosen people; and it was for them that He established a priesthood in the family of Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However we ask, Did the sacrifices which Aaron and his priestly successors offered take away the sins of the Jewish people? The Apostle Paul settles this question also. It must be remembered that the sacrifices offered on the Jewish altar were animals, and sometimes birds. Once a year, on the 10th day of the 7th month of the Jewish year, the day of national atonement for sins was held. On that occasion the high priest, unattended, went into the most holy sanctuary of the temple. There he sprinkled the blood, first of a bullock and later of a goat, upon the golden mercy seat. This atonement sacrifice had to be repeated yearly. Why? Because those animal sacrifices could not take away human sins. Why not? In Hebrews, - chapter 10, verse 4, the apostle answers: “For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sins should be taken away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Its Typical Significance</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font6">HY then did Jehovah God set up this Jewish priesthood if its ministry did not truly purge away sin ? In Galatians 3: 24 we read: “Wherefore the law was our pedagogue [schoolmaster, conductor] in Christ.” In other words, the law of Moses and its arrangements regarding the priesthood were to serve as picture il- . lustrations of things pertaining to Jesus </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ; </span><span class="font6">and His true followers. The law also served to show us that no man who traces descent from ' the sinner Adam can gain eternal life by trying to keep the ten commandments, or by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">deeds </span><span class="font6">of penance or by offering animal sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However the fact that animals were killed and that their blood was shed and used, in sprinkling the mercy seat served to picture something; namely, that there must be the death of an acceptable sacrificial Victim and the shedding of His blood in order for man’s sins to be actually purged away. The apostle speaks to . the point when in Hebrews 9: 22 he states: “Almost all things, according to the [Jewish] law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For mankind’s sin the shedding of bloodmust be that of a human being. Why? The Bible explains in Leviticus 17: II, where God says: “The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you, that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your souls, and the blood may be for an ^piation of the soul.” Now it was human life that Adam sinned away, and this life was represented by his blood. According to God’s law Adam’s original perfection was based upon or consisted in his pure and perfectly healthy blood that coursed through his. body. After he had sinned and was driven out of -the garden of Eden and away from its perfect food, his blood stream became impure and diseased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Miraculous Priesthood Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IN </span><span class="font6">DEUTERONOMY 19:21 God’s law de-dares: “Thou . . . shalt require life fdr life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.” In other words, like must go for like. Adam as a perfect man had sinned and had thereby lost his right to human life. Logically, in order for Adam to be released from the death sentence and to live again, not in heaven but as a human being on earth, another perfect man must shed his blood; that is, must give up his flesh and blood life for Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">None of Adam’s children are perfect; all are defiled through his sin. Hence none of them could pay the ransom for Adam or any other human being,, as is stated in Psalm 48:8: “No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: he </span><span class="font8">shall not give to God his ransom.” None on earth could be found with blood pure enough, to shed. Hence the necessity of a miraculous Savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This Savior proved to be' Jesus. He was miraculously born from the virgin. Mary by the power or spirit of God, and by this process His life was transferred from heaven to earth. Thus He was the Sen of God and not the son of the sinful Adam. No human father had begotten him; consequently he was pure from the sins and imperfections of Adam. He had been a holy and undefiled Son of God in heaven before He became the perfect man Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here then in Jesus Christ was the One who could serve as a priest for all mankind, being able to offer a sacrifice that would indeed take away or cancel their sins. But how could Jesus become a priest among the Jews, seeing that He was of the tribe of Judah and not of the priestly family of Aaron? He could not; in fact, He did not. His priesthood is broader than that. He came to make atonement not merely for the sins of the Jews but for the sins of all mankind. So it is written in Hebrews 2:9: “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that through the grace of God he might taste death for all?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Who Made Jesus Priest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HO made Jesus Priest! Did the Jewish high priest or any other man lay his hands on Jesus’ head and ordain Him. Priest! Or did Jesus elect Himself Priest? No, for Hebrews 5:5 answers: “So Christ also did not glorify himself that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How was this? Ah, Jesus did not join any church, but at His legal majority, thirty years, He devoted Himself to Jehovah God in full consecration; and God thereupon anointed Him with Ills holy spirit or power. Thus God ordained Jesus a High Priest. as such He was to offer up His own human life as a ransom sacrifice for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since Jesus was not a priest of the family of Aaron, to what order of priesthood did He or goes He belong! Hebrews 7:17 replies: &quot;Tor fee [God] testifieth; Thou art a priest for </span><span class="font8">according to the order of Melchizedek.<sup>8</sup>* Ah, now we see: Melchizedek, the ancient, was a picture or type of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">as Melchizedek was said to be without father or mother, so Jesus was without father bt mother in the priesthood; He did not inherit Hi® office of Priest from any earthly parent. as Melchizedek was said to be without beginning of days or end of life, so with Jesus. True, Jesus says that He is &quot;the beginning of the creation of God” (Apocalypse 3:14), but no man knows when He as the Logos was created. Likewise, sinee His resurrection from the dead He has no end of life, for He says of Himself: “Behold, I am living for ever and ever?’ (Apocalypse 1:18) rs Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem, so Jesus Christ has now been made &quot;King of kings and Lord of lords”, and as such He will reign over earth for a thousand years. as Melchizedek was priest of the most high God, so Jesus has been called of God a Priest for ever according to the order of Melchizedek. He offered the perfect and acceptable sacrifice to Jehovah for sins, and during His Millennial reign He will bless all mankind with the benefits of His sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus it is clear that at Jesus’ death the Jewish priesthood became out of date, its services no longer being required. Therefore God changed the priesthood. Hebrews 7:12,18 states: &quot;For the priesthood being translated [changed], . . . there is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus the Head</span><span class="font6"> of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the Order of Priests</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font8">INCE Jesus is the first or the head of the order of Melchizedek, He is the High Priest or Chief Priest thereof. In confirmation of this Hebrews 3:1 says: “Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.” There must be, then, an under priesthood. The Apostle Peter bears out this thought, for in his first epistle, chapter 2, verse 5 and 9, he writes; “Be ye also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood. , . . You are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">holy nation, a purchased people?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who is this priesthood? To this I can imagine many radio listeners saying, Why, our clergy </span><span class="font8">of course! Is not the head of our church called by various priestly titles, such as, “Holy Father of Fathers,&quot; “High Priest, Supreme Bishop,” “Head of all the Holy Priests of God,” “Sovereign Priest,” “Melchizedek in Order,” and so on?

<p><span class="font8">Did the apostles lay their hands on other men’s heads to make them priests? Where is there a record of even the Apostle Peter having done so? The-re is none in the Scriptures. In the B iok of Acts, chapter 6, verse 6, there is </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">record of the apostles’ laying riieir hands on the heads of seven men whom the congregation at Jerusalem had selected to serve as deacons; and in the Book of Acts, chapter 13, there is a record of where the Christian congregation at Antioch—none of the twelve apostles being present at the time, however—Mid their hands on the heads of Barnabas and Saul to send them forth as missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But where is there a Bible record of a Christian priest being thus ordained I T alltnge any one, of any ehweh denomination, to find one Scripture proof! Ratbr, in Galatians 1; J<sub>s </sub>the wuter says: “Paul an apostle not of men, neither by man, by Jesus Christ, and God the Father&quot;; and I renu id vou aurin that in Hebrews 5:4 it says: “Neither does any man take the honour to himseh, hut ho that is called by God, as Aaron v,as.“</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If no man can take this honor to himself, how then can any man or cioup of men assign the honor of the priesthood to any other man by laying hands upon his head? It cannot be done according to the holy scriptures of the Bible; it is only God that ordains priests through Jesus Christ, and the Scriptures show that He does aot use men to do the ordairing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Jewish high priests had to offer sacrifices year by year, because their animal sacrifices did not really take avay sins. &quot;Would you make Jesus’ perfect and complete sacrifice as of little value a*? these Jewish sacrifices, by saying that it has to be repeated daily f Ah no, Christ Jesus’ one sacrifice suffices for ever. He dies no more as a sacrifice, not even, on church altars^ because in Romans, chapter 6, verse 9, it is ‘written: “Christ rising again from the dead dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, if you argue that Jesus is offered up in unbloody sacrifice on your church altars, it again proves that the mass is utterly valueless, because the scripture verse previously quoted says: “Without shedding of blood there is no remission.” Thus the scriptures make the divine truth stand forth grandly, that Jesus offered Himself once for all; His sacrifice cannot be repeated, neither does it need renewal or repetition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everyone who is honest with himself, and who wants to be in harmony with God's Word —-even though it makes men liars—will agiee to this, namely, that a priesthood elanning to offer the sacrifice of Christ afresh is V’'scriptural; it cannot be God’s true priesthood; such a priesthood is committing blasphemy and abomination.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">IIO then compose God’s true priesthood under the High Priest, Christ Jesus? Not clergymen of any denomination—no; but plain, ordinary, humble, genuine Christians. It was to such that the Apostle Peter wrote, when he said: “Be ye built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood. ... Ye are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood.” It was to such that the Apostle Paul wrote, saying: “Wherefore, holy brethren, . . . consider the . . . high priest of our confession Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God’s true priests cannot be detected by the kind of clothing they wear, by wearing their ©ollars and thrir vests backward, by wearing a skirt, a mitre, cope, alb, biretta, cowl, surplice, eassock, scapular, ring, pectoral cross, crozier or rosary. Jesus never wore these unusual vestments and regalia, and Jesus Himself said that the. disciple is not above his Master. The first epistle of Peter, chapter 2, verse 21, says: ^Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow hto stops.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Have ijot ilion those professing to be priests today gotten far away from the example of Jesus? For an answer hear the voice of sacred scripture. In the piopheeies of Hosea, Jeremiah, and Micah the unfaithful and false priesthood is described in these words: “From the prophet </span><span class="font6">even unto the priest every on&lt; </span><span class="font8">dealeth falsely. . . . The </span><span class="font6">priests thereof teach </span><span class="font8">for hire, and the prophets thereof divine </span><span class="font6">for </span><span class="font8">money. . . , Because thou hast rejected knowk edge, I will also reject thee, that thou shall </span><span class="font6">be </span><span class="font8">no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font8">law of thy God.” Now, do you listeners-in know of any class of men calling themselves priests who teach for hire and money, and who teach, catechism and church creeds instead of the true law of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, in Malaehias 2:7 the Lord says: “For the lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek tl e law at his mouth: because he is ih« an&lt;;el of the Lord of hosts.&quot; It follows flion that if a man called a priest does not teach the knowledge of the Livr of God, which is the Bible, he is not a priest of the Lord. Now, do 3’ou know of any who parade as priests and yet who do not teach th© Bible and who either forbid the people to have the Bible or who do not encourage the people's having the Bible ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Consider one more scripture, namely, Hosea 6:9, which reads: “Like the jaws of highway robbers, they conspire with the priests who murder in the way those that pass . . . for they have -wrought -wickedness.” Now do you know of any set of men, called priests, who during the middle ages had fifty million heretics (as they called them) murdered by the Spanish inquisition, by so-called “holy crusades”, by massacres such as the massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day, by burning at the stake, and by other shameful and violent moans ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">What the True Priests Saenhee</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270126_files/g_E_19270126-17.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">HOSE who are true disciples of Jesus Christ do not do these xm-Christlike things. They have consecrated themselves wholly to God to do His will. Psalm 50: 2 speaks of them as having made a covenant with Jehovah God by sacrifice, thereafter to lead a sacrificial life as Jesus did, renouncing earth, and aspiring to serve the Lord for ever in the heovens. Hence Jehovah God recognizes them as His true priests under Christ Jesus as their High Priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These faithful ones appreciate that the sacrifice of Jesus needs no repetition in the form of the mass or any ether form; they know that they are not appointed to offer up the sacrifice of the body and blood ©f Jesus Ghrisi, but they</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jollow the instructions of God’s apostle, in Romans 12:1, which read: “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies [not Christ’s body, they cannot do that] a living-sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are the ones whom God (and not man) has anointed with His spirit and thereby ordained them as members of the kingly priesthood after the order of Melchizedek as it is written in the Apocalypse, chapter 1, verse 7: “And [thou] hast made us a kingdom and priests to God and his Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to God’s appointment they must walk in the way of sacrifice and Christ-like service down here on. earth, not seeking earthly honors and wealth and power. If faithful unto death, they shall be raised up out of death in the first resurrection and inherit the heavenly kingdom, and there sit with Jesus on the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So we read in the Apoealyps®, chapter 20, vers® 6: “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in ths first resurrection: in these the second death hath no power: but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the kingdom they will be joined with the divine Jesus, their High Priest. There with Him they will be associated in mediating before God for mankind, to bring back all the willing and obedient ones of mankind into harmony with God. as priests they will bless the people, whether living or dead—for the dead shall be restored from the graves—by dispensing to them all the blessings which were provided for them by the perfect sacrifice of Jesus, God’s true High Priest, who “gave himself a ransom for all”. These blessings will be life, liberty, peace and eternal happiness in Paradise restored on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> The prisoners here mentioned are the God-believing multitudes who are restrained through &quot;a &gt;ri t wous enuirib stems, both Catholic 01 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'I</span><span class="font8"> Prctfe-’tant, A prisoner may be held as such by obw things than stone Avails and steel hors. The creeds have emphasized the thought that the only gateway to heaven is church membership. The clergy have taught hell and purgatory for non-church members. Thousands are held in the churches today for social standing and for commercial reasons. It is a known fact that the preachers know very little about the Bible today, and their flocks are in darkness concerning the Bible truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prophet of the Lord says to the Christian, and this is one of the messages we now declare, &quot;Say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves.” There is no doubt in my mind but that the Lord has provided the radio so that the message might get to these prisoners who are afraid to come out in public and be seen but who nevertheless like the truth. To all such wo now have the privilege of saying, Come out of these systems and churches where the truth is no longer preached; make a firm stand for the Lord, and let others know that you are on the Lord’s side. In Revelation 18:4 we read, &quot;Come out of her, my people, that ye be not panakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Please explain the text John 10: 1, &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entoreth not by the door into the sheepfold, but elimbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> Jesus was hero teaching that He, Himself, was the door into God’s- organization. In verse seven of the same chapter Jtsus said, 'Verily, verily. I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.” The scribes end Pharisees, the religionists of Jesus’ day, had been teaching the people that they wore the way They Gai med m be the only expounders and intei nrefors of the Scriptures. Lut Jesus said ccncc’nirg them, &quot;AU that ever came before me are thy ve» and robbers: hut the -sheep did not kw riwm I am the door: by me if any man imei in, he shell be saved, and riirll go io and out. and find pasture. The thie* cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and tliM they might have it more abundantly.” The scribes and 1’harisees were notorious for collection of money in the name of religion, and anyone who makes such a practise is an abomination ia the sight of the </span><span class="font6">Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question</span><span class="font8"> : Please explain John 15:8, &quot;Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit f so shall ye be my disciples.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> The fruit here mentioned </span><span class="font6">is not </span><span class="font8">&quot;character development”, nor the gathering </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font8">an abundance of money and vast estates—</span><span class="font6">no; </span><span class="font8">but it is the speaking and doing of those </span><span class="font6">things </span><span class="font8">that </span><span class="font6">are a </span><span class="font8">praise to Jehovah God. Making known the fact that Jehovah is the true God, and that His kingdom will redound to the blessing of all mankind is a praise to the name </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font8">the Lord. We will note that Jesus said that &quot;herein is my Father glorified”. Certainly </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font8">Lord could not be glorified by anything prompted by selfishness. In 1 Peter 2: 9 we read, “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” Jesus sought ever to honor His Father, and the disciple of Jesus should do likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Please explain John 17:9,10, &quot;I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> Jesus prayed for those who were devoted to His Father. This did not mean that He had no love for other people. He knew that His followers are now on trial, that they are being tested as to loyalty to the heavenly Father, and that they above all people need the prayers of any other person who is in harmony with the Lord. The Master knew well that the world of mankind in general was under the in-</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sl&amp;vco</span><span class="font8"> of the Dev J. and thrl later on, in Hie kingdom, when Satan would be bound, trie people of the world will learn righteousness and rejmef in the ways of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Vaster prayed for them whom the he«v« only Father h<sub>t</sub>d gh ui. He said, All mine are thine,’ show ng a mutial interest in those who are devoted to Jehovah Ged. by the expression, *I am glorified in them,” we understand that Christ’s followers a-a an honor to Jehovah God nad &quot;bo to Christ Jesus. It is important, therefore. that the Christian seek to honor Jehovah Qod above all, and this is done by following in the footsteps of the Master.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">There have been some leaders in times past, and there are some now, who are genuinely interested unselfishly in the welfare of the common people; and in an endeavor to better conditions these have tried various remedies. Colleges have been endowed by wealthy men to aid in educating the people to better things; while uplift and reform movements beyond number have been started. Various schemes in the way of legislation, changes of government, equity leagues, councils, etc., have been tried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But now all realiw that all the social, financial, political and ecclesiastical systems have fallen far short and have failed to bring satisfaction to the people. Doubt, fear, perplexity, and distress have a hold on the people. The Philadelphia </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ledger</span><span class="font8"> well sums up the present situation in the following item:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The war was followed by a six-year purgatory that still endures. The Hanse of Hapsburg has gons. So have the House of Hohenzollem and the Glucksburg* of Greece. The Romanoffs have passed to their obscure graves and the dust of a dead empire. Europe’s map has changed. New little states struggle for life in tha war wreckage that covers more than 10,000,000 fighting men’s graves. In part Europe is a world of phantom cities, ghostly villages and the wraiths of men and the life of yesterday. The eruption that shook the world, has ended; but the crust forming over the lava bods of haie and fear is very thin, and the fires underneath cool slowly. The stability of this remade world is uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The People Want Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">fTTHE common people want peace and hate war, yet in all the principal countries preparations are being made for war on a far greater and more deadly scale than ever before in history. The money of the common people, paid in the form of taxes, is being used to search out more poisonous and deadly forms of gas for the destruction of cities and defenceless people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Scientists, college professors and others ar® using their learning and skill not in the furtherance and development of the best interests of the people along scientific or medical lines but in preparation of new means of destruction— forming weapons of ruthlessness and hate. It is not surprising that the people no longer look forward with hope and confidence, but with fear and anxiety for the things they see in. preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The climax is here. Man has reached his extremity, and the time is ripe for a real standard to be raised; one that will lead the people in the way that they should go and to the opportunity for peace, prosperity, life, liberty, health, and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is apparent to all that the power of the great Creator of the universe could not have been behind the various standards that have been raised in the past, which have been, followed but which have failed and have brought about the present distressing conditions and unhappy prospects. The very cause of their failure is because they were not Jehovah's standard and were not in harmony with the way His Word points out as the only way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For six thousand years, since Adam in the garden of Eden turned away from God’s way at the leading of Lucifer, Jehovah has permitted mankind to wallow about under the cruel dominion of this same Lucifer, otherwise called Satan, “the god of this world.” (2 Corinthians 4:4) During this time Jehovah has endured the efforts of Satan to turn men's minds away from Him, and has stood the slurs cast Upon His name by the Devil’s promulgation of such false doctrines as the trinity, hell-fire, immortality of the soul, infant baptism, and other blasphemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Long centuries ago, however, through the inspired prophets of old, Jehovah repealed that it veas His purpose that when His due time should come He would arise and smite the adversary, the Devil, and put him out of the way; and that then He would raise a true standard which would lead the people to Himself and to life and 'happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Through, the Prophet David, in the second Psalm, the Lord Jehovah, knowing the end from the beginning, shows how the heathen would rage and. the people imagine vain schemes, and horv the kings would set themselves and the rulers would take counsel together against the Lord and ag’ainst His anointed; then He shows how He, Jehovah, sitting in the heavens, would laugh and hold them in derision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Through the Prophet Isaiah, in the forty-third chapter and the ninth verse, Jehovah gpoke specifically of the present time of world conferences, leagues, world courts, federations, etc.. and challenged the nations to gather together and the people to assemble themselves, that they might bring’ forth their witnesses, their spokesmen, and justify their course or prove the propriety of their standards; and, failing so </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font8">do, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font8"> hear His message and to admit that it </span><span class="font6">Is TRUTH!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the tenth verse of the same chapter we read these words of Jehovah’s given through the Prophet Isaiah: “That ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I have declared, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font8">have saved, and I have shewed. ... Yea, before the day was I am he; and. there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work </span><span class="font6">and who shall turn it back!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">God N&amp;t the Author of Emi</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">fFHE catastrophes, wars and sorrows of ths past six thousand years did not occur because of lack of power on the part of Jehovah to control earth’s affairs but are directly traceable to the common enemy of the people, Satan. However, in 1914 the period of dominion of the Gentile kings in the earth ended, and Satan’s dominion as overlord of these governments </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">lik</span><span class="font8">e-, wise ended. The time had come for the long-prayed-for kingdom of God to be established on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus Christ who, because of His obedience even unto death, had been resurrected from the grave by Jehovah and given all power in heaven and earth, had been sitting at the right hand of Jehovah on high, according to the 110th Psalm and Hebrews 10:13, awaiting the expiration of the Gentile dominion before beginning to exercise His power in the earth. The prophecies of the 12th chapter of Revelation, and also the 12th chapter of Daniel, show how Christ. Jesus, as Michael the representative of Jehovah, would then assume his power and proceed against the adversary, the Devil, and east him and his angels out of heaven into the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The 12th chapter of Revelation, corroborated by physical facts, shows that this took place between 1914 and 1918; and that the Devil, upon, finding himself cast out of heaven and it for ever closed to his schemes, organized his forces to raise havoc in the earth. The Revelator expresses it in this wise: “Woe to the earth and the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath!” This is the real reason for the increase of crime following the war, the breaking down of former barriers of restraint, the prohibition evil and its consequences through poisoned liquor, and the devilish preparations for warfare by poison gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The True Standard</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">UT let the people take courage—for the inspired writer of old, Isaiah, in his prophecy of the 59th chapter and the 19th verse, states that when the enemy shall come in like a flood then shall the spirit of the Lord raise </span><span class="font6">up a </span><span class="font8">standard against him! Now the enemy is in the earth like a flood, and now the forces of righteousness under Christ Jesus, the represen</span><span class="font6">tative of the Most High God, are turned against him. Now </span><span class="font8">the kings of the earth and the whole world are being gathered to the groat battle of the day of the Lord God Almighty; now the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God is being trod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The outcome has never been in doubt. -The 19th and 20th chapters of Revelation show how the forces of righteousness, led by the Faithful and True, will put to rout the force of evil in this great battle of Armageddon, and how the angel of the Lord will bind the old Serpent, the Devil, for a thousand years, that he may deceive the nations no more until the thousand years are done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then in the 21st chapter the inspiied Rev-elator describes the new heavens and new earth, and how the people shall then be blessed; how God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and how there shall be &quot;no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things will have passed away”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now the standard of the Lord God Almighty is being unfurled in the sight of the people. Now the limitless powers of the Creator of the universe are being loosed against the deceivers of the people, to the removing of the false standards that have led to sorrow and death. Now the command is given to the Christian, through the Prophet Isaiah in the 62nd chapter and tenth verse of his prophecy, “Go through! Go through the gates! Prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The wonderful message for the people now is that Jehovah is the only true and living God, beside whom there is none, Jie is the Creator of the heav ans and earth. Ue it was who erected man and gave him life. It na? Jehovah who took life way. It was Jehovah, who provided t.l-e way Ihor man may get life, Jehovah provided the earth for man to live vron in happiness. Jehovah h&gt; s done all thm, not f •= selfish purposes hut out of His great, love fur Jdtis creatures. He is the, true and unchanging Friend of&quot; the people, and imw the time has arrived for the people to learn and appreciate this truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The truth about Jesus Christ must now be made known to the people; that He is the beloved Son of God; that by His death and resurrection Ho provided the great redemptive price for man; that all power in heaven and earth was committed to Him by Jehovah; that He is the King of kings and Lord of lords., and that now the time has come for Him to exercise His rightful power and reign; that now He is prospering against the deceiver of the people, Satan, and will destroy all his wicked systems and restrain him —1 John 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people must learn that now the kingdom of heaven, God’s kingdom, is here; that ths rightful King of earth has begun His reign; that now all the things that have stumbled the people and kept them from a knowledge of the truth about Jehovah and His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, are being removed, that the people may be pointed to the only way that leads to life and happiness. Now the people must forsake the following of false standards that have brought unhappiness, and rally to the standard of Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Beginning of Wisdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE wise man, in Proverbs 1:7, points out that ‘reverence for the Lord is the beginning of wisdom’. And the Psalmist says (Psalm 25:14), ‘The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him and his covenant, to make them know it.’ The people must begin to learn the truth concerning Jehovah God, their Creator, and His plan. The Word of Truth, the Bible, is the standard which sets forth the truth about Jehovah, and about Jesus Christ whom Jehovah provided as our Redeemer; and to make progress over the way that loads to life and happiness it is essential that the people turn to this standard and apply their minds to an understanding of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you would learn of the way to life, turn to the thirty-fifth chapter of Isaiah and the eighth verse, which, reads: “And an highway shall be there, and. a way, and it shall 1% caPrd, The way of holiness; the unclean shell not pass over it; out it shall be for those : the uayfawng men, though fools, shell not err Ikira.” This way is called Holy highway.uae it is Jehovah's way, and everything with Him is holy. The unclean shall not pass over if. All who come over this way are umlean; but by obeying tbs juJes of the Lord they shall make progress ever the w«y and be cleaned up by the time they reach the end of the way, which ends not in death but in life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Also turn to the fifty-fifth chapter of Isaiah and the first verse, and there read the gracious invitation of the Lord, “Ho, every one that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">28»\. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price.” In times past the preachers have thought they had a corner on religion and have made the people pay for it; but now the Lord invites, yea, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">broadcasts</span><span class="font6"> the invitation, “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye . . . without money, and without price!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Howl, Ye Shepherds”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">C</span><span class="font6">ONCERNING these false shepherds of the people, who have allied themselves with the politicians and profiteers, the prophet of the Lord writes, in Jeremiah 25:34-36, “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and afri howl</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">of the principal of the flock, shall be heard; for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the standard is held before the people,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• U. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'■'&amp;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">that all who have an honest and sincere desire to know the truth and to travel over the way to life, may do so. Now the promise of Zephaniah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">2:2,3 may be claimed: “Before the decree come forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">High above the false standards and messages Of the Devil and his organized arrangements in the earth, the standard of the eternal God is now being flung. Let all honest people who desire to see peace and happiness in the earth, follow this standard. It will guide them to life and liberty, and to a knowledge of their Maker. To them the Lord will turn a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord and worship Him with one consent. And through the Prophet Isaiah the Lord graciously says: “And it shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are' yet speaking, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">will hear.”—Isaiah 65:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>684</sup> The Psalmist gives us another picture of this kingdom of blessing, saying, “The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.” (Psalm 50:1) The earth here represents the new organized government. The rising of the. sun means the beginning of the Messianic reign; while its going down pictures the completion of that reign. Therefore, throughout the whole Millennial reign the Lord will be calling to the peoples of earth to come into this valley of blessing and receive life, peace, and happiness. “He shall call to the heavens [the spiritual, invisible part of the kingdom] from above, and to the earth [the new organized government], that he may judge his people.” (Psalm 50:4) To judge means to give opportunity for blessings by means of a trial; and this is in harmony -with the other statements of the Scriptures that every one must have a fair trial fordife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>586</sup> The first few years of restitution blessings will find multitudes of people diligently seeking to be restored to health and strength; and as they grow strong themselves and prepare homes for themselves and their families, they will be thinking of their beloved dead. Naturally they will want to see them again, and they will pray to the Lord to restore them. And the Lord will hear their prayers and answer them. “It shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.” (Isaiah 65:24) Jesus declared that “all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, un</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment”. (John 5:28,29) “They that have done evil” here means the entire human race aside from the church. They were born evil, born sinners. (Romans-5:12) They are coming forth to judgment, to a trial; and this is the great trial time spoken of by the apostle, in which all men shall have an opportunity. (Acts 17: 31) “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">unjust.”—Acts 24:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>586</sup> St. Paul then produces his wonderful </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">beautiful argument on the resurrection, saying, “If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised; and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in yoiyr sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in , this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:1622) Then the apostle shows that after the resurrection of the church in the beginning of the kingdom every man must come forth in his own order. Jesus declared: “Many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.” (Matthew 19:30) This principle may be properly applied to the resurrection of the dead. Those who died last will be the first to be awakened; while those who died centuries ago will be among the last to be awakened.</span></p>
