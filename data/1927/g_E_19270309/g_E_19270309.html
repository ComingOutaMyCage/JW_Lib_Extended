<p><span class="font11">America’s Greatest lachistry</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font5">T WOULD hardly be necessary to tell any one who lives in America that the greatest in-dxxotiy of this country is the automobile industry. The evidences of it. are on every hand. It seems a good time to take a glance at. this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1741 Solomon de Coste of Normandy wrote a book, in which he endeavored to show that it would be possible to propel carriages bv steam power. Me thus backed up the prognostications ©f the mediaeval monk, Boger Bacon, who foresaw a time coming when “we shall be able to propel carriages with incredible speed, without the assistance of any animal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But de Coste lived in an evil time; and because Cardinal Richelieu had never seen an automobile, and did not think such a device was possible, and perhaps did not think that it was desirable, he used his gentle influence with the authorities and had poor de Coste put. into a madhouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But others in France, in a later day, took up de Coste’s idea; and there is now, at Le Mans, France, in the magnificent stable on the estate of Marquis de Broc, a steam-propelled stage mid bmlt in J 878 at enormous expense, which made long trips at a speed of about 28 miles </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ei</span><span class="font5"> hour. Tue coach had a powerful engine in f ■■out and chimney in the roar. The Marquis dis-« litinuU infiiie it because it frightened the n ylrioTri horses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">k</span><span class="font5"> wsm wd riirilar vehicle, hot less </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">-is.-</span><span class="font5">r&gt; tve, was bu’I by A. J. Reese, Augusta, Ky., in ’58 and v. a- the fit st steam-driven con-triv, to travel Kentucky highways, long preceding steam threshers. Another relatively old automobile, built in 1891, was until recently in active use jn t ’rance and was exhibited in Paris in 1921, atom ingmuch interest. The patriarchal ©Id bus has iron rim wheels and an engine hidden below the body of the car. Its motor is even now as good as ever.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">America entered the automobile field late in the day. One of the patriarchs in this country is Elwood Haynes, whose first ear was tried out on July 4th, 1894. On that date Mr. Haynes, then living at Kokomo, Ind., had his auto drawn by a horse three miles out on a level road. He then took a brave chance, unhitched the horse, and same tearing in over those miles in twenty-six minutes, or at the rate of seven miles an hour!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A year before Haynes made his trial trip at Kokomo, French racing machines had made fifty miles an hour on the old </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guttenberg, N.</span><span class="font5"> J. race track, at the Three Counties Fair, in 1893. Two years later, at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Heradd</span><span class="font5"> Contest at Englewood, Chicago, the best speed made by any American machine was seven miles an hour. This was November 28,1895.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Mr. Haynes came to Chicago to participate in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times-IIeratd</span><span class="font5"> Contest, he had proceeded not more than six or eight blocks down. Michigan Avenue when a policeman insisted that he leave the boulevard at once and continue his journey by a back street. Auto™ mobiles were in disfavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America finally stepped on the gas in 19011902. In the fall of the latter year the Automobile Club of America entered seventy-five starters in a race from New York to Boston and return. The speed limit was fixed at 14 miles an hour. All but seven of the starters finished the trip. Th-re are Fords now in use that are over 20 yews old--and they look it</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">try has ox course greatly affected the railways. The automotive freight shipped over the railroads of the United Stares last year amounted to 3.040,000 carloads, a very great factor in IM railroad traffic of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it necessarily follow that a very Jarga part of those 3,040,000 carloads will cut into the future freight loadings of at least some of tha railroads of the country. Every one of those cars will carry either freight or passengers, and that is the business and the only business raite roads have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every now and then reports come in that thia* or that branch line of some railroad has beeB abandoned, and many more will have to go. TW short line railroad is a bad investment, except under unusual conditions. Thft motor bus aW the motor truck can do all its work and giw tetter service for less money. </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Not</span><span class="font5"> ar® the rail»&gt; roads always treated fairly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Boston and Mte'ne Railroad Company has pointed out that while it was compelled to pay $152,000 in local raxes from Greenfield to Springfield, inclusive, much of which went ifttft ♦he ccnsuractjon and maintenance of highway^ practically aU of its passenger business wa»7 taken away by bus companies which, paid mA- ‘ irg for the use of the toghways thus provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only section of the country where the railroads admit having been benefited by the automobile is in the so-called Black Belt of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. -The railroads in this area are far apart, and there are not many first-class highways. In this area the automobile has become a feeder of rail’ road traffic instead of a competitor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Enthusiasts of the auto affect to believe that in time it may displace the railroad altogether, but we think the railroads are here to stay. Th© economy and efficiency with which railroads can haul immense loads at- high speed seems to give them a permanent place in human plans. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it is pointed out that while a railway locomotive is hardly safe at a higher speed than 65 miles per hour, yet a racing automobile on a broad firm road can make 90 or 100 miles an hour, and has been known to ran 1,000 mile® .without a stop. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Estimates are that motor vehicles take $200,1 ©00,000 more annually out of the public than the gross earnings of all the railway lines in the ©ountry. The competition is increasing all the time, with air transportation looming up not far, ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">''Automobile® in New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font5">EW YORK is not like many other great cities where the traffic can spread out. The island of Manhattan is long and narrow, which makes an ugly traffic problem to handle, but it is sur-, prising to see how well it is handled. Traffic moves rapidly and in great volume. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Automobiles and tracks work much damage' to city property in a year. In Central Park alone about four cast iron lamp posts are mowed down every week, with more in winter than in summer. The smashing of sidewalk corners, due to turning the<sub>4</sub>eomers too sharply, is a common occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Th® speed law of New York City is 30 miles, </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font5"> fine; 31 miles, $31, with $1 extra for each additional mil®. For second offenders a fine of $50 and two days in jail; for third offenders, $100 fine and five days in jail, plus revocation of license.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Parking is a problem in every city, and increasingly. It is specially difficult in New York. !A change in parking regulations has been known to ruin a restaurant, which could not aecommo-ftate itself to the resultant loss of patrons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is estimated that 75% of the tracking business of New York City is in the hands of the United States Tracking Corporation, which is an amalgamation of twenty-seven or more smaller concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many a narrow-minded pinhead who would not have an ex-convict in his employ, in office or factory, confidently entrusts himself and all his valuables to these same poor fellows, who must work at something, and who have found that they can make an honest living by driving a track or a taxi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And it is not so easy, either. Sometimes a taxicab driver will lose two hours waiting for a , passenger. He must be of sound physique, with ‘ good eyes, without epilepsy, vertigo or heart trouble, dean in dress and person and not addicted to intoxicants. The taxi rates are low to New York City—15^ or 20$ for the first onefourth mile, and Rt for each additional onefourth mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Automobiles in. Other L^nds</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HEBE are over half a million automobiles in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Great Britain, a like number in Canada, and a slightly less number in France. Germany, Australia and Argentina each have over 100,000. Italy, Belgium, Spain and India each have 50,000 or more; while New Zealand, British South Africa, Sweden, Dutch East Indies, Brazil, Mexico and Cuba each have 30,000 or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">, The United States has one automobile for every six persons, Hawaii one for every eleven, Canada one for every thirteen. At last reports Afghanistan had one ear, the kingdom, of the Hedjaz had four cars all told, and in Ch</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5">a there was one car for every 31,871 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1907 an Italian drove his motor car from Peking to Paris, a distance of 10,000 miles, without a mishap. The trip was mad® via the Gobi desert, Moscow and Berlin, and consumed eight weeks. One of the most elaborate ImUet-yroof ears ever made is owned by the governor-general of Manchuria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Spain imported 14,000 ears last year and is now expecting to make her own, or at least soma of them. Britain and Japan prefer small rara.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Comes of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Airtowtsbile Accidents</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE causes of automobile accidents are being -1 examined, critically at this time. Most of the accidents are the fault of the drivers of the cars. When drivers go out without knowing whether or not brakes and steering gear are in good order, whether or not there are any loose nuts, whether or not there is plenty of gasoline, oil and water in the ear, and whether or not there are proper tools and spare inner tubes on hand, trouble may be confidently expected sooner or later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Headlight glare is a cause of many accidents. The General Electric Company is trying to perfect a system of lighting country roads which may make the use of headlights less necessary than at present. But how a driver can be presented from using bright headlights when he should use dim ones is a puzzle yet unsolved. A. late device illuminates the front hubs of cars, so as to indicate the extreme width, and in a measure offset the effect of headlight glare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Drivers gel too self-eonfident. They increase Meir speeds beyond either necessity or reason, gad when, something goes wrong they find the car is out of control. Experienced drivers occasionally go to Bleep at the wheel, especially cm long, straight, level stretches of read. It is ri </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">aim</span><span class="font5">ed that only one out of four drivers approaches grade crossings 'with sufficient cam to insure safety. .....m; ■.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">(1) Always remember you are an engineer, fully responsible. (2) Always test your brakes when starting, and have them inspected frequently. (3) Never pass a street ear when it is stopping, or, if the law permits, proee<sup>,</sup>'d very slowly past it at the legal distance. (4) Exercise especial care in crossing in front of &amp;&nbsp;street ear or in passing it. as you cannot tell what may be coming on the other side. (5) Always signal with hand when slowing down, turning or stopping, even though you have an automatic or mechanical warning device. (6) Look before you back, and sound the born three times. (7) Try to drive with using the horn as little as possible. A sudden noise may stop pedestrians in their tracks rather than warn them. (8) Do not cxmnt too much on the common, sense of the other fellow. No one is 100 percent alert all the tune. (9) Drive slowly in streets where children are playing. Remember your own ehihlhood, (10) Cross crossings cautiously Warning bells may be out of order, watchmen or gate oper-ato-s may be off duty. Trains cannot stop as quickly as you can. Shift into second to avoid stalling on tracks,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The courts do what they can to protect society also. Fines, jail sentences, the impounding of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">machin</span><span class="font5">es, and the bringing of crippled victims face to face with those that have maimed them, have all been used. In New York a child who lost both arms by a truck running up on the sidewalk was awarded $60,000. But even $60,-000 for the loss of both arms is nothing. Who would be willing to lose one aim. for that sum, to say nothing of both?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">u»adtines m operation, the consideration of automobile fatalities is an unpleasant task. The total nuumte killed by aiwomubiLs in the United States jr. W’&quot;J was 22,500.

<p><span class="font5">The steaJj.y inci^asing deata &lt;-ate for several years was due to the greatly increased use of automobiles owir the year previous. In 1917 there were only a fourth oi the autos on the streets of America that there were m 1925. It stands to reason that four times as many ears would make some increase in the fatalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In St. Louis a monument has been erected to automobile-killed children. It bears the inscription, &quot;In memory of child life, sacrificed on the altar of uaste and lecklessness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Does Siotwinff Breed Rudenew^</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is a general impression among many that motoring breeds rudeness, that there is not the fellow feeling for those in trouble that once prevailed among those who used the highways. There is no question but that the ownership of an automobile generates in certain types of minds a. feeling of power, selfishness, and disregard of the rights of others which engenders like feelings on the part of those who have been mistreated. When one has been treated with discourtesy by another, or by several, the tendency is. to pass it on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hogging the road, hogging the parking spaces, refusing to help fellow autoists in trouble, and thanklessness or worse toward those who do go out of their way to help—all move in one general direction. Besides this there are many drivers of automobiles who have no good intentions toward anybody. It is well known that the automobile is one of th@ greatest auxiliaries of crime. Every modern </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">gang</span><span class="font5"> of criminals has its chauffeuras a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some small towns are discourteous to all auto-mobilists passing their way, by seeming to take it for granted that every one should know the name of the town, a most unreasonable idea. Courtesy begets courtesy. Ill-treatment or discourteous treatment </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">suggests &amp;</span><span class="font5">&nbsp;like course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Effect upon the Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font5">T HAS never been claimed for the automobile that it is an unmixed blessing. To hold that its effect upon the health is uniformly good would start an argument right away. There are people who are made nervous by automobile ndinv, and there are men in New York who are vr-nliing to come to Now York City by that mod** ui conveyance for that reason.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">An auto expert recommends using a stethoscope for listening to the heart-beats of *he motor. He has found this valuable in locating causes of trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Autos are shattered by bumps. A car that is kept on -smooth roads will last almost indefinitely. The more the bumps the shorter the lite of the car. No machinery ever made can stand such rough usage continually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Parking ears so that they rub against the curb makes the wheels wobbly. Wobbly tvheels wear out a tire in a fraction of the time otherwise required. Loose spokes also greatly reduce the life of the tires.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font5">T IS predicted that as the automobile engine was really the cause of the airplane coming into practical use, so the development of the airplane engine will ere long greatly increase the power of the motor car. The claim is made that a six-cylinder engine need not weigh more ilian 120 pounds to generate fifteen horsepower and give thirty to forty miles to the gallon of gas. The Diesel engine in miniature offers possibilities of even greater mileage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is predicted that the closed car of the future may not weigh over 9C0 pounds and that it may be principally made of cotton. Great improvements are considered possible in the tire mechanism. involving not the abandonment of rubber but alternate rings of it with, other materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to know that the steering wheels of Ford ears -are made of .straw, mixed with rubber and other materials, and subjected to live steam while under a pressure of 2,000 pounds do the square inch. As it cools it takes ©n an almost flint-like hardness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some persons profess to believe that the time will come when automobiles will be propelled by coal dust, which may happen, for almost anything can happen nowadays; but it does not sound very convincing. A French scientist declares that the automobile of the future will h@ driven by water, which will be catalyzed in the car, so that the propulsive force will be hydrogen gas. This does not sound convincing, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Il is significant'that many inventors in varK </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ob</span><span class="font5"> parts of the world continue their efforts ta find a&quot; substitute for gasoline. Methanol, a Get-ynafr-produet, it f reely predicted, will soon bc-eome cheaper than gasoline and is a better fuel Natalite-, made of-decayed vegetables, garbage and other not at present deleetable materials; it is said can even now almost meet the price of gasoline. In Britain alcohol made from sugar beets and oth^r sugary, starchy or woody materials, is considered a coining fuel. Perhaps Natalite is only another name for this alcohol</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Wilson’s reign, now says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole question of the cancellation of the war debts is based on the theory that the late war was as mneh our sfisir as it was Europe’s, that we were fighting for democracy against German aggression, and that we were obliged to take up arras against Germany as she aimed at world domination which would ultimately involve the United States. This is not the true situation ; as any one realizes who has investigated the facts, read the postwar literature and studied the official documents and state papers that have since come to light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Senator Owen had said this in 1918 he would have been sent to Atlanta. But it is better to tell the truth eight years late than not to teU it at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deaths by Poison Gm</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">P</span><span class="font5">ROBABLY most of those now living will die by poison gas, when the time comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The best for suffocation is phosgene, which eau be earned by the wind far and wide, suffocating all. Mustard gas burns the flesh off. Chloropicrin produces intense vomiting and disablement. Lachrymatory causes floods of tears.

If the snrply of these runs out there are the disease ink Tobes to fall back on.

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font5">T SEEMS impossible for the nations to agree on any method of controlling gas warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All nations are agreed that it should be forbidden, but all are getting ready to use it. Part of the nations want an ironclad agreement that all nations shall unite in a gas attack upon the first nation that uses gas warfare; but as every nation will insist that some other nation used it first, such an agreement would mean nothing; and the United States, Great Britain and Japan ~ have refused to be a party to such a pact. They •would prefer no gas warfare at all.</span></p>

Go if ground, were captured by the batteries of an enemy, it could not be traversed; and no infantry could advance toward the retreating army.

The outfit costs about $20,000, but makes haying independent of the weather, saves all the loaves, which are the best part of the hay, makes the hay more palatable, and saves all the protein and minoials of the hay. It is believed that this device can be used to great advantage in sections where hay is produced prohfically. and whore there is too much wet weather to msure a harvest by usual methods. .All the haj for a locality would need to be dried at the one depot, but the drying cost' per ton would not be excessive.</span></p>

The Federal Bureau of Entomology expended more than $100,000 in the last year in the effort to find a way of exterminating ths pest. The entire state of New Jersey was put under quaiairline for the pest; but it spread to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and up into New York state. In the business part of Philadelphia last August, twenty-eight of the beetles were found on a man’s hut at one time. As many as 300 have been found on one apple. It destroys all plant life, even roots.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font5">OUTHERN cotton growers claim that the gwermneiit’s early cotton report for 1926 cost them al least a half billion dollars, declaring that it caused 787,000 bales to be dumped on the market in one week, and that the price consequently dropped $23 a bale* The growers last fall endeavored to organize the entire South, to get a uniform agreement that, in 1927 only a quarter crop shall be produced. In this agreement, in which bankers and business men are expected to cooperate, the planters hope to find a way to work off their present surplus at a lair price. This is substantially Brazil’s method with coffee, and Britain’s method with rubber.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“But,” you may afo. “ar^ you now about to state what is merely your opinion as to what the future holds 1” I answer, No. The mere opinio^ ©f man on any subject is of small value unless that opinion is supported by competent evidence coming from a truthful source. God’s Word is true. Written in times of old by holy men, who w®re moved upon by the power of Jehovah thus to write, the Bible states what is the purpose of Jehovah God. He never fails in one of His promises. In Jtfo own. due time He will carry them out. Through His prophet Isaiah He says (46:11): “I have purposed it, I will bring it to pass”; and in 55:11: “My word shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that . . . whereto I sent it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In my last lecture here I submitted the Scriptural proof that God created man perfect; in His dup time God will restore the obedient ones of mankind to that original perfection. It therefore becomes of vital interest to krow where the Lome of the perfect man wdl be. It is manifest the* in order to be m harmony with his perfect (Tunis® a perfect mar woi 1J. need &amp;&nbsp;perfect &lt;&nbsp;n<sub>v</sub>, that vhieh is pleasing to the eye and a yjy to the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I*, is &gt;&nbsp;me that the Scriptures show that a few of the ham an race, because of faithfulness dur-ng the Gospel Age, will be changed at the first resmicrtion from luman to spiwt be ncs. But foe forintuies dciimtete show that these will be a very small number. It seems strange, then, fort inieilivent men, who claim to be teachers of firn Bible, have so long held before the people the (bought *nat the only nope of salvation is to go to heaven; and that all those who do not find eternal life </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">uj</span><span class="font5"> heaven must be eternally tormented in some place beneath the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These have passed by entirely the great array of scriptures which show that the habitation of mankind in general will be on the earth. Bean ng upon tins point, it is of very gieat importance to know what kind of home Adam, the perfect man created by God, had and possessed It would he reasonable to expect that the Creator would provide that perfect man a home in harmony with his perfection. The Scriptures leave no doubt as to this, but dearly state:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“‘The name of the first is Pison; that is it which eompasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone, And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that eompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 'And the name of the third river, is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat o&quot; it; for in the day that thou e-atest thereof thou shalt surely die.”— Genesis 2: 8-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">•Weening of Nemes Significant</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">XpVEBY name Jehovah gives to a place has a deep significance. The word “Eden” means a garden, pleasant, delicate, a place of pleasure and deligut. Eton, in fact, was the finished part of the earth, and ths only finished part. When Ged pronounced the curse upon man He said to him concerning the remainder of the earth: “Cursed is tl e ground for thy sake.” This word here rendci eel ‘toursod” means unfinished. God left the rest of the earth unfinished, so that maxi would have employment, and this has been a great blessing to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since God had finished Eden, the proof is clear that Eden was perfectly beautiful beyond the description of human words, because all the creation of God is perfect; and so His Word declares. (Deuteronomy 32:4) We can </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">think </span><span class="font5">®f the most beautiful spot on earth that man’s eye in modern times has yet beheld, and know that Eden was even more beautiful than that. The word “Eden” means a paradise; and the word used by our Lord when He said to the thief, &quot;Thou shalt be with me in paradise/ means Eden, the garden of the Lord. The clergy have long told us that Eden or Paradise is in heaven; yet they have not had any scripture upon which to base this conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Location of Eden</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font5">HERE then was the original garden of Eden! A careful examination of the Scriptures leaves little doubt as to its location. The Scriptures are definite that Eden was in the vicinity of the head of the River Euphrates. The River Euphrates flows from the mountainous district of Armenia into the Persian Gulf, and is made up of four tributaries. It rises in the vicinity of Mt. Ararat, which mountain was on the eastern border of Eden, as the Scriptures clearly indicate. There is nothing to warrant the conclusion that Eden was in a plain; but the proof is overwhelming that it was in a valley, surrounded by high mountains, and that it was accessible only from the east. (Genesis 3:24) Take a map and look at the vicinity of the Persian Gulf, in the present land of Armenia, in the mountainous section, and you have approximately the location of the garden of Eden, the cradle of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When God began the execution of His judgment against Adam and Eve, He drove them out of Eden, so that they could not have access to the tree of life; and He set cherubim and a flaming sword turning in every direction, to keep them away from Eden.—Genesis 3:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Beyond all question of doubt Eden, the garden of th? Lord, was on earth. Therefore the question is settled beyond a doubt that if Paradise is restored it will be on earth. Eden was made for man, and man was placed therein. Eden was Paradise. Man is of the earth, earthy. This is definitely stated in the Scriptures. (1 Corinthians 15:47) Man is not spirit; therefore he could not inhabit a spiritual realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the few of the human race who are to be changed to spirit nature are changed from human to spirit beings, then they will be in th© spirit realm. But the Lord plainly says in His Word, through the Prophet Isaiah: “I have made the earth, and created man upon it I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. . . . God himself that formed the earth and made it; lie hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.”—Isaiah 45:12, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The earth was nevei’ cursed. Jt did not sin; therefore there was no occasion to eurbe it. The earth was left unfinished outside of Eden, Eden alone being a sample of what God would make the whole earth when it is brought up to tho standard which it shall be. It has been a blessed thing for imperfect man, however, to have something to do and to put forth an effort to beautify the earth. This he has done, to his pleasure and profit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The major portion of the earth’s surface today lies a desert waste, untilled. Jehovah, sp wking through His prophet, as to the restoration during the reign of Christ, says: “Thus saith {lie Lord God, In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities, I -will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be budded And the desolate land shall be tilled, vhruas it lay desolate in the sight of all tha^ parsed bv.

<p><span class="font5">1 T MAT not fee out of ulace to ask: What be-came of garden of Eden? Scrip iura&gt; proof is that it was surrounded by very high mountains, that it was accessible only from the east, that it is and was in the vicinity of Mount Ararat, and that Mount Ararat was the site upon which Noah’s ark landed, which has since been hidden under perpetual snow. It does not seem reasonable that the Lord would have destroyed Eden; but it seems more reasonable that the Lord would have preserved it so that in His due time He will exhibit it to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through His prophet Job. God said: “Hast thou entered into the treasures of the Snow?” (Job 38:22) Doubtless Eden is one of the treasures of the snow preserved by the Lord in perpetual snow and ice. The inspired writer of the Scriptures declares that with the second presence of the Lord He will bring to light the hidden things of darkm-ss. (1 Corinthians 4:5) The Lord Jesus hii well said: “For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest; neither anything hid thM shall not be known.”—Luka 8:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the light of these scriptures it is reasonable for us to conclude that when God has restored man and brought the earth to an Edenie paradise, and all wickedness is eliminated, and everything in the earth is in harmony with G~od, then He will unseal the secret treasures of the snow and exhibit to restored man his original perfect home. Amongst those restored, who shall behold the glories and beauties thereof, will be Adam. And the whole earth then will be likened to the garden of Eden. Eden shall be the joy of man. and all the people in the earth will be joyful and happv.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then mankind will appreciate the love of God, and will sing the praises of Jehovah and His beloved Son, Christ Jesus. This song of praise, wafted on the breezes, will be caught up by tire angels and the other heavenly creatures, until every creature tn heaven and in earth, and even the very elements of the earth, shall be singing the Hallelujah chorus to the glory of God. Then will be Tully realized the goodness of God, and trit creatwes sb-ull Le saying. “Great and marvellous are thy vw/ks, Loid God Almighty; just and true arc thy ws, thou King of saints.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A restored race, a. restored home, with peace and joy and eudfess happiiw-s T'iug every heart; with theu loved on&lt; s xvitlx them; with no fear of ever being separated ag»in; with everything in the earth being to the Iiord’s glory, earth then wll indeed be a paradise, a fit place for perfect rnan to dwell in complete harmony with God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Station WBBR on a wave length of 416.4 meters by K. H. Barber.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE most highly organized, the most influential and the most firmly entrenched institution on the earth is that institution which men call ecelesiasticism. It is also the most respected and revered institution of earth, and in its present form its history spans nearly fifteen centuries. It is held in such high estimation by the people in general that to differ from its teachings is regarded as near heresy, and to criticise it as near crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the discussion of this subject I do not wish to be understood as having any </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font5"> animus either against ecclesiastics or against ecclesi-astieism.

In this belief I shall discuss the subject without malice and without partial, ty</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">EFOB.E I proceed it is first necessary that we have some definitions so that we can discuss this subject intelligently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is an ecclesiastic, and what is ecclesi-astieism! An. ecclesiastic is one officially set apart for religious service, a clergyman. Eccle-siasticism is a system of religion organized by ecclesiastics, by clergymen—a system of religion which arbitrarily decrees what dogmas or teachings are correct and what doctrines are incorrect. Those who </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">endorse</span><span class="font5"> the teachings of ecelesiasticism are called orthodox, and those who do </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> are called unorthodox. In some circles it is considered quite a disgrace to be called unorthodox, but in reality it is an honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ecelesiasticism arrogates to itself the right to excommunicate and punish those who do not agree with its pronouncements. In recent times the punishment consists mainly of religious and social ostracism; but history abounds with records of many thousands of instances where the ecclesiastical punishment for the excommunicated “heretics” was death, being thrown to the lions, or burned at the stake, or torn asunder, or skinned alive, or dipped into boiling oil, or having hot lead poured into their ears, or their tongues jerked out by the roots, or their eyes gouged out, in the name of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If more people would read the ecclesiastical history of the past 1900 years, more people would question the audacious claims of ecclesiastics and ecelesiasticism today. This </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">claimed </span><span class="font5">right to determine what teachings are correct, and to excommunicate and punish those who disagree, has come to be called “Ecclesiastical Authority”—- something which is not mentioned in the Bible at all, but which is discussed at great length in the writings of ecclesiastics themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is really ludicrous to read the clergy’s laborious efforts to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">prove</span><span class="font5"> their “Ecclesiastical Authority” by quoting the writings of other ecclesiastics who have preceded them, nearly all of whom were pagans or else lived back in the dark ages; but not one single proof can they adduce from the Scriptures in support of their claim. According to the Scriptures, the only ecclesiastical authority vested in anyone is vested in Jehovah God and in His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; and this authority is theirs by right, for the reason that they are the Creators of all life, the Ones who have the right to bestow everlasting life, and because every right and true doctrine came from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible forbids any man or body of men to judge or condemn those who are earnestly trying to serve the Lord according to tlw dictates of their conscience. Let me quote a few of its statements. In Homans 14:4 we read: “Who are thou that judgest another man’s servant ? to his own master he standeth or falleth.” Verse 10 of the same chapter reads: “But why dost thou judge thy brother! or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.” Man cannot render a proper judgment, because man looketh on the outward appearance, but God alone can read the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Matthew 7:1-5, is a statement that every ecclesiastic ought to con over and over again, until the real thought percolates through the theological nonsense that befogs his mind. I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">quote in part t “Judge not, that ye be not judged. :ft|P:&lt;with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged. . . . Thou hypocrite, first cast out the b&lt; an wri thine own eye; and then shalt thou see dearly to cast out the mote out .of thy broth-eris eye.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the purpose .of this lecture to show that :hcriesisstieism, as a system, was not organized <sup>:S</sup>byi-fhe Lord, that it is an. abomination in- his sight; also to show why God hates it; and that the Bible clearly points out that it is soon to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">u; _• a. I think it proper to clear up another matter which has a bearing on this subject:</span></p>

Evidently our critics do not know what the word “Intolerance” means. Bible Students are not intolerant; neither-is Station WBBR. Intolerance means to hinder another from expressing his opinion, or to persecute him. for so doing, and neither the International Bible Students nor Station WBBR has ever done this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has tolerated the Devil for 6000 years, but has repeatedly exposed his wickedness and has denounced him as a liar and a hypocrite., God could have destroyed Satan, or hindered him, at any time; but instead of doing this He tolerated him. Jesus tolerated the Devil and the scribes and Pharisees; He .made no attempt to persecute them or to interfere with their teachings, except to expose them, to show up the sham, the fraud and hypocrisy of their system. He did not attempt to have a heresy law passed, forbidding them to teach on paia of death; that would have been intolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil, on the contrary, is the personification. of intolerance; he tried in every way to kill the Lord, aadsfiiiHly: Siiceeeded, The scribes and Pharisees were also■ intoferant.; they sought in wmr&gt; IC <sup>l</sup>’d' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">~ir: Cm</span><span class="font5"> '''jrl'S</span></p>

It was intolerance that murdered firamxter, Ridley and Latimer for their religious, beliefs. .History records the feet that intolerance caused 50.000.000 people during <sup>+</sup>he dark-ages to be murdered,: for daring to believe: and teach what they thought to few the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Intolerance makes heresy laws. It was intojy erance on the part of several hundred D«m&gt;; men when during the World War they met in Philadelphia and passed a resolution as</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ki</span><span class="font5">ng our government to make death the penalty for</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">&lt;, who .were, conscientious objectors to war. But, thank God, the government was more honorable than the clergy, and refused to be parties to such a dastardly scheme.</span></p>

Again Jesus said, in John. 8: 55, “I know my Father, and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you.” Surely that is very plain language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Acts 8:21-23. Peter said to Simon, who wanted to buy the gift of laying on of hands, with money: “Thy heart is not right in the sight of the Lord. ... I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity .* Again in Acts 13:10, Patil said to Elymas the sorcerer: “O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?” From these scriptures we can see that it is not intolerance to show up false doctrines, or to show up the wrong in connection with anything that misrepresents God or His truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is notieesble: that the most intolerant peo pie on earth are the ones, who are always charging others with intoleruMee.

The Bible points e<sup>,r</sup>t V c organisations, God’s organization and the Devil's organization. God’s organization Jv s mwavs stood for and supported and defended the tr.dh. The Devil’s organization has always, covertly and by every foul and unfair means conceivable, opposed the Lord, opposed the triPl. c Tpwcd righteousness and opposed and persecuted all of the Lord’s faithful people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These two organizations, Satan's and God’s, are first, brought to our attention in the garden of Eden. There they are called, respeebvely, the “seed of the woman” and “the seed of the serpent”. The Lord said that He would put enmity between these two seeds, but that eventually the seed of the woman would bruise the Serpent’s head. The Serpent is the Devil, and the seed of the Serpent is that organization of men which the Devil uses to accomplish his purpose of persecuting the seed of the woman. That organization is ecclesiasticism. Nor are we left in doubt as to who constitute the seed of the woman. It is the true church; the true saints; the true followers of Jesus; those who have stood for the truth and right at all times; those who have defended God’s name and have continually and always shown up the Devil’s organ.z? t’on, iU sham, its hypocrisies and lies, as well as its hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J rs ,iis letter to the church at Rome, addressed to ‘ ml tbai oe in </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ro.ts,</span><span class="font5"> beloved of God. called lo be sauits&quot;, Tail says: “The God of peace phall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.” (Romans 16: 29) The seed of the woman was to bnu^e the Serpent’s head, and in this text the apuslle tells us that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">saints</span><span class="font5"> are to do the bruising. The saints are the true chinch. The true church is God’s organization. The Lord says to these: “Ye are the light of the vcorld”; and “ye are ambassadors for Christ”. He tells them to put oxi the whole armor of God; preach the truth, in season and out of season. He says to them$ “Ye are my witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The true church, God’s organization, has been in the world for 1900 years, but the world has not recognized it; hence it. is called in the Bib “The mystery of God.” (Revelation 10:8) Th® Apostle Raul, in 2 Thessalonians 2:7, calls tlia Devil's organization, which is the seed of the serpent, the “mystoiy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">iniquity&quot;—</span><span class="font5">an appropriate name Indeed, for it has sponsored every iniquitous thing that has been on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this same diopter the apostle says that the Lord wiH de^irov ibis mvstery of iniquity at His ,’cco’i advent. The Devil’s organization, fecclosia&amp;tAcisifj<sub>s</sub> i&amp; called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“the mystery</span><span class="font5"> of iniquity” for the reason that although it has been in the world for many centuries, yet it has be(-« unrecuumzed as the Devil’s organization. Th® Devil has fooled the people into believing that his organization is the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For 1900 years the Lord has been quietly, but unknown to the world and unknown to the unfaithful clergy class, selecting out His church of 144,000 members. They have been called, “The seed of the woman,” “the seed of Abraham,” “the seed of promise,” also “the holy seed” and “the seed which the Lord hath blessed”. (Isaiah 6:13: 61: 9) This class is also spoken of many times in the Bible as a “remnant”, because of their small number. The Devil’s organization on the contrary has been called, “The seed of the serpent,” “the jpystery of iniquity,” and “the seed of the adulterer and the whore”. (Isaiah 57: 3) The Lord says to the true church, <sup>!</sup>Come out of the world, touch not the unclean thing.<sup>8</sup></span></p>

Hence, if she should join with the financial and political powers now, and cooperate tvitb them iu administering civil government, she would be called an adulteress, a harlot, a whore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the true church is true to her Lord, and does not attempt to reign without her Lord. On the contrary, the system of religion known as ecclesiasticism’ is continually dabbling in politics, and claims the right to do so. In the Bible the union of the church with the political factors is called adultery. This is why the seed ©J the Serpent, the Devil’s organization, ecclesi-®sticism, is called the &quot;‘seed of the adulterer and the whore”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of the various denominational ©hurch systems of the earih, the Apostle Jameg says, ’&quot;Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know y® not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will he a friend of the world is the enemy of God” (James 4:4) Everybody knov’g That ecclesiastieism is doing all in her power to gain the friendship of the wcrid, end to become a pc-wr m pop tics. She is trying to reign before the Lord begins His leiern. Hmic^ the Lord speaks of her as an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">an-fr-Jpful</span><span class="font5"> woman; and He has rejected her; Ke is nA Lisijg her to accompliwi H.s purposes in the earth at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notice how ccclcsiastieism came into existence: God planted the nation of Israel, at the death of Jacob, by choosing the twelve sons of Jacob, and making them the heads of the twelve ti-ihes of Israel. Thereafter Israel was God&quot;s organization. God entered into a covenant with them, promising them blessings if they would be faithful to that covenant and punishments if they broke the covenant. He gave them a system of religion, which. was a perfect one. They were also given priests and altars and sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But selfish and ainbtiions mon, who desired to exploit, the people, who desired honor for themselves, who loved to be praised and flattered. who loved power and influence, gradually got the control cf God’s organization, and so perverted it and its use that when Jesus came into the world He rejected it and started a new organization entirely. These ambitious men, under the guidance of Satan, had divided the Israelites into different sects, known as serihH? Pharisees. Sadducees, Herodians, Essenes, etc. This was contrary to God’s arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The leaders of these various sects had formulated creeds cf their own, and Jesus said te them, ‘&quot;Ye teach for doctrines the command-meats of men.’’ They loved the uppermost seats in the synagogues: they loved to pray in public, standing on the street corners, to be seen of xnen; they loved to be called Eabbi and Father. These leaders were ecclesiastics; they assumed authority and power which did not belong to them; they lorded it over God’s heritage, browbeating the people into submission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fJesns found eedesiastieism enthroned when He came to earth—a great and powerful man-made organization, full of hypocrisy and deceit; the tool of the Devil; oppressing the people; teaching doctrines which slandered Jehovah God. and its leaders so out of harmony with God and the Bible that with wicked and murder-ous hearts they killed John the Baptist. erac-L fled the Lord Jesus and murdered eleven of twelve of the apostles of the Lamb. This wicked s&gt;yr cm vns the eeclesiasticism cf that da;. No vender Jesus rejected it and declared that it would jorthwith be ^esfioycd from the cairbi</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Oue of Israel’s prophets had ioretoxd the corrup.ion of Israel by the Devil. I quote Jeremiah 2: 21. 22: t I had planted thee a imhi? vine, wholly a right seed: Low then ait thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me! For though thou wa«h thee with n t.er<sub>5</sub> and take thee much, soap, yet thine iniq.ii-«.y is marked before me, saith the Lord.<sup>5</sup>® Speaking of this same thing, in Matthew 21:33-43, Jesus spake cf Israel as a vineyard let out to husbandmen, who lulled their lord’s servants, and finally killed his son; and then He asked the question, ‘&quot;What will the householder do unto .hose husbandmen? He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and let the vineyard cut to other husbandmen, who will bring him the fruit? in their season.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the day of Pentecost the Lord established His true church, IDs organization. The record is that He sowed good seed but that an. enemy came and sowed tares. The good seed wew the children the kingdom, while the tares arg the children of the wicked one. After the- a pegties died, gradually the same ..class of ..-selfish, money-loving, power-loving, domineering clergy got control of the Lord’s organisation-^again. Just a few j ears after Jesus’ death, the Apostle Paul, writing to the true saints at- Thessalonica? said: ‘&quot;The mystery of iniquity doth already work?<sup>5</sup> (2 Thessalonians 2:7) Gradually the tares, the children of the wicked one, came “fo' outnumber the w heat Selfishness was enthroned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bely PaliUciwa</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font5">OW the second advent of the Lord has come, and what is the situation? We find ecelesi-asfieism. split up into mrmmerable sects and bolding a great variety of contradictory ereeds; we find the majority of the modern clergy opeiw ly denying the inspiration of the Bible, denying the virgin birth of Jesus, loving to be called Rabbi, Father, Reverend, Right Reverend, D. D.<sub>r</sub>LL. D., etc., claiming that they are the only cues who can interpret the Scriptures, and yet unable to interpret any portion of it correctly; actually discouraging Bible study, by telhng their flocks that the Bible is a book of mystery and not intended to be understood except by those who ha»e taken a seven-year course in a theological seminary, and telling others that if they study it toe much they will go to the in-saae a=p mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We fmd that the clergy now, instead of following ihrir professed ctilhng. have become the chief pobtvians of the day, and ate glorying in the fact diet rimy ^-ero the chief 'homers for war and note, a wl that as a reward they nra rapidly cornL.g to be recognized as a power in the WGrla’s pritoW. This is the great &quot;holy” system pic-uJly eai.ed eceksiasueism. This system, the Devil's masterpiece, “the mystery of ini-$VJty,<sup>w</sup> began to ti n </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">rh</span><span class="font5"> in the days of the apostles. TUs means that stilish men who coveted ecclesiastical authority were beginning to creep into the church and were stealthily and craftily working to get control of the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gradually the ecclesiastics formulated creeds which misrepresented both Jehovah God and the Bible, chief among which are the doctrines of inherent immortality of the soul, the trinity and the eternal torment myth. Gradually they ap-Gwd a power and authority over the minds and consciences of people which God never delegated to any man or set of men on earth. Then followed penalties upon those who refused to recognize their creeds and their assumed authority. Very soon the state was asked to make lavw to enforce thfse penalties, and in return for these favors the e’ergy pledged their sup-p *it to the state, and the union of church and state was pride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bibles were forbidden and burned; and true Bible students were persecuted to death in horrible ways. Nearly 1300 years of indescribable cruelty, hatred, persecution, wickedness and murder followed; and those 1300 years have been aptly called “'The Dark Ages”. Who was responsible for those years of crime and intrigue against man and God, against tru*h and righteousness? History records the fact that ecclesiastics, using their powerful organization, called ecclesiasticism, were responsible for all these dark deeds. Those thirteen centuries dl suppression of the truth and pe t’secution of the Lord’s saints stand, on the pages of history^ credited to the &quot;Holy” Roman Caflwii® Churck</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the 16th century the Protestant Ref» ormation began. It was instituted as a worldwide protest against the wickedness of Papacy. Manin Luther started that protest. He repudiated the doctrines of human immortality, and eternal torment: repudiated the mass, and branded Papacy as the Antichrist. Thore was such a revulsion of sennment against ecclesiastieism that its power to persecute to the death was destroyed, and most of the governments which had previously supported it now repudiated it.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">OR a time the protests continued, and along several different lines. Gradually, however, the Devil began to organize Protestantism. II® saw tn it that certain wicked, selfish and designing men were allowed to gain the control of the various branches of Protestantism. These men began to claim authority; and as a result, bishops, synods and councils came into existence, all claiming the right to make creeds, to excommunicate, and to decide what is orthodox and what is not. Shortly Protestantism became thoroughly organized into a great ecclesiastical system, and now there was the spectacle of two rival ecclesiastical organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But in our day the tendency is to forget the past, and the two great systems are overlooking their creedal differences and are trying to get together. Protestants are no longer protesting. The great thing desired by the leaders ofi both these systems is power and more power. To gain this power, they are entering vigorously into polities, and demanding legislation which is intended to regulate the morals and consciences of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eeelesiasticism secured the enactment of the prohibition law. It is now trying to stop Sunday amusements and games, by making them illegal. This is intolerance of the worst kind. It is a censorship of the consciences and morals of the masses of the people by the neck* ria sties. The logical outcome will be a supervision </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font5">business, of the home and of w hat shall bet-iught in the common schools, as well as in the theological schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To enforce such law's, a spy syriem will found n&lt; cessary and convenient, as will also the righ' to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font5"> arch the person and private property without a warrant, by the most irresponsible pei--oils.

<p><span class="font5">.VL” aie v,e so sure about this matter? The reason ’' hru the Scriptures point out that the Itevil vill make one more determined stand &lt;‘<sup>,</sup>own here in the end of the age, as Christ’s kirgdm.i is being set up, one more effort to perpetuate his empire by enthroning ecclesiastic.'a; and inst when it looks as though he wotdo sue t „d, God will, destroy Satan’s entire (ugarcetion with a complete and everlasting ckfetnctirm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon ike Great</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font5">X THE 17th chapter of Revelation eeriest-atticism is called a woman, and is also called</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Babylon. We will quote verses 3-6: ‘T saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of b’a&amp;pljemy. . . . The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornications; and up on her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth. And I saw the wo nan drunken with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">true to 1’aus ihis prophecy is, for it has been eccbria4icJ<sup>c</sup>ui tha* has murdered the saliO all down through this Gospel Age. Tins woman is described in verse one as sitting npc a many waters, and in verse fifteen the Bevelator Rajs; “The waters which thou rawest . . . are peoples, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">S'</span><span class="font5"> d multitudes, and nations, and tongw'w” Thus we see that waters represent the people of every land, and everyone knows tha* eeelt das^ici’iu is a world-wide institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In vers» sixteen the destruction of the abomination is foretold, in these words: “And the ten horns and the boast shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall cat her flesh and burn her with fire.” The present condition of ^cclmaslicism is described in Jtevriation in these words: “Babylon the Great is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.” This means that it is full of false doctrines, and its membership is composed of wicked men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But associated with these wicked profiteers and hypocrites and blasphemers are some of the Lord’s sheep, blinded, deluded and wretched. They know not what to do. They see the selfishness and wickedness of the great system, and sn verse 4 the Lord says to them: &quot;Come out of her, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">my people,</span><span class="font5"> that yc be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues.” And in verse eight we read: “She shall be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">iBselemstieim As It Is</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">UMMING up then, we find that ecdesiasti-cism was organized by Satan; that its purpose has been and is to blind men to the truth about God, to turn men away from God and to keep them from a study of the Bible; that it misrepresents God and the Bible; that it fosters hypocrisy; that it mocks God; that its influence in the world is baneful; that it destroys liberty of thought; that it throttles free speech; that it deprives man of his God-given, free moral agency; that it assumes authority over individual conscience and reason; that it is full of confusion and inconsistency; that it promotes superstition and mysticism; that its teachings are false; that it has always been a persecuting power, and an active supporter of every war on earth,. It is because of all these and other wickednesses that the apostle describes it as a woman &quot;having a golden cup in her hand full of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">abominations</span><span class="font5"> and filthiness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thank God that this wicked institution is to be destroyed! But- what is to become of those ecclesiastics who formed the ijwiTation? I ask you to read Jeremiah 23rd chapter, also Ezekiel Mth chapter; and when reading these chapters just substitute the word clergymen for the words pastors, prophets and shepherds, which occur in these chapters, and you. will get some idea of what the Lord has in reservation for those selfish, cruel and wicked men who have been guilty of organizing, promoting and perpetuating this wicked institution of darkness, by which God’s goodness has long been misrepresented or hidden from view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few of the verses from the 23rd chapter of Seremiah read;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. “Woe he unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture.'*'</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">15. “Thus saith the Lord concerning the pxophet.su Behold I will feed them with woim-wood and make them drink the water of gall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21. <sup>f</sup>T have not sent these prophets, yet they </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">tp</span><span class="font5">n; I have r c t spoken to then </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span><span class="font5"> yet th ?y prop e-sied.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">40. “And I will bring an pvedssvnig reproach upon you. and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I suggest that my hearers read the entix® chapter; it is wonderfully interesting, and wil! give you a splendid idea of the opinion which Jehovah God has of ecclesiastics. I irn glad to believe that there are some good men among ecclesiastics, and I am hoping that this lecture may be heard and prove a blessing co some &amp;&amp;• them, hclptog them to sea just how God regards the system wbirii they are ignorantly cncourag* tog mid sv'*porti’jg I do not expect th,’t H will bo sr predated by all.

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE churches, Reman Catholic and Protestant, have blessed every war that has been Icraght in the earth, in fifteen hundred years; and now seems like a good time to recall the bless* togs of the last one, which could not have been fought and would not have been fought if the so-called ehurehes had lived up to the teachings of Jesus Christ The World War directly murdered 10,004,771 soldiers; 2,000.000 Russian civilians died as the direct result of war privations; over 1,000,000 Serbian and Austrian civilians died through famine, fever and disease; 4,000,000 Armenians, Syrians, Jews and Greeks were massacred; while practically all the Polish children under six years of ago died of starvation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Turning now to Groat Britain: We note that in that one country, while 946,023 were killed or died ©f wounds and sickness on active service, 600,000 more were wounded in such a way that their earning power will never be the same again; WOJJOO children lost their fathers; 123,703 men who went info the war sound are now either armless, legless, totally blind, insane, futorctoap epileptic or deaf.

<p><span class="font5">ITOE word GOD means Mighty One or Great -*• One, and in speaking of the God of the Bible, we often say, “The Almighty One.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a long, long time people knew very, very little about the real God, Jehovah; but we are fortunate now to be living in a time when even the small boys and girls can know more about God than the grown-ups did a few generations ago. This is possible because we are able to understand our Bibles much better than the people did in former times. It is not because we are so much wiser than they, but because the time has come fo's* the people to understand the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was on earth He said that the time would cows when the people should know the tenth, and the tru<sup>f</sup>h vould make them free. (John 8:32) New ve have read fed that time. Aie you not glad to be living at this time? I am, and I am especially glad that we have come to know the God cf the Bible su much better than people did in former times.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">v.ho do not yet know the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">reed</span><span class="font5"> God. The herdhen ia loirign lands, the savages in Africa and in the islands of the sea, do not know </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">our Ged.</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah. He really </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is our God!</span><span class="font5"> Is not that a comforting feet! But thvse heathen people have other gods—some which they have mads wifi* their own hands out of wood, stone, and ©thoi materials. We call these gods “idols”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the fact is, they really are not gods at all; for a God must be a Mighty Oue, with intelligence, wisdom and power. These idols know nothing. They have no brains, knowledge, wisdom, povor nor life. In fact, they are simply pieces of wood or stone, crudely carved and fashioned after some sort of image of God which their makers have vaguely in. their minds; and their image of God is a very poor one. Are not you soiry for such people who do not know what God is like I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible tells us about people in olden times who made and worshiped idols. Some of the stories it tells of them are horrible to think about There was one big idol which these people called Moloch, that was made in the shape of a human being; but in reality it was a big furnace. In the lower part of this furnace hot fires were built, which heated the idol red hot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ignorant people who worshiped it would place their little babies in the arms of this terrible idol, which would then be raised up and pressed against its bosom until the babies were literally cooked alive. Do you not think that v<sup>v</sup>as an awful idea of God for anyone to have? Are you not glad that -we have a better knowledge of the true God than these people had in those days?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Onlg Tioo Gads</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">pID you know that there is another powerful godbesides Jehovah? There is! The Bible tells us that thex-e are two Gods. One is Jehovah; arid the other is Satan, that Old Serpent and Dragon the Devil. There are many people who worship the Dew. In fact, we know now that all of the heathen nations really worship him mid de what he wants them to Jo. The idols are made to rep resent him instead of Jehovah. The Bible says tha: Satan is “the god uf this world”. Ind^eu be is a god, a mighty one; but he is not the kind of god that I want to worship. He is responsible for all the sickness, sorrow, pain, erring and death in all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Learning to Knoio Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">rPHE Bible tolls us that the knowledge (or reverence) of God is the beginning of wisdom. It calls the people fools who say that there is no God. ‘This is life eternal, to know the only true God, and. His Son Jesus Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have you looked into the heavens late in the evening, just before going to bed, and there seen the beautiful little stars twinkling and winking at you? Of course you have I Do you know who made them? Satan did not make them, did hef Of course not!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do you know who made the sun and the moon, and tins big world on which we live, with all of its comforts and blessings? Do you know flat the good Lord made these for you and for me and for our friends to enjoy? The Bible says that God made this earth to be inhabited by a race of perfect, happy human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah therefore made it for us; and He also placed the big, bright sun where it would shin® on the earth to make it warm, so that the flowers, the berries, the fruit, the gr^en trees, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">gardens</span><span class="font5"> and the grass would grow and make aU nature glad with their beauty and fragrance? and furnish us ■with, all good things to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He also sends the rain to make the crops grow, ^nd He gives us cotton and wool for our clothing, and lumber and other materials with which to build our homes. In fact, He gives us everything that is ‘needed to make us happy. He is going to do many other wonderful things for mankind in the future. Do you not think that we should be very thankful to God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I wish I had more time in which to tell you about God, because I am sure that you want to know more about Him. We could not expect? however, to learn all about Him in one lesson, but we learn more about Him as we study the Bible. Some other time I will tell you some in.* terebting stories found in the Bible, which will make you love God all the more.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">(Ninth Study) The Third God</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">35. The angels of heaven are powerful beings. They are spirit beings, like Jehovah. That Is, we cannot see them, because they are made differently than we. They have marvelous bodies which enable them to pass through the great spaces of the universe much faster than the very fastest airplane can travel through the sir of our earth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">46. They were created by the Logos, too, and are called sons of God, because they are bright and shining like Him. We know that there is only one firstborn Son of God, however, and this is Jesus. The angels are used by Jehovah as messengers, and very good ones they make. They are always on hand to protect those who love God from anything that would seriously harm them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">47. We must remember, however, that the power possessed by the angels is given to them by God; and the good angels are continually praising God and glorifying His name in gratitude for this gift of power. But there are some bad angels, too—did you know that? Yes, indeed; but they were not always bad.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">48. The smartest and most beautiful of the angels was named Lucifer. He had many names of honor given to him by God. Once God called </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> “the anointed cherub that covereth”. So we see that Lucifer was placed over certain of the other creatures as a sort of guardian, to look after them. Lucifer was made a sort of third god at the time man was created.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">49. When roan was created, God sent Lucifer to the garden of Eden, to watch over him, and to be a messenger between earth and heaven. Lucifer saw the beautiful earth, with the perfect </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font5"> upon it; but instead of feeling grateful to God for giving him this great trust, he began to think up schemes to get the earth and everything on it all for himself, so that he might be as powerful as God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">50. Have you not heard of people being &quot;too smart”? That means that they think they know everything; and they act very stuck up and silly about it W ell, LHeifer was not only smart, but he was “too smart”, and he began to think that K® was as mighty as God Himself. In fact, the Bible tells us that he said, <sup>£</sup>T </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font5"> be Ek® the Most High.” Is that not terrible? To think of anyone trying to be as great as the great Je-hovah!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">51. Tins was the beginning of wrong and evil in the world. Up till now everything had gone smoothly for Adam, the first man. But when Lucifer, the Guardian Angel, became so anxious to be like God, he set temptations in the way of Adam., and Adam broke a rule which God had made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">52. Lucifer was then given several new names, not at all glorious, which served to show how bad he had become. He is now known as the Devil, the Dragon, the Serpent, the Adversary, the Enemy, and Satan. He is also called the “Father of Lies”. That he was once a very high being is proved by what God said of him: “Thou wast perfect in all thy ways until iniquity [evil] was found in thee.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Questions ®n Ninth Study</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font5">49. What important mission did Lucifer have respecting the earth? What effect did this have upon hi® pride? What effect should it have had?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Is there such a thing as being too smart? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Did </span><span class="font5">Lucifer become too smart? What foohJii idea earn© into his mind?</span></p>
