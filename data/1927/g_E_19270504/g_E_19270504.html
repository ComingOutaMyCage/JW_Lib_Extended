<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark8"></a>A Glimpse at the Giants</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font6">HE giants in the earth today are the public service corporations. In one way or another they affect e,very home in the land. The water that we drink, the lights by which we see to read, the gas that cooks our meals, our trolley service, telephone service, telegraph service, and the power that runs our domestic and factory machinery come to us from the public service corporations. So let us take a glimpse at them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Giants have small beginnings, and this is especially true of the electric giant. It was in 1824 that Faraday began his experiments to see if electricity could be produced from a magnet. It was thirty years before his experiments were crowned with complete success, and it was not until 1881 that electricity was for sale to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">New’ York's first public electric supply station was erected by Edison in Pearl Street, in 1881. Iri operation began on September 4th, 1882, with fifty-nine customers; and so skeptical were those that service was furnished to them for ths<sup>1</sup> first five months without charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foundation for the enterprise was the in-en descent electric light, invented by Edison hiimelf. Tt consists of a slender platinum or tungsten filament looped in a vacuum ■within a glass bulb. The filament is so slender that it offers great resistance to the passage of the electric current and convert s the electricity into heat and thus into light. The vacuum is necessary to prevent the destruction of the filament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Five years after the inshdlatmn of the first Edison station there were 103 electric companies in existence and 313,000 lamps in use. Today there are more than 6.000 companies, serving 16,700 communities; and the number of lamps used each year is put at 200,000,000. One-half of all the homes in the country are now wired for electricity, and this particular giant was said to be worth over $7,350,000,000 at the beginning of 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the year 1919 the total output of electricity from all public utility plants in the United States was 38,921,000,000 kilowatt hours. Four years later it was 55,928,000,000 kilow’att hours. About- thirty-five percent of the power is derived from waterfall, and sixty-five percent is derived from fuel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Growth of the Electrical Giant</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IVE years ago—and five years is a long time in the electrical world-.......the Smithsonian In</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270504_files/g_E_19270504-2.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">stitution Bulletin set forth that to accomplish the work done annually in the United States would require the labor of about twice as many people as there are now living in the whole world; so that, for all practical purposes, the use of power has given each man, woman and child iil the United States the use of thirty servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course not all power in the country is electrical power, but much of it is. An item from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Manufacture rs’ Record</span><span class="font6"> states that if every man in the United States worked eight hours a day their combined physical effort would be equal to less than one-fifth of the electrical energy produced from central stations alone. Coal burned to produce electricity gives three times as much power as the use of it to produce steam power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the United States has been progressing electrically, other countries have also 'been forging ahead in the use of this commodity. Out of a total of 115,000,000,000 kilowatt hours of electrical energy produced in the world in 1920 the United States produced only a little over one-third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Switzerland has the largest electrical consumption per capita of any country on earth. In Sweden, where electric power is cheap, farmers and housewives have far more bulbs in use per capita than in the United States;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">•48S </span><span class="font6">the deetiSed Ws are small, because the Swedish people are economical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">la Swedish elides the halls of apartment houses are dark, except for a few carefully measured nrirmtes after a person steps into them. The act of opening the door to step into them puts on the lights for a long enough period to enable a person to reach the top floor and no more. If he lingers on the way he finishes his journey in the dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finland, which is a thinly settled country, is electrified throughout, greatly to the benefit of its farming population. Progress is also being made in the electrification of Russia, despite the setbacks and the shortage of money. In the country districts it is not uncommon for a peasant when he gets an electrical shock to summon a priest to exorcise the demon with prayer and holy water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The electrifying of the world is making such .great demands for supper that fears have been expressed lest the voitfs supply of the metal would give out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T£e </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Advent of Super-Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TpOR many years after electricity had been demonstrated to be a most invaluable servant for man it was impossible to carry the current but a short distance, but when it was discovered that by using high voltages the current could be carried almost anywhere it was evident that a new era had dawned in the history of man on this planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the^aost natural thing conceivable that the large points should buy up the small ones in their vicinity, and then that the large ones should connect with one another and merge their services and their financial interests; and it was inevitable that some day some man would conceive a plan for a single electric superpower system to cover all of the United States and Canada. Such a plan now exists. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Preliminary to the greatest of all super-power systems there are already four enormous electrical combinations, one owned by the Province of Ontario, and run for the benefit of the people of Ontario, and three in the United States, run for profit; and, to quote Mr. Vanderbilt, “the public be damned*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is one super-power system covering Alabama, the Carolinas and Georgia; another covering seven states adjacent to Illinois; and a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">third covering the whole Pacific Coast and eastward into Montana. The equipment for hooking up New England and the Middle Atlantic States is about finished, and the big bankers are now fighting to see who shall have the biggest piece of the pie. Meantime the public know that they will get the erusts. Their only hope is that the cook will leave out the hair. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have before us a map of the proposed super-power system of the United.States and Canada. It shows, in outline, the location of all the coal fields; and, by means of circles shaded black, the estimated waterpower available in every part of the country is indicated. The final hook-up it is estimated will cost about $5,000,000,000. At the right time the people's savings (invested in .life insurance) rill be used to turn these properties over into the hands of the big bankers to run as they see fit</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The two big dynamos, 60,000 kilowatts each, built by the General Electric Company for flic Niagara Falls Power Company and the Commonwealth Edison Company of Chicago, will each do the work of 5,400,000 men working in three eight-hour shifts. The main power line between Chicago and Pittsburgh carries 132,000 volts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Supe^-Power</span><span class="font6"> Mop Be a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Great Blewiag</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">GOOD giant who will do almost anytliing on earth that you want done is a good thing;</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270504_files/g_E_19270504-3.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">and there is but lit^e that Super-power cannot do. Ue can increase the produetiiveness of farms, improv® transportation, reduce the cost of manufactured products, promote mining and metallurgical operations, increase the effectiveness of human labor, conserve fuel resources and distribute the population. The benefits conferred will be innumerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Super-power can restrain his own ravenous appetite for profits he can put electric fans, electric irons, electric toasters, electric cleaners, electric percolators, electric washers and electric air heaters into every home, and electric refrigerators into most of them. If the giant wills it so, the temperature of every home can be maintained at seventy degrees winter and summer; and there will be no fires, no dust or di rt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the giant wills it so, he can warm the orchards in unseasonably cold weather so that no fruit will be Hasted. He can vibrate billions of germs out of existence and rid the world el rats, mice, and even flies by the simple process of electrocution. He can grow grass on lawns, restore hair to partially bald scalps, and literally save millions of farm vomen from working themselves to death—as they now do because they have duties to perform which he could do for them just as well as not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The giant is indifferent whether he clips sheep, milks cows, separates milk, churns butter, chops straw, cooks chops, runs a sewing ma-chiny or does a thousand and one other tlrngs; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font6"> nd he can do the work quxekl, and v&lt;TL But he has h&gt;s troubles, too. Bats, niie<sup>0</sup>, squmiei, rad birds often put a plant out of coimni^S'o’i; opossums have done it; nionkexs have done it. And women oiten burn up their homes, themselves and their children, because they fail to turn him away from the electric iron af&lt;er he has done his vork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the cities he is much admired. On the Great White Way, New York City, there are numerous buildings where the use of the roof for sign purposes brings in a higner rental than the ground floor. One company pays $800,000 y early for the rental of electric sign space on Broadvray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The giant has some curious problems to solve in getting his wires where he wants them. While electing a imv organ at Kirkwall, Scotland, the cl,(tricians were confronted vith the problem of getting an electric cable through a twrive-inch pipe, sixty feet long, Lent at right angles in the middle. A small dog was placed at one eml of the pipe, villi a string attached to his collar. His master went to the other end and c 11 d to 1 mi (Hon &gt;h the 'i ’&gt; *; and along mine the dog, the string, and finally the cable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">/J„:’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">S +.’rr'js the Gscs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ryiffri </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">lle^alltc</span><span class="font6"> tel's us that ‘The sTaro--2- bolder? in. ten ] ubl e ut’litv conqvjm * in PeimsyIvania owned in 1920 slock worth $<sup>;</sup>52,-204 rflr.75, judpod by the mornei value of t' w stock rt the higne-t prices emoted for it in that year. The same rtock, plus the new sanies accruing to its owners through splitting up or stock dividends—but not ireludnig new shaios sold by the companies or exchanged for valuable considerations—was north, al the highest market quotations of 1925, $450,459,235.00, or 195.96% in five years.” The giant surely lias an enormous appetite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Governor Pinchot, of Pennsylvania, was so impressed with the super-power situation that lie said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No one vlio studios the electrical developments already achieved and those planned for the immediate future can doubt that </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font4">unified electrical monopoly extending into e\ery part of this nation is inevitable in. the icrt near iutuie. The question befoie iu i» tint vluthei there shall be such a monopoly. That wo cannot pi meed. The question is vhethei we shall legulate it &lt;&nbsp;■ vl. the r it shall regulate us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To much for vhat they think about the way tilings are going in Pennsylvania. Now lot us take a look at New York State. Perhaps there i» a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">r;ood</span><span class="font6"> giant there. Probably the bankers there are honest. But see what is .-aid by Justice f ord, who for five years served as state senator at Albany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In my expetience I have found the public service coiporahony the sheet railroad, the telephone, the lighting (ompanies m particular, to be the most piolnc source of political corruption in the state. They are moie d'lecth dependent upon goxmim ' tai fmois thin any othem, and indeed the profits of then bu ino-s fiow ftom the spatial pnwleaes which thex pmcuie aw<sup>1</sup> bold fiom the government, both state and municipal. In mv day at Albairy the-.o corporations plied tin ir i.efaiiuus bu'inc&quot;s of coiruptmg the people's repn. entatues so openb. that a bind deaf mute could bain what i cs going on. Not that legal evidence could he found agam-t them. They were too shrewd for that. But eveiv public man llieie was morally certain as to what wa« going on, am i’i pinaie eonvematiou it was freely tailed about. Time public seiv.ee corporations pollute the- voiy fountains of pul lie virtue; they debauch oui pu'ihc sonant-; they sub ubze paitv oiiamzitions for their o«n pui-po-&lt;&gt;- 111 the pm ns o&quot; gmc’umont are subtAe I to l'&lt; n I i-o cm<sup>1</sup>®, and govcirimmt or the p<sup>p</sup>op e, by the p ■ p x * e ; v&lt; <sub>x</sub>.e. i- mrde a । lock .y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To’v do d'p public service corporations con-br-’c- to w?J b'jch fabulous profits ami keep the poor le r I b ui legislatures quiet? The answer is fo ’n </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&gt;p f _ wirevd comment of a prominent ihr&gt;ji&lt;’iy m i al, that “one utility company has erimim . (li-w if ten peieent of the citizens of a conn amity ovn its securities, it is practically immune ibom ‘unfair’ legislative trea*merit”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This i ■&gt; the reason vhy all public service corporations offer stock for sale at such attractive prices. It is not because they need the money, but because they want greed to shut the mouths of the buyers. It is estimated that 7,000,000 citizens of the U. S. have invested in the se-eurities of the electric light and power industry, and in other public service corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Remedy of Public Ownership</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font6">BVIOUSLY if you hire a giant or any other kind of servant, and he turns out to be a thief, the thing to do is to take his powers away, if you can, and give them to somebody who you know, even with your Teapot Dome experience, is not any more crooked, and whom yon can manage. On this point the Public Owneiship League of Chicago say. s:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It would electrify the railroads, trebling their carrying capacity and reducing the cost of transportation.

<p><span class="font6">Cleveland has two electric lighting plants, one privately owned and one owned by the city. Until 1920 the private plant charged ten cents a kilowatt hour and claimed that it could not do this for less. The city plant charges three cents a kilowatt hour; and for six years the private plant has been charging only half its former rate, to prevent extension of the city-owned lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Muscatine, Iowa, also has two electric lighting plants, one privately owned and the other owned by the city. The same thing took place there. The municipal plant reduced the rate from twelve and one-half cents to seven cents; and although the private plant stated that they were losing money at twelve and one-half cents they nevertheless reduced their rate to seven cents and stayed in business. Further similar illustrations are cited by the Public Ownership League of America, 127 North Dearborn St., Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Electric Railway Giant</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font6">T HAS gotten into the histories that the first electric railway was operated in Richmond, Va., in 1888; but you cannot get anybody in Scranton, Pa., “The Electric City,” to believe it; for they well remember the original “People’s Line” operated in that city in July, 1886, two years before the Richmond venture. By 1890 there were 8,123 miles of single track electric railways in the United States. By 1912 there were 41,065 nrles. There has been no growth to speak of since that, time, on account of the phenomfinal development of the automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The electric railway is an essential of every large city. In the largest cities it is forced into the air or under the ground; but it is there nevertheless, and must remain as long as the city remains, for it is the way by which the masses must ever get to and from their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The elevated lines came first; and although they are cheaper to build and have light and ventilation which the subways lack, they are unsightly to look at (unnecessarily so); and because they are slower than the subways they are unpopular. The public craves speed, and is willing to be crowded to suffocation to get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the elevated, surface and subway lines of Greater New York about 2,700,000,000 fare-paying passengers are carried annually. Half of these are now carried underground; but twenty years ago there were no subways at all. The records show that each New Yorker rides 456 times a year. The New York subways are claimed to be the safest passenger-carrying railways in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An engineer of prominence, R. P. Bolton, has proposed an entire new system of subways for New York. His lines would be 400 feet beneath the surface of the city, without any curves at all, and trains running sixty miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font6"> gives us something to think about when it says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is an extraordinary amount of swift railroading done underground in New York City without casualties. The number of trains run to the hour and the numbers of passengers handled stagger the layman’s imagination, yet it must not be forgotten that no amount of efficiency and speed could make up for the sort of accident that could happen </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font4"> some trainman .should take a chance and something should break or burn out at J ust the wrong moment. Because the subway expresses run with great momentum, because they carry huge overloads of human life, because escape from the tunnels is difficult and because the third rail is always at hand to start a fire in case of a smash-up, a real subway disaster would be an appalling affair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Up-Keep of the Subways</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">milE management of the subways take no -*• chances, and it is well that they do not. On an ordinary railway the rails last about ten years. On the subways the rails are replaced every three years, and on the sharp curves they are replaced every ninety days. This work is done at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conditions may be a little better now, on account of more drastic legislation; but as late as three years ago the subways and elevated stations were gathering in $900 a day in counterfeit coins and slugs dropped into the turnstile slots instead of the nickels due. A device is also in use which automatically determines if the coin used has the required ninety-eight percent nickel; and if it does not, the arms of the turnstile turn half way, so as to catch the nickel-nurser redhanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Electric railways are worked for damages oftentimes when they should not be. On one occasion two Philadelphia men were discovered working in partnership. One went ahead and dropped banana peelings, while the other followed, slipped on the peel, and sued for damages. They had worked the scheme successfully in. other cities, but were caught when they tried to work it in their home town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the subway of Madrid a second-class oneway fare is fifteen centimes, or three cents; a round trip is twenty centimos, four cents. A first-class one-way fare is twenty centimos and a round trip is thirty centimos, six cents. The tubes are lighted throughout; and, if the current is cut off, the batteries in the ears are so strong as to enable them to run the cars for an hour longer. In Paris the men lift their hats to the women when they enter a street car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The street railway system of Glasgow, owned by the city, is claimed to be the most successful municipal concern in the world. The Detroit street railway system is also owned by the city and operated successfully. There are still a few trackless trofieys in the vicinity of New York, but they have mostly been superseded by busses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The C'tis Water Supply</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270504_files/g_E_19270504-4.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">OR some unknown reason most cities have had sense enough to own and ran their own water works. In the United Spates about seventy percent of the wader works are municipally owned. The remaining thirty percent are in private hands, with investments running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cities of ancient time obtained their water by gravity : Jerusalem from Siloam, Hebron and Bethlehem.; Athens from Mounts Hymettus and Pentelicon; Rome from the spurs of the Ap-penines. Three of the nine original aqueducts which supplied ancient Rome with water still supply the model n city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several of the greatest cities of the world still receive their wmter .supplies by the ancient gravity method. Among these are London, Manchester, Glasgow, New York. Boston, Rochester, Baltimore, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Paul and Los Angeles. Los Angeles gets its supplies from the Sierras, 235 miles away; and San Francisco from a similar source 154 miles distant. New York draws its water supplies from the Catskill mountains, on the opposite side of the Hudson River, 150 miles away. Tulsa, Oklahoma, goes sixty miles for its water supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although New York has only just finished its $80,000,000 Catskill water project, yet it faces a certain -water famine in another ten years unless additional supplies are obtained. A treaty is now being negotiated between New Jersey and Pennsylvania which will permit the use of flie headwaters of the Delaware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cities of Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Louisville, O-maha, Kansas City and Minneapolis draw water from elevated reservoirs filled by force pumps. Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee draw from standpipes filled in the same manner. The cities of Indianapolis, Dayton and Columbus get their water from wells beneath the cities and pump it directly into the mains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Gas Giant</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HUIE last giant that we shall consider in this article is the gas giant. The first use of coal gas for lighting and heating is ascribed to William Murdock, an Ayrshire Scotsman, who distilled gas from coal and lighted his offices and workmen’s cottages at Cornwall, in 1792. Exhibitions of such lighting had been made by Lord Dundonald in Cnlross Abbey five years earlier. The first English gas illuminating company was incorporated in 1812, and in four years London streets were generally illuminated by that method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Foi’ a hunciied yeais after the first production of artificial gas it was necessary to run gas works by a start and stop method. Five or ten minutes were used in making gas, and then the gas making must be stopped while the device was reheated. But now, by the use of electric heaters, the required temperatures can be maintained pennanently and gas making is continuous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first gas company in the United States was chartered in Baltimore in 1816. In 1822 the city of Boston adopted gas lighting. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tn</span><span class="font6"> New Orleans, in 1840, gas was seven dollars a thousand. cubic feet. It has been as low as eighty, cents and is now around $1.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are 966 companies in the United States supplying manufactured gas, fifty-one of these being municipally owned. Gas is used for 5,000 purposes. It is passing out as an illirminant, but is increasingly necessary in the arts. To make the artificial gas consumed in households and industry requires 8,500,000 tons of bituminous coal, 2,000,000 tons of anthracite coal, 1,500,000 tons of coke and 960,000,000 gallons of oil annually. New York consumes a quarter of all the artificial gas made in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A gas receiver consists of a huge cylinder, closed at the upper end and working up and down, either in several sections like a telescope or else with the lower rim in a tank of water. This cylinder stands in a circular frame. Cords from the cylinder run over pulleys and are weighted at the outer end. The gas is introduced into the cylinder from below, and is driven by the weight of the movable dome through the street mains and supply pipes. By changing the weights on the outer ends of the supporting cords, the pressure may be varied at will. As gas is manufactured the receiver rises, and during hours of consumption the receiver sinks. This is why the height of a gas house changes so surprisingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Illuminating </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ps= </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Heating Gas</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270504_files/g_E_19270504-5.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">HE gas companies would like to get rid of their illuminating business, and they are in a fair way to do it. Gaslight, although very satisfactory vrith a WeLbach mantle, is nevertheless hot and also consumes the oxygen which is needed for breathing purposes. It is dangerous, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Seeing that the lighting business is doomed, the gas companies would very much like to cheapen their me died of gas manufacture and sell so many thermal units instead of so many cubic feet of illuminating gas. Obviously a gas that is used only for cooking does not need any ill umi nating value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tn Scranton the gas company, perhaps to discourage the small user of illuminating gas, in grandiloquent language announced a reduction of rates from $1.50 to $1.15 per thousand on the first three thousand feet, with further reductions on larger usages. Then they added a fixed service charge of 75^ per month, so that the small user pays $1.90 for his first thousand, and if he uses two thousand it costs him $3.05. But before the “reduction” he would have paid only $3.00. Yet if he uses 2200 feet, which is more than a family on small income can afford, he makes the magnificent saving of two cents. Bates are graduated so that the largest users pay but sixty cents a thousand. This gas rate reduction was a fine thing for the rich; but it seems that the poor, as usual, merely get the privilege of paying the main part of the bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">W. E. Elliott, superintendent of the Struthers Furnace Company, Ohio, claims to be able to make 10.000.000 cubic feet of artificial gas at a cost of twelve cents per 1,000 cubic feet, and that the gas thus produced has a fifty-percent greater heating quality than other gas. The Doehler Die Casting Company, Brooklyn, N. Y., operating its own gas plant, asserts that it makes its own gas at a cost of forty cents per thousand cubic feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the states bordering on the Ohio River vast quantities of natural gas are piped to the homes of 2,600.000 domestic consumers and about 21,000 industrial or commercial consumers. This gas is macle by the Lord, and the only co-fi is for the piping, ft sells for around thirty-rive cents per 1000 cubic feet. Most of these artificial gas fields are expected to be exhausted in twenty years from now; but there is one field at Monroe, La., vliere it is calculated that there is still enough gas to supply 150,000,000 cubic feet a day for eighty-six years. The supply of natural gas is being exhausted with unnecessary extravagance, if not, in some instances, criminal negligence. But while it lasts it serves to curb the rapacity of the artificial gas giants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">TT IS interesting to know that nature has its own use for rubber. Its office is to save the rubber tree itself from destruction by insects. The rubber is carried in suspension between the outer and inner bark, and when an insect, bores through the outer bark he is a goner. The rubber exudes and provides him with a permanent, shroud and coffin. Moreover, the wound never cracks open but stretches easily as the tree moves this way and that in the breeze. Commercial rubber is obtained by artificially wounding the rubber trees.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">G</span><span class="font6">OOD evening, everybody. For about a year you have been kind enough to listen to my talks, in vhich I tried to explain some of the underlying principles of the science of chiropractic, supporting these explanations with specific instances of benefits resulting from chiropractic adjustments, and even remarkable cures which have been affected by the chiropractors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During these talks, there have been occasions when 1 called attention to antagonism aroused in some quarters against this health science. I have explained some of the general causes of this antagonism, chief among which is the general opposition encountered by any new idea, no matter how beneficial it may be to mankind or to society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such opposition need not be dwelt rpon here: for not merely in the healing art, but in every phase of human activity, the new tiling—the tiling that digresses or varies from the accepted mode of activity—is too often looked upon with suspicion. Despite such opposition, the science of chiropractic has achieved remarkable results. The beneficiaries of chiropractic, whose numbers swell into the hundreds of thousands, look with askance at opposition encountered by the chiropractors and are unable to account for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So it is that in line with the educational talks ou the 1’Ciui‘e, St-me, and nioamng of eiiiro-Bract'c, v? naturrllv poj.</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font6"> to *^0 problem of vhv ri iropiT'Wic should have engendered sucii antagonism, and why seme -'Tates throughout the country I ave declim .1 to i ■ ■ogmze the practitioners of this s-fimiee, de<sup>;</sup>mi e the remarkable evidence of benefits and cures received by patients from the practitioners of chiropractic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This problem brings us to a consideration, not of chiropractic, not of medicine, as it is practised by physicians using drugs and medicines, but of general medical and health activities throughout the United States, a subject, I feel sure, wliich ranks second to none in importance, to the lives of the people of this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The health of a nation is its greatest asset, as the health of the individual is his greatest asset. With our health we can fight our worldly battles. With our health each of us can meet and cope with the problems confronting us. With radiant health the vzorld is ours; but 'with our health impaired, we are not happy, not contented, not efficient, in our daily life and business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lienee the greatest good, the primary necessity for mankind, is health. And as it is the primary necessity for each individual, so the health of all individuals who collectively comprise the state, becomes paramount to the life and welfare of organized society. No matter how great the land, or how marvelously rich its resources, no nation without a healthy people can cope with the problems of life, can maintain itself or progress. Consequently, and I do not believe that anyone will disagree, there is no more important thing than the supervision of a people’s health; for upon such efficient awl beneficent supervision, the nation itself depends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Disraeli, considered by many as England’s gi-eatest statesman, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PiibLc health is the foundalion upon winch reposes the happiness and power of a country. The care of the p ’bhr health is the &quot;i ,t duly el a mmwian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">William Howard Taft, thief Justice of tlm United States Supreme Court, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The c&lt;ne of th&quot; md'vidual and family health, is the that and mod patriotic duty of a citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I could present quotation after quotation from famous authorities from all civilized lands, from all walks of life, all of whom agree upon this great fundamental principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second subject upon which thinkers agree, one especially dear to the American people, is personal liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the social history of the world, we find all Sorts of governments, ranging from autocracies and monarchies to democracies. The world learns, often slowly, but it learns, and inevitably it chooses the system of government most just and most beneficial to the vast majority of mankind. By a study of this social history, we find that the experience of the vorld has been that democratic government, with, personal liberty as its chief feature, is the best system of government yet evolved. And, along with this evolution, civilized society lias come to realize that autocracy is the worst system of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We now have two major premises: One, that the health of a nation’s citizens is its greatest concern; and two, that any form of autocracy is obnoxious to a liberty-loving people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With these two premises in mind, it comes as a shock to learn that the health of the people of the United States is in the hands of a medical trust, exercising its activities in an astounding-ly autocratic manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not my object to attack this autocracy; for in many places it is entrenched legally. My object is merely to present facts showing just what this medical trust is, how it is organized, how it operafes, and how it exercises its authority in controlling your health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You have probably read in your local newspapers of the activities of Amur state board of health, or of your local health department. You have all read of the prosecutions of men alleged to have been practising medicine without a license. The papers have called such men ‘■quacks'’, and the public has been led to believe that these prosecultd men are of the quack type, leeches that sirnk upon the blood of the hd pirns sick. But f’ c truth is that in most cases, the e mmy prow cult d for praeti -ing without a liwmm, am merely wibw; is of another I ealth science, smh as cairopracdc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In ord; i i’mt you <sup>T</sup> have a clear notion of the wav in v.hi?1&gt; the medical tru.fi operates, and precisely how it controls pour health, it is necessary that I sav a few words which more specifically point out what is commonly known as the medical trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The control of the health and the lives of most people in the United States is in the hands of members of a private corporation, incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois as the American Medical Association. The national headquarters of this association is at 535 North. Dearborn St., Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This private corporation has about 90,000 out of the approximate 150,000 physicians in the United States, as its members. Since this private corporation began an intensive campaign some twenty-five years ag-o to achieve a monopoly over health and medical matters throughout the country, individuals and corporations have raised the cry that it tended to operate as a monopoly in the control of medical matters, in the dictating to the American people just what they might and what they might not do in matters concerning their own health. But these individual fears, though expressed in an evermounting protest, brought little results in legal activity to curb this monopoly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That any private corporation with power to control the health and life of any citizen is a menace is too self-evident to need further explanation ; but that this private corporation proceeds to use its tremendous power to eliminate competition, appears to be a violation of the anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws, enforced by both the federal and state governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This private corporation, the American Medical Association, is composed of “component” parts, known as state medical associations. These state medical associations are the chief branches through which this corporation does its work. The state medical societies, in turn, are subdivided into county medical societies, which carry on their activities locally. All of these various component parts of the hug*e national organization handle specific fields of work, such as propaganda on health matters, legislative woik, and so on. There is scarcely a solHary thing related to public health which this corporation does not absolutely control through its irem'wrslr’p or tlnough influence indirectly in a controlling degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a private corporation attains such terrific power, it becomes essential to consider the motives that actuate the activities of such a corporation. In the specific ease of the American Medical Association, as in most huge corporations, the chief objective is self-interest. Krom the very day that the American Medical </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">As</span><span class="font6">-soeiation was conceived, its chief purpose was to protect the financial interests of its members by cornering the practice of healing the sick. That purpose still dominates its activities today, though the years have taught this organization the wisdom of concealing its real purpose under the blank phrases of being active for “public welfare”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is this effort to corner the practice of healing the sick which makes this organization one to be viewed with concern by the people throughout the United States; for though monopolies are abhorrent to the people, a monopoly upon the healing art is one that carries with. it too grave a menace, to the welfare of the people to bo lightly dismUsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Win n I say that the purpose of the American Medical Association was to function chiefly for the u mrtsts of its members, it is a statement v J&gt;p '&gt; no-'ds proof, and one which brings us back a 1 n to the ^aily days of the organization of ib'ctom which developed into the American kb dienl Association.</span></p>

Tlmy decided to organize a society to be known the Ameiimn Medical Association, with the j n,pose of “exciting and encouraging emoluments” lor the regular physicians. I am quoting now from tie original resolution passed by this fii st convention, and this purpose is worthy of repetition, so let mo repeat: The purpose was ‘the exciting and encouraging emoluments” for tlm irgdar M.

<p><span class="font6">&quot;The objeeth of this Association shall be to federate into one compact organization the medical profession of the United States” and “of safeguarding the material interests of the medical profession”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So we see that from the very day of its birth to the day it was incorporated, and down to this very day, among the chief objects of this association was the bettering of the financial condition of its members, or to express it as they did, “to safeguard the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">material interests </span><span class="font6">of the medical profession”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “material interests” of the medical profession naturally can best be safeguarded if the medical profession is the only controlling factor in treating the sick. Consequently, the next step becomes obvious to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For those members of the Medical Science belief Ing in the use of drugs, pills, and other such mt7ns of alleviating or curing the ailments to winch mankind is subject, the important thing was to eliminate from the field of practice such exponents of the healing art that disagreed with its methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let me illustrate. Some thirty years ago, chiropractic was offered to the world. It was a method depending entirely upon a philosophy, science, and art of things natural: a system of adjusting the articulations of the spinal column, by hand only, for the correction of the cause of disease. It is not my object at the present time to go into a detailed exposition </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> chiropractic. I merely mention this science as one known to almost every man and voman in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Patients came to chiropractors; often patriots with ills and diseases given up as hopeless by the practitioners of the regular system of medicine, or those believing in the use of drugs and medicines. And ibe records ‘-’how that chiropractic accomplished astonishing results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So swiftly did chiropractic become kw&gt;wn, that many thousands of chiropractors began to piactlso throughout foe eoumiy. Million.- of men and wonmn wmfl to them, seok’iw ’•eb'*f. Some thirty stab ? 1&lt; iceogirzeJ &lt;&nbsp;}i j'lpiao-tic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fees for treating the mik went to chiiopiactors instead of to reg dor physicians, and the benefits of chiropractic became eo pronounced, so many thousands preferred ihfo science, that the loss of income by the regular doctors, die drug and medicine prescription signers, declined noticeably. If a chiropractor opened au office in any city, the patients that came to him reduced the income received by the regular AI. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The American Medical Association, the state medical societies, the county medical societies— all of the regular medical societies—perceived that the sick were showing preference to this new method, and decided that something should be done to curb those practitioners who were interfering with their incomes, and to put them out of business, if possible, and so have less competition in the business of healing the sick. With chiropractors and practitioners of other methods eliminated, the regular doctors would be in sole control of the field and consequently suffer no financial loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So we see that in the business of healing, as in any business, financial interests are often the instigators of otherwise inexplicable acts. In this particular case, the chiropractors who opened offices throughout the United States severely interfered with and hampered the financial returns of the regular M. D.s’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this period, however, as will be explained in a later talk, the American Medical Association had already achieved a virtual monopoly over the practice of the healing art in most States throughout the country. Most state and local boards of health are composed of members of this private corporation; and with the influence they could bring to bear upon local and state legislatures, it was not difficult to secure the enactment of laws preventing chiropractors from practising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AVe thus see how it works. Because the chiropractor, offering a method which produces remarkable results, and which with each passing day adds recruits to its banners, the financial incomes of the regular physicians are interfered with; and through their organizations, the regular- M. D.s’ take steps to make it illegal for the chiropractor to practise. By thus making it illegal, the chiropractor is eliminated from competition, and the regular doctor is left free to continue his practice undisturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This very brief outline is sufficient, I hope, to give my listeners a notion of the reasons why there has been such antagonism against the chiropractors by the Ai. D.s’. The American Medical Association, naturally, as representing about 90,000 M. D.s’ has taken an active interest in eliminating chiropractors from the field of! practice in the healing art. It has been forced to this activity because of one of the fundamental clauses in its articles of incorporation; namely, to safeguard “the material interests of the medical profession”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hence we find, as I hope to explain in a succeeding talk, that the American Medical Association, through its national headquarters, and through the headquarters of the various state medical societies throughout the United States, and through the; local county medical societies, is carrying on a bitter campaign for the suppression of chiropractic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact is, my friends, that nothing which the public finds it does not want, can long exist. You may be able to convince the public that a certain thing is of benefit to them, but unless it carries merit within itself, merit that stamps it as a necessity to the people, the public will turn from it sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chiropractic is not one of those things from which the people turn. Millions have found it the one thing beneficial to them; the one thing that has helped them when the drug and medicine doctors failed to produce any results upon their pain-racked bodies. They have sent their friends to chiropractors. Some 20,000 chiropractors are practising throughout the country today; and if there is no merit in chiropractic, the chiropractic practitioners would long since have vanished from the face of the earth. But it has survived thirty years of intensive attack; and today the regular physicians are driven to efforts to legislate it out of existence, and thus protect themselves from the financial inroads made by those practitioners, into the M. D.s’ incomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In other words, they are trying to legislate something out of the lives of the people which the people want, and no such law can be enforced. The people have an inalienable right to seek tt.e help of those healers in whom they have faith; and to them they will continue to go, whether they be exponents of the regular system of medicine or whether exponents of any other method.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">LTj the peoples of earth may he divided into two general classes, to wit, the rulers and </span><span class="font6">the lulecl. The ruling class is made up of three elements; to wit, the commercial, political, and religious. For centuries these three have formed an alliance and claimed the right, to rule mankind. There is frequently a clash between the raters and the ruled. Tinder right conditions this should not be so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ruling class has the desire to keep the people in subjection and under control, and to accomplish this desired purpose they make claims of their special ability to govern. The commercial giants of the earth in substance say: “Give us greater wealth and power, and we will, improve conditions and make the earth a fit place to live on. We provide all the great </span><span class="font3">Diego, Calif., by Judge Rutherford.] </span><span class="font6">labor-saving devices, the means of rapid transit, and means of education; and therefore we should guide the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The political element says: “We possess superior qualifications for ruling. We organize and maintain governments. We enact wholesome laws. We safeguard the liberties and property of the people and they should patriotically follow our lead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The religious element, of which the clergy is in the lead, says: “We interpret the divine will. To us is granted the privilege of advising mankind concerning spiritual matters. We will do your thinking for xou. If you join our church and go with us you will go to heaven. If you do not join us, then you will go to hell and roast for ever in fire and brimstone.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">1IESE three elements aforementioned constitute vhat the Scriptures declare to be ■“he world” that is risible.. “World” means mankind organized into forms of government under the supervision of an invisible overlord. The invisible overlord of this world, one who has been for centuries, is Satan the Devil. the Lord so deciares in His Word in 2 Corinthians 4: 3. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The common people, who really produce the wealth of a nation, know from experience that the claims of the governing factors are not true. Knowing this their dheontent increase;'-. They see the rith becoming more avaricious and crushing out all competition and making it almost impossible for the smaller man to accomplish anything. Tbwy s^e that intrigue, duplicity and trickery are £i eely i c'-orted to by the professional politicians. They see the conflicting doctrines held iorth by the denominational church systems, and know tha( these cannot be in harmony with the truth because they are out of harmony with each. They observe the clergy, claiming to represent the Lord, uniting their forces with profiteers and bootloggers to fasten upon the people laws that are oppresstoe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Doubt and fear have taken hold upon mankind. The people in general are in perplexity and in distress. They see threatening another great war far more terrible and destructive than any war ever known. Desiring peace and hating war, they are compelled to contribute their money to prepare devilish and deadly instruments of destruction. They continue to suffer under the oppressive weight of high taxes, profiteers, politicians, and false religious leaders. They have reached their extremity.

<p><span class="font6">Naturally the people ask, Will these conditions ever be changed or must they go on for ever? I answer, They will change. The world has reached a climax, and the people an extremity. There has never been a time more opportune to call mankind’s attention to the great and wonderful plan of Jehovah which is now reaching a climax and which will result in good to mankind. This obligation was once laid upon the clergy; but being selfish and desiring the plaudits of men rather than the approval of God, they have united with world systems and have repudiated the great teachings of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I invite you now to a consideration of God’s provision for establishing in this earth a righteous government. A government of the people that exercises its powers unselfishly and functions in behalf of the general welfare of mankind has long been the desire of man. As the apostle puts it: And the whole creation hath groaned and travailed in pain till now, waiting for the manifestation of that righteous government.—Homans 8:22, 23.</span></p>

The great spirit being Lucifer, being made the oveilord of man, was the one who induced man to sin. At that time God changed his name to Satan, Dragon, Serpent, and Devil, but did not take from him the power to exercise influence over mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From then tin now Satan has been the invisible ruler of selfish men and the one who has oppressed mankind. Adam, being sentenced to death, and his children begotten thereafter, all Were born in sm and shapen in iniquity, (Psahn 51:5) For this reason all mankind have been born imperfect.

<p><span class="font6">ONG centuries ago God promised to redeem man from death and purchase him from the power of the grave. (Hosea 13:14) This redemption could be accomplished only by the death of a perfect man. To this end God sent Jesus into the earth to die in order that mankind might live. To this end it is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The Son of man came to give his life a ransom for many.” (Matthew 20: 28) He came that the people might have life and have it more abundantly. (John 10:10) He died upon the cross for the benefit of all men. (Hebrew’s 2:9) In due course of time all men must come to a knowledge of this truth. (1 Timothy 2: 5, 6) The time is at hand for this knowledge to be disseminated to the people. From the crucifixion of the Lord to the coming of His kingdom is the day of God’s preparation for the establishment of a righteous government on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 22:18) God organized the nation of Israel into a sample government foreshadowing His righteous government upon earth, lie caused His prophet to write concerning the coming of the great One who should deliver mankind these w<sup>T</sup>ords: &quot;The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.”-— Genesis 49:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To Moses Jehovah said that lie would raise up a mighty One, whom Moses foreshado’wed, and the people should hear and obey Him. That Go-d intended that this mighty One should be the Ruler of the world, and establish peace and prosperity and a government in the interests of the people, is clearly settled by the words of His prophet as recorded in Isaiah 9:6, 7:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;For unto us a child is born^ unto us p son m given: and the government shall be upon, his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”—Isaiah 9: 6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For four thousand years orthodox Jews have waited and hoped for the coming of their Messiah. For the past nineteen hundred years real Christians have waited and hoped and prayed for the coming of Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords. Why has this been in the minds and hearts of devout men? I answer: Because all the prophets foretold that the Messiah should bring blessings to the people through a righteous government. True Christians have had the same hope based upon the teachings of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Messiah and Christ mean the same, and both mean God’s anointed King. The question that has been uppermost in the minds of devout men and women for centuries has been and is: When will the time come for the establishment of God’s kingdom amongst men ? This question was propounded to Jesus just before His crucifixion, and He gave the answer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">HE question 1'ecorded in Matthew 24: 3, and which was propounded by His disciples is: “Master, tell us,... what shall be the proof of thy presence, and ol’ the end of the world/” They asked this question because they knew that when Satan’s world should end, Messiah’s world should begin; and that would mark the time for the establishment of a righteous government on ti e earth. “The pud of the world” does not mean the end of the earth: because God has declared. “The earth abidetli for ever.” He made the earth to be inhabited. He made it for man. End of the world moans the end of the reign of Satan by and through selfish men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Israel, which foreshadowed the righteous government, deflected and was cast away in 606 B. C. at the dethronement of Zedeldah, her last king. The Gentiles there were given uninterrupted sway for a period of 2520 years, as God foretold through His prophet It is easy to be seen, that a. period of 2520 years from 606 B. C. must end in 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now note what Jesus’ answer was concerning the end of the world, which would mean the beginning of a change of conditions. He said: “Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,” to be followed by famines and pestilence and earthquakes and revolutions in divers place, and these shall be the beginning of sorrows, marking the passing away of the old world.—Matthew 24: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The World War that began in 1914 was the only war in which nation arose against nation and every part of the nation was required to partieip&gt;ate. The famine and pestilence followed shortly thereafter, and there have been more earthquakes during the last ten years than in the history of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus furthermore said that the Jews would begin to be reg-athored to Palestine; and this is now an accomplished fact. Then He stated that at this time there would be upon earth distress of nations with perplexity and men’s hearts failing them for fear; and that is a condition exactly which we now see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Jesus stated that this good news must be told to the peoples of earth as a witness, and thereafter the final end of Satan’s empire would come. We are witnessing now the telling of this message to the peoples throughout the earth, not for the purpose of converting the world but for the purpose of serving notice upon the kings and rulers and the peoples of earth. That notice is that Jehovah is God, Chiist Jesus is King, and that God has set Ills King upon His throne, and there shall follow a righ.eous government in the interest of mankiiui.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s promises are sure. Having made them, in His due time He wiT carry them into operation. Tie lias said fteaiah 46:11), “I have spoken it, I will bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it”; (Isaiah 55:11) “Aly word shall not return unto rne void, but it shall accomplish that which I please.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now we not only see the nations of the earth in distress and perplexity following the great World War, but we know that there is a general condition of controversy amongst the kings and rulers of earth. God described, through His prophet Daniel, the history of the world leading up to this very hour, and then through his prophet Daniel said; “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven, set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thg Kingdom Come</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">G</span><span class="font6">OD’S kingdom or government will consist of Christ, the invisible Ruler of the new world, even as Satan has been the invisible ruler for centuries past. (2 Peter 3:13) Christ will have upon earth representatives, who are faithful and righteous men, who will look after the interests of the people and will see to it that the laws are acli -dnistered for the benefit of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without a doubt the distressed conditions of the peoples of earth are due to the fact that the world is reaching a great crisis which shall end, in the words of the Master, in a time of trouble such as the world has never known; and then immediately shall follow the complete establishment of God’s kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Scientists and savants are telling the people that the disturbed conditions of earth threaten to grow worse; but they know not the reason why. The real Scriptural reason is because a great dispensations! change is taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy have mistaught and thereby misled the people to believe that the only place of salvation for mankind is heaven, and that all but a few must go to hell-fire and brimstone. On the contrary God teaches that only the few faithful Christians will ever go to heaven and that the mass of mankind will have their eternal abiding place on earth in a state of happiness and peace. The clergy are not preaching the Bible to the people evidently because they do not know it themselves. They have been more interested in trying to make and enforce a prohibition law that they might pose before the people as great reformers rather than to proclaim God’s method of cleansing the nations and making the earth a fit place upon which to live. The bootleggers are the preachers’ chief allies in this. The Lord’s righteous government will clean up the world so that it will stay clean. Let the people now inform themselves. I invite you to make a note of the scriptures that I shall now cite with reference to a righteous government, and then study your Bible for yourselves and see the happy day held out for mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">JEHOVAH is God. Jesus Christ. His beloved J Son, is the Redeemer of man, and God’s anointed King. God has promised that with the end of Satan’s rule He will establish a kingdom for the benefit of man, and that this government shall not be left to others, and that it shall stand for ever. There will be no profiteers, no politicians, nor fal$e preachers in that government Christ the invisible King will rule, with His risible representatives on the earth acting under His direct supervision and control. “Behold, a King shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isaiah 32:1) The faithful men of old, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob resurrected as perfect human beings, will be the visible representatives or princes in the earth. —Psalm 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prince of Peace will be in control of that government, and of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end. (Isaiah 9:6,7) No more shall the people be ravaged by war; because, declares the Lord, when His kingdom is established the people “shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (Isaiah 2: 2-4) Through Messiah’s kingdom, and that alone, will the people realize their desire for an everlasting peace where they may dwell together and have no fear of war or of assault from their enemies. “But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree: and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it: For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.”—Micah 4:4, 5.</span></p>

God has promised that in His kingdom famines will be impossible. In the first place the profiteers will not be permitted to ply their business. Nothing shall hurt or destroy in all that holy kingdom. (Isaiah 11:9) The Lord will rule in righteousness, and with righteousness shall he judge the poor. (Isaiah 11:4) Then when the judgments of the Lord are in the earth the people will learn righteousness.—Isaiah 26:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They will learn to minister one unto another and to help one another. The Lord will furnish the people with, a means of eradicating the weeds and the thistles and thorns, that the earth may bring forth the things that they need. (Isaiah 55:13) Then the earth shall yield her increase. (Psalm 67: 6) “And in this kingdom shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things.” (Isaiah 25:6) “He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. The mountains [kingdom] shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righicmisness. Tie '-hall judge the poor of the people, he shall save th? children of the needy, ami shall break in pieces the oppressor. They shall fear thee as long as the snn and moon endure, throughout all generations. Ho shall come dov n like rain upon the mown grass: as showers tliat water the earth.

<p><span class="font6">EALTII is one of the things that the people have long desired. AH have suffered from lack of health. All the efforts that man has been able to pur forth have not brought lasting health to the people. There is nothing in the standards held up by the various systems or governments that contain any basis for a hope of health. Look now to the standard of the Lord and see what it promises to those that walk humbly before Him. The I ord says: “Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” (Jeremiah 23: 6) “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am. sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.”— Isaiah 33:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">L</span><span class="font6">IFE in a state of peace and happiness is the greatest desire of man. For sixty centuries the human family has been racked by disease, and billions have gone down in sorrow to the grave. All the schemes that men .have ever put forth concerning eternal life, all the statements upon the standard of men or proclaiming life, have been and are false. Satan declared that there is no death; and his representatives on earth have been preaching for centuries that man does not die. But human experience proves that this is entirely false. Why longer be deceived by the false standards of men! Turn now to the standard of the Lord and see what it holds as a hope for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus Christ declared: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3) Keep always in mind that originally GOD gave life to man, and that GOD took away that right to life because of disobedience. Remember then that GOD ALONE provided for the redemption of man from death and the grave, according to His promise; that these provisions for redemption are through the merit of the ransom sacrifice of the Lord Jesus; that GOD has appointed a day or period of time in which He will give all men an opportunity to reap the benefits of this ransom sacrifice and an opportunity to be rest ored to perfect human life. It is in the Messianic kingdom on earth that this opportunity shall be given to man; and this government is now beginning. The apostle states that the second coming and reign of the Lord is for the purpose of giving an opportunity first to the living and then to those that are dead; and that this opportunity shall be given in His kingdom. (2 Timothy </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4:</span><span class="font6">1) The kingdom is now<sup>T</sup> beginning, and that is why these truths are coming to the knowledge of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Job, in poetic phrase, describes the miserable condition in which man finds himself and shovs hov vain it is to folio v the standards of men; and then he turns his words to the Messenger of the covenant, namely, the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings. He shows that this great Messenger is the one among a thousand and altogether lovely, and that if man hears and obeys tins great Meswnger, who interprets and makes the Word of (tod plain, God then “is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit [grave]”; and the response of man is: “1 hare found a ransom.” Then what shall result to the one who is obedient and walks humbly before God? The prophet answers: “His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; he shall return to the days of his youth.”—Job 33:19-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those now residing on earth first having had their opportunity, then will come from the tomb those who have long slept in the dust of the earth. The Prophet Daniel, speaking first of the time when Michael the Christ, who stands up for the people, shall take His power and reign, says that then those sleeping in the dust of the earth shall awake. (Daniel 12:1,2) The Lord Jesus, referring to the same time, said: &quot;All in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth.” (John 5:28, 29) Again Jesus, speaking of the same time, said: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.”—John 8: 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is the positive saying that the man who obeys the Lord, walking humbly before Him, shall never die. But of course he must first come to a knowledge of the truth; and for this reason the truth is first testified to him. Then if he hears and obeys ho shall never die. Again the Lord Jesus said, referring to the same time: “And whosoever liveth and belleveth in me .shall never die.”—John 11: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people have been wicked all through the centuries because of the wicked influence of Satan the Devil. But Satan is to be restrained that ho may deceive them no more; and then the wicked man, turning to righteousness, shall live and shall not die. (Revelation 20:1-3) “When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Because he consideretli, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.”—Ezekiel 18: 27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because the time has come for the fulfilment of these great truths, because the Lord's kingdom is at hand, and because a generation of people exists upon the earth in ordinary times for fifty years or more, it may be confidently said that there are millions of people residing on the earth who shall Live for ever, being restored to a perfect condition of body and mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">L</span><span class="font6">IBERTY is one of the things that man has desired. He has always been in bondage to some kind of oppression. He has been in bondage also to the great enemy, sickness and death. The Lord Jesus Christ dedares that he who accepts and obeys the truth shall be set ' free; and when the Lord sets him free he shall be free indeed. (John 8:32) Here then is a basis for liberty people have so long desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What would bring lasting happiness to mankind ? I answer: A condition that would permit the people to enjoy peace, prosperity, health and everlasting life, and a government that would safeguard the common interests of all. Those arc the things guaranteed to the people by the Word of God. In that righteous government there will be no corporations, misnamed trust companies, that deal subtly and unjustly with the poor and unsuspecting; there will be no conscienceless politicians who misrepresent the people; and there will be no ambitious and selfish preachers who will misrepresent God and mislead the people. The invisible Ruler of that just government will be the beloved Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">h; beautiful poetic language God's Word describes that government of righteousness thus: “I save the holy city [righteous government] coming down from God out of heaven. ... I heard a great voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the dwelling place of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God liimsclf will be their God. And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither sha</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ll </span><span class="font6">there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more. He that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.” (Revelation 21:1-5) Then all will know that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King, and that all wlio do right will enjoy endless blessings under the righteous government of the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font6">F GENERAL interest to Bible Students all over the world is the letter which follows. The writer of the letter, Mr. E. W. Brenisen, was for many years General Secretary of the International Bible Students Association, and though now for many years occupying a responsible position in the great printing establishment which until recently printed much of our literature, his interest in the Lord’s cause is in no sense of the world diminished, but ’•ather increased. Mr. Brenisen realizes that Judge Rutherford has neither the time nor inclination to give attention to answering attacks of the nature indicated, and he has done a real service in sending us this letter. The author of the attack did not seem to learn the lessons taught by Numbers 12; 2 Samuel 6 and 2 Chronicles 26. Mr. Breniseris letter follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It seems to me that you have been in the Truth long enough to know that anyone as active in the service of the Lord as Judge Rutherford and Manager Salter would be the objects of all kinds of the Devil’s malicious charges.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Christ in the Book of Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[Radiocast from Station WBBR on a wave length, of 416.4 meters by the Editor.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font6">N TWO previous lectures we considered the subject of Christ in the books of Genesis and Exodus, and now we find Him in Leviticus also. We have already seen how Christ was represented in the Tabernacle in the Wilderness; in its Ark of the Covenant, and in the contents of that Ark—Aaron’s rod, the pot of manna, and the tables of the Law; in the candlestick, table and incense altar of the Holy; in the laver and brazen altar of the Court; in the gate, door and vail, and in the pillars and hangings, of the Tabernacle structure; in the sacrifices offered without the camp, as well as those offered in the Court, Holy and Most Holy; and finally in Aaron himself, in the clothing which he wore, every item of which, either in its use, materials, color or ornamentation, beautifully and appropriately represented something of interest in the past, present or future work of the Redeemer of men. These are the subjects also chiefly treated in the book of Leviticus; but we shall there find a few additional pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aaron and his successors in the office of high priest must be men without blemish. They could not have any physical defect—twelve possible defects are named, so as to make sure that God’s will in the matter should be clearly understood. This selection of an unblemished one as high priest points to the fact that Jesus, our great High Priest, was holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover, an Israelitish high priest could not take just any woman to be his wife. She could not be a widow, or a divorced woman, or a woman of coarseness, or a harlot; she must be a virgin. This represents that Christ Jesus, in selecting His church, &quot;the bride of Christ,” selects no church which, is contaminated by alliances with earthly governments or otherwise, but chooses only the wise virgin, the true church, whose one hope has always been to wait for the return of her Lord from heaven, and then to share with Him in. the work of healing and blessing the world of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Jubilee Picture</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font6">F ALL the grand pictures in the grandest of picture books, the Bible, perhaps the grandest of all is that afforded in the 25th chapter of Leviticus. There we are told that from the time that they should come into the land of Canaan the Israelites were to sow their fields and prune their vineyards for six years, but the seventh was to be a period of rest, both for the land and for the people living upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After seven of these periods of seven years had passed, there was a fiftieth year, styled the Year of Jubilee, which was ushered in on the tenth day of the seventh month, or about October 1st,' by the blowing of silver trumpets and the issuance of a most extraordinary proclamation. The day that the trumpet was blown was the day of atonement, the day when the sins of Israel were typically canceled, so that for the ensuing year they might have the right to approach unto God in His appointed way. The jubilee trumpet was blown toward the end of that day, after God had shown His acceptance of the atonement day sacrifices made by the high priest. The Scriptures phrase the. matter thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you: and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.”-—Leviticus 25: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this rvas a picture of the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the blessing that takes place upon the completion of that work of atonement. If a man incurred a debt of an}* kind, as soon as the jubilee trumpet sounded that debt was canceled. If through misfortune or ill management he had lost his home, when the jubilee trumpet sounded that home was restored to him or to his family. Even if he had been compelled to sell himself and his family into slavery, a*.hen the jubilee trumpet sounded the shackle of serfdom fell off and he and his family weie ptifecf-</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">]y</span><span class="font6"> free to come and s,o as they wished, and to return to tlte.li ancestial home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">LA us g<sup>!</sup> nee now at the stern reality. Jian i hmded db'Ui v rih a d( bt of sm an 1 impoifoc-ti.-.i L’chl&lt; c&quot;u never pa&gt;. Not onh is ho .-old into dawij, but all his near ones with him; all togeth. r ar<sup>n</sup> slipping and riming down tin broad way that leads to destruction--death and the tomb. The beautiful home w, Eden has been lost. No on&quot; in the sad procession i- able to step out of the line, much less to arrest the procession or to rescue another from it. All seem lost, and would be for ever lost but for the provision God lias made through Christ Jesus, the great High Priest and the great Restorer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In due time Christ died for the ungodly; in due time He gave Himself a ransom for all; in due time the atoning sacrifices are completed; in due time, and even now, before, in fact, the sacrificial work of the Priest is quite finished, the Jubilee trumpet has begun io blow, assuring mankind of the ushering in of a happier day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the debts of mankind are all to be canceled, including the greatest of all debts, the forfeiture of life itself due to sin. Now the lost home, represented by the garden of Eden, paradise 'world-wide, is to be restored. And now, best of all, the loved ones of the family—father, mother, sister, brother, and all others who have gone doAvn into the tomb—are to come forth and be restored to their loved ones, right here in this world where they had all their happy and unhappy experiences. Such is the plain teaching of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The basis for the provision respecting the land of Canaan is given by the Lord. Tie says in this connection: “The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine.” (Leviticus 25:23) Many people do not know this. They seem to think that man has the undisputed title to whatever land he can obtain possession of, but a little reflection shows the Lord’s absolute right to do vvitli the earth, or with any part of it, exactly as He pleases. From this point of view- man is a tenant on the estate of another, and an obligation rests upon him to do as the real Lord, the real owner of the land, may require. Moreover, the Lord has the ability to see to it that ITis wishes are carried out. None will live on His eLate*-* exrv-pt a&lt; He wills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AntiUjpe Now Due</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the most infereslii&lt;g and encouraging things about the jubilee arrangement is that the Scriptures snorv how many of the fifty-year jubilee periods vrouldpass before die great antitv pieal jubilee period should come. There 'were to be seventy intervening typical periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah foreknew&quot; that the Israelites would not Avidi to release their slaves, or cancel debts owed to them, or give up houses in which they had lived for a generation. He realized that the law of the jubilee, which required that these things should be done every fifty years, would be generally ignored, or, at the most, only partially observed In a half-hearted manner. Hence, lie caused all seventy of the jubilees to be observed at one time, by sending the Isr-i dites into captivity for as many years as there should be typical jubilees before the great antitype should come. This captivity was for seventy years, and is expressly declared to have come upon Israel for that purpose. We read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘•To fulfil the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths : for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.” (2 Chronicles 36:21) Jeremiah’s prophecies on this subject are to be found in Jeremiah 25: 9-12 and 29:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Israel entered into the land of Canaan in the year 1575 B. C., and the observance of the jubilees every fifty years dates from the beginning of that civil year, or from about October 1st, 1576 B. C. The total number of jubilees was to be seventy, which makes a grand total of 3,500 years. The aniitypical Jubilee would be due, therefore, 3,500 years after Oct. 1,1576 B. C., or about Oct. I, 1925 A. D.; and it is a very significant item that at that time the return of Jews to their promised land, Palestine, reachedits height. During that very year, 1925, more than 40,000 Jews returned to their homeland. This was as many as in the six preceding years put together. All this shows that the great Restorer is here, and that the “times of restitution of all things spr ran by the mouth of all the holy prophets” is upon us.—Acts 3:19-21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">All these calamities were designed to make the Israelites very careful in the carrying out of the jubilee arrangements; but if they should ignore all these acts of the Lord He assured them that He had one more punishment reserved, one that would be final because it would be effective. That punishment was, as set forth in the 26th chapter of Leviticus, a punishment of “seven times’’.— Leviticus 26:17, 18, 24, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These “seven times” are the same as “the times of the Gentiles”, elsewhere referred to in the Scriptures. (Luke 21: 24) Actually they are seven periods, each 360 lunar years in duration. A literal “time” or year was, with the Hebrews, a period of 12 months of 30 days each. In symbolic reckoning each day represents a year. (Ezekiel 4: 6) Hence the seven times of Israel’s punishment was a period of 7 x 360 or 2,520 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those seven Times of the Gentiles began to count when the typical kingdom of God was overthrown in the days of King Zedekiah, about August 1 st, 606^4 years before the beginning of our Christian era. They ended 19133,4 years later, or August 1st, 1914, the time of the breaking out of the World War. There the Times of the Gentiles ended; and although their rule continues temporarily, yet the right to rule has passed; and He whose right it is has come and is even now exercising dominion in the earth..</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Times of the Gentiles were to end when Christ should stand up and take to Himself His great power and. begin His reign. This we announce as an accomplished fact, lien do not see Him with their literal eyes, and they never will see TThn v.itli thm-e exes, m Hu Himself said.

<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font6">N PREVIOUS lessons we found out about the first human family; where they came from; the kind of home they lived in; and the many nice things they had to make them happy. We also learned about the first father and mother moving to a strange, wild country outside the garden of Eden, and about the biidhs of their little boys and girls. When the children of i lie fix st family were grown, they raised families ; and in time there were many families, all of whom were the children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and so on, of Adam and Eve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a sad fact that not all of these children were good boys and girls. It was Cain who killed Ills ovn brother, .Abel; and some of his children and grandchildren were really bad boys and girls. Satan, who was formerly Lucifer, had persuaded many of the good and holy angels to join him in trying to rule the world. Together with the evil ones among the human beings, they caused a great deal of 'wickedness in the world. Finally, the wickedness of man became so great that God decided it would he best to destroy them all, that is, all the wicked ones-—all who did not believe in Him ar obey Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course you would think that many of the people living al that time would know about our heavenly Father and be anxious to serve and please Him. But this was not the case. Long years of living on the earth apparently did not help the people in those days to become better men and women. Methuselah was 969 years old when he died, and there were many others who Jived from 365 to 900 years of age before they died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So God decided to tell Noah (for that was the name of the only righteous man) of His indention to destroy all the wicked people. He told Noah that because of his desire to walk with Him and always to do that which wms right lie would save him and all his family from destruction. T1m Lord told Noah to build a big house</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">that would float on water, an ark. Noah explained to the people at every opportunity that the Lord was going to send a flood of waters to destroy the wicked people, and he tried to get them to stop doing wicked things. But the people only scoffed at the old deluded Uncle Noah, as they doubtless called him, and had much fun at his expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After about one hundred years of continuous work the ark was complexed; and the Lord instructed them to move in together with all the beasts and fowl, as He had previously told Noah. After the eight persons of Noah’s family were safely in the aik together with the birds and animals, the Lord closed the door and sealed it; and shortly thereafter the rain began to come down. Do you know that this was the first rain that had ever fallen upon the earth? We shall learn more about this in future lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The floods continued until ail the land was covered with water, and all the wicked people were drowned. Finally, the waters were dried up, and the door of the ark was opened, and t^n began the work of unloading the valuable cargo which was to stai^. a new world. While the animals and birds were singing their notes of happiness, Noah and his wife and their children built an altar to the Lord and offered sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just after this offering and perhaps while they were singing a song of praise to the heavenly Father, something happened that had never before been seen. A rainbow shone out brightly on the clouds. Those good people might have wondered what it meant had not the Lord told them, 'This is my pledge to you that the earth shall never again bo destroyed by a flood of waters.’ So now you understand the reason God sent the rainbow; and I trust that every time you see a rainbow you will 'remember that it is a sign of God's promise never again to smite every living creature or destroy the earth with a flood of waters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">83. Now, these foolish teachers told people that men </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font6"> a soul. They said that this soul was something that was inside of a man, just under his skin; and that ’when a. man died his soul flew out of him into the air. They said that this soul thing, whatever it was, could never die, but was a spirit, like God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">84. Now do not these lies of the men sound just like the lie which the 'Devil told to mother Eve? See if you can remember what he said to her in the garden.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">85. God Himself says: “The soul that sinneth, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6"> shall die.” Now, as we are all the children of Adam and Eve, of course we all are sinners, like our first parents. That means that every </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">soul,</span><span class="font6"> or person, who is born, must die. Now. is that not all very plain and clear to you? Why, certainly! Then see how silly those men were who told people that they had souls which </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">could </span><span class="font6">not die, when God Himself told them that they </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wmst</span><span class="font6"> die. Whom would you want to trust and believe, these silly men or the great Lord God?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Wicked Teachers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">8fi. Our heavenly Father is the kindest and gentlest and the most loving Being </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font6"> the universe. He punishes people only for their own good; and his punishments, though severe, are not unjust. The wicked people pay for their wickedness by death. Nothing else.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">87. Do you remember about the silly teachers and the Lie they told? They are still teaching this lie today. Many thousands of people are taught this “soul” story by those who ought to know better.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">79, Is death a beautiful thing or an awful thing? Does God intend that the whole world shall stay dead for ever? Give a proof text.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">80. Instead of eompelhug everybody to stay dead for ever, what will God give to those who wish it ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">81, How would, it make you feel if anybody should lie about your father or mother? Is it right to lie about God? What good could it do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">83. What foolish lie is often told about the soul of man? 'What is a soul ? Kam? some of the creatures that are souls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">83. Tell us some more of the foolish lies that men have told about the soul of man. How do they know that man has any never-dying pari to him?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">84. Of what do these statements that there is something about man that will not surely die remind us? Who said that the first time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">85. What scripture tells us that the soul that sins dies? How many of mankind are sinners? How many of them die? Should we behme God?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">86. Does God love to punish people? For what reason only does He pumsli them ? In what way are the wicked punished? Is that entirely right?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">87. Is the lie that when people die they do not die still being told? Should those who tell the lie know better? Would you toll it?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>818</sup> Oh, what sweet and consoling music the restoration string of God's Harp brings to the heart of the Christian now! What great joy will fill that heart when, as a member of the glorified body of Christ, the blessed privilege will be had of awakening out of death that beloved one and marking his gradual restoration to perfect manhood! Then both the blesser and the blessed will praise God for his boundless love. Until that happy day, blessed is the one who claims the promise: &quot;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose [meditation] is stayed on thee, because he trustetli in thee.”-—Isaiah 26: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>619</sup> Foi’ centuries Christians lost sight of the beautiful doctrine of the restoration pictured by the tenth string of the Harp of God. This was due to the fact, that the consecrated were in captivity to the religious systems formed by man and into which Satan injected false doctrines, thereby blinding the understanding of even the honest-hearted. But with the second presence of the Lord His people have been released from such Babylonian captivity. The eyes of their understanding opening because of the brightness of His presence, they have learned of the restoration string of the Harp of God; and its sweet melody has cheered their hearts so much that they could not keep back the singing. God foreknew this, of course; and for the further encouragement of such caused His prophet to write these appropriate words relative to the restoration blessings coining to the nations and peoples and kindreds of earth: &quot;When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, v.e were like them that dream. Then was our mouth Tilled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The 1 ord hath done great things for them.”—Psalm 126: 1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>820</sup> Truly, as God’s prophet said: &quot;I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.” (Psalm 49:4) All of God’s plan has been slated in parabolic language, and is appreciated only by the consecrated follower of Jesus; but when understood, it is indeed a harp that yields the most entrancing music that ever fell upon human ears. Strike now the chord of restitution and hear how beautifully it responds and harmonizes with all the other strings upon the Divine Harp! Know, then, that as the people come to learn of God’s wonderful arrangement, all whose hearts are right will praise Him. The Psalmist thus appropriately says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;0 worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: Fear before him, all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He shall judge the people righteously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the Lord;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Foi he eometb, for he cometh to judge the eaith: He shall judge the world with righteousness, And the people with his truth.”—Psalm 96: 9-13.</span></p>
