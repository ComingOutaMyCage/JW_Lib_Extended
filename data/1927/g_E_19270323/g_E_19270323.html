<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T IS well known that Germany is meeting her reparation payments, and also that America is lending Germany the money with which to pay them.

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE earth, experiences 16,000,000 thunderstorms a year, or about 44,000 daily, so that there are about 1,800 in progress at all times. Java gets the most thunder-storms of any place on earth. The Arctic regions rarely have any. In the United States, Florida and the Mississippi Valley have the most thunder-storms, averaging thirty-five to forty a year. In California and Arizona they have but one or two in a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every thunder-storm and rain-storm starts with dust in the air. If there were no dust there would be no storm. On some tiny particle of dust there is a precipitation of moisture. Millions of these droplets often unite to form one of our common rain-drops, but every rain-drop has at least one dust particle as its nucleus. These dust specks may be microscopic in size, and usually are, although rain-water sometimes actually appears muddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is always an immense quantity of water overhead. When the sky is blue the water is invisible, but the moisture-laden atmosphere is there just the same. If all the water that is suspended over our heads at this minute were to fall to the earth at one time not a living creature on the surface of the earth would survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One inch of rainfall brings down 113 tons of water on an acre of ground. At the time of the Dayton flood twelve inches of rain fell in one night. In some places in India the annual rainfall is over four hundred inches. London has twenty-five inches of rain a year, Minneapolis has twenty-nine. Rain is caused by a warm body of air getting cooled and unable to carry its load. Then it condenses around the ever-present dust particles which permeate our atmosphere and forms drops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thunder-storms occur when a layer of hot air next the sky suddenly bursts through a of 'rid sir riwe h and starts tc n&amp;e far a mm the erixL. The top gets suddenly &quot;old.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The power of a lightning flash may bt judged from the fact that it requires 1,500 volts pressure to produce a spark an inch long, Lightning flashes of lightning have been know to leap from cloud to cloud a distance of twenty miles.

<p><span class="font5">Sheet lightning, so-called, is merely the reflection of lightning flashes which are otherwise concealed. The usual form of lightning is what is called chain lightning, sometimes known as bolt lightning. The zigzagging is caused by sudden condensation of the air in the path of the bolt. A third form of lightning consists of fiery balls or globes, possibly of air or moisture, lighted by electricity. These sometimes attach themselves to mastheads or roll along the surface of the earth and explode without effect. The thunder-clap is caused by the tom surfaces of the atmosphere rushing together after the lightning has severed them. The roll of thunder is the echo from cloud to cloud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some reason unknown the oak is fiftyseven times as liable to be struck by lightning as the beech. Trees struck by lightning are almost always isolated in the middle of fields, or are on the edges of woods. In a great thunderstorm the middle of a forest is a safe place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lightning rods have been generally discredited. Insurance companies, with, unusual opportunities to make studies of this kind, assert that most lightning rods really invite lightning. The statement is made that an ideal protection would be a heavy wire netting, or broad strips of metal, as lightning never passes through a metal covering or leaves a conductor for s build irg if the conductor has surface enough to carry the cm rent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">F WE understand the matter correctly, </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font5">thunder-storm travels along over the earth much as a lawn-mower does. The wind always blows ahead of it and straight sway from it. In the case of a tornado the storm moves ahead like a spinning top; its path is narrow', and it may and often does jump or bound or skip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A cyclone may be a hundred or more miles in diameter; its general direction is spiral; as it passes over a district the winds shift so that they seem to come from every point of the compass. The center of it is a place of calm, -without wind or storm. The damage is done when the outer rim of the great wheel sweeps through, both ahead of and behind the center itself. Cyclones in the Atlantic are called hurricanes; in the Pacific they are called typhoons. The so-called western cyclone is properly not a cyclone but a tornado.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tornadoes usually travel from the southwest to the northeast. Their path is never wide, but the funnel when formed never travels less than forty miles an hour, and often sixty; so it is hopeless to try to outrun it. When caught in the path of one, the safest thing to do is to get into the southwest corner of the cellar of a frame building, crouching close to the wall. Or one may run to the northwest and sidestep the worst of the storm. If caiighl directly in the path and there is no escape, throw yourself flat on the ground, preferably in a ditch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why tornadoes move from the southwest to the northeast is because that is the line of conflict between the southward moving cold winds of the Rocky Mountain region and the? northward moving hot winds of the Gulf Region. The tornado line is the line of greatest friction between the two air currents. The state of Arkansas is the greatest tornado state. March, April and May are the banner tornado months.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">ORNADOES have been known to drive </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font5">fence-board through the heart of a tree a foot in diameter, and to drive straws through fence-boards. They have been known to bite great chunks out of a building and no one could ever find a trace of the missing material. It is no wonder the ancients used to think a severe windstorm was some kind of great monster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A large oak tree was twisted from its roots as if it had been a weed. A half-filled glass jars of fruit were &quot;carried three hundred feet and laid down without the least damage. A earload of budding stone was tossed around like a toy balloon. A boy was blown out of a house and a few seconds later was blown back into it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A letter was picked up from a mail box and delivered by air a hundred miles away, but not at the correct destination. A garage was blown to smithereens, but the automobile within^it was undamaged. Houses were folded up like cardboard boxes; others were picked up in the air and their contents shaken out like salt out of a shaker. Birds were thrown to the earth with such violence that it killed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Things happen so fast in a tornado that sufferers lose all sense of time. In the town of Wilmette, Illinois, a tornado which some citizens claimed lasted one hour was proven to lasted but one minute. A rescue worker. noticing a baby’s shoe protruding from the debris of a miner’s home, after a tornado had passed through the village, grasped it and. found under the wreckage a little girl, who was uninjured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Buildings in the paths of tornadoes frequently explode. The reason for this is that the ordinary pressure of air is almost a ton to the square foot; but when this pressure of sir is suddenly removed by the suction effect of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font5"> tornado moving along the outside of the building, the pressure from the inside blows the building apart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Not all big wind-storms are tornadoes. Sheer wind alone takes a heavy toll of life and property.

In August, 1926, a heavy wind-storm in the vicinity of New York demolished thirty-five houses at Glen Cove and Sea Cliff.

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Oppressing the Poor in Mississippi </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Boy Goodrich</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font5">PPRESSION and graft seem to be the rule in the &quot;Delta” section of Mississippi. The term 'Delta” is applied to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">that broad,</span><span class="font5"> level floodplain toward the mouth of the Mississippi River, which is protected from overflow by the levee, made and maintained by the government. The population of this section is perhaps 95% colored, and there is said to be but one white preacher, and no bank, in the whole of Isaquena County.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The land is exceedingly fertile, and is owned in vast &quot;plantations”. The owner usually lives in Vicksburg, or Greenville, or New York. The white man who lives in the large and sometimes imposing-locking residence on the plantation fa known as the &quot;agent”, ^cmelimes he poses as being religious, sometimes he is just a plain, cursing sinner. Sometimes, however, the own®? </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font5">elf lives in a fine mansion on the plantation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. system of peonage is well-nigh in full swing. Nominally the white and colored, workers are full-fledged citizens, possessing freedom. This, however, is a sham. The agent contracts with his “bands” to give them, a certain share of the crop—usually three-fourths of the cotton produced. He also promises all kinds of things in the way of cash or credit at a commissary, for the feeding and clothing of the worker and his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the man and his family are located on the plantation and the work of producing the crop is began, the promises usually begin to f</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ail.</span><span class="font5"> Many tell us that they do not get anything but the bare necessities in the way of tools, and practically no cloth or eluthing ax alt They may buy flour and meal on credit or if they get money they get hard} enough fo Uiew bare nece.&quot;ritles, at the high e^mmwary prices charged. These it*n’s are charged against the man's share of the crop, a* d pLciiy intercft added.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the crop is gathered, the tenant has absolutely nothing to say respecting the marketing or handling of the same. He turas it over to the agent, and lives on in miserable expectancy and hope. I am told that hundreds of these farmers have as yet received no settlement on last year’s crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One very reliable and courteous Negro, known as Sam, eagerly ordered a set of Bible study books from us, to be delivered on Sunday morning; relying on the agent’s promise to every tenant farmer on the plantation to give him on Saturday the monthly “limit”—as the ©ash, grocery allowance is called. But the promise was disregarded, no money was issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we eame to Sam’s shack he was sitting on the little chopping block in front of his cabin, gloomily. Waally &amp;&nbsp;colored person who has given an order, and who has no money, when you come to deliver will make you hunt him up; but not sn with Sam, and several others on this Sunday morning. They were not sullen or resentful, but sad and disappointed, and really sorry that they could not get their books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sam came up, hat in hand, to greet us and to explain. We showed ourselves to b® the friends of the oppressed, so as to get Sam to talk. A colored man in this section does not dare to say anything which might reflect upon a white man, unless he is convinced that he is really talking to some one who is lus friend, and who will not make him trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sam then roM us that according to his wifefa figures (she was educated and could write and figure quite well) he was in debt to the plantation only $33—end these figures ware verified by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> white &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■-f his—bur the agent insisted</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">that his indebtedness xre&amp; over $(?C3, and thore-<sup>S</sup>crs had refused </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">extend</span><span class="font5"> bun ano Cunhoc cash 'kuf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Sam showed us his old ax, told us how long he had worked there alone ano ttid w had oecr purehaseo long before </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">re</span><span class="font5"> he even c*’ me to that plartetior—’wul they locked it. He showed us his trousers and shirt which his brother had given to him because .be could not get the money to buy flies® necessities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sam’s cotton was not yet all picked, and in addition to his being cheated out of the cash due him on Saturday, he had also gotten a number of other Negroes to help him pick the cotton, and the wages of these were to have been paid in cash by the agent; but the agent had turned all these claims down also. When Sam had asked him how he could get the cotton picked if the pickers were not to be paid, he was told to go and plow his cotton under.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This had seemed almost beyond the limit of endurance to Sam, and he therefore had organized on the plantation on Saturday </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> letter shower for the owner, every one agreeing to write on that Sundaji morning to the owner, appealing for help. But I fear that poor Sam’s feebte efforts to relieve the oppressions on his plantation will prove unavailing. The rale in the Delta is for the managemem to take everything. charging the tenant for his supph.es enough to take up all his share or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Il is not only the colored people who are t rented ’ n this way; we fmd that v hi te tenants are dealt v,ith in the same manner. Thus by yeara ri Laid experience the tenants have there ambl-t on crashed, and then the; assume ax’ attitude of g»ttmg ail they can in the way of allowance foi L.vmg expenses, and doing just as little work as they ©an io ger by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I could write a book of pitiful stories such as that of Sam’s to which I have just listened. A white woman on one plantation, who was far more intelligent than the common run of plantation white folks, very greatly desired a set of Scriftubjc Studies, but could not risk borrowing another dobar at the store to get them as she was scraping and saving simply to get through the season without getting further into debt, lest she should have everything swiped by the management, who would pretend that the debt consumed all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I remonstrated, “But you have a white skin. I should think you could talk up to these oppressors, when settlement time comes aiound.” “Ah, yes,” came the 'cply, “but all the lawyers and bankers in the co.intiy are leagued together with the owners, and it is imposnble for a tenant to do anything in the way of getting justice; ve are entirely at them mercy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another white man, with his wife sick in bed, had moved to tots plai taciou under certain good promises of money advances, with -which to get along. But after he came, this money allowance was suddenly cut 50%, ana he was in dire need. He wanted oar books and also a family Bible, he, had now ocen vithout &amp;&nbsp;Bible for three years: but hs had only 20 rente to his name. The Delta country needs the Lord’s kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">all'praise due for the invention of the radio. Ha knew many centuries ago- when He made the ether that in His own due time it would waft the glad tidings to cheer the hearts of the sad and comfort those that mourn, In the pages of His sacred Word are found these comforting words: “This is life eternal, to know thee, the oniy true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast seat.&quot;—-John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your great desire is that you might have the gift of life and happiness, and in the Word of God is found the way thereto. Come, then,- and let us together study His Word. That way will not be illuminated by man's wisdom but by the excellency of the power of God is it made known. It is the privilege of the Christian to carry the. message of Jehovah to his fellow man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since a knowledge of God and of His beloved Son means life, then it follows that there is n® eternal life except through Jehovah. No on®-Could follow God's way unless he has J; owtecteo thereof. The fact that the Lord has provided for. the human race at .this time to receive a knowledge- of His plan is proof that it is du® time that man should receive it. Millions of the human race are in great sorrow and distress,' It is the pleasure of Jehovah to relieve thos@ who will turn their minds to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We take pleasure in giving aid and comfort to the dumb creation. It delights us to give gift® io dur children.' How .-myouh -more is our God pleased to give unto all those who are willingly obedient to Him I The apostle expresses it thusly “Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in aU</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">©nr tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.” —2 Corinthians 1:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nor would it he of any value to the creature of Jehovah to have a knowledge of His way unless the creature is obedient thereto. God has so formed His creatures that they are free agents. He has set before them good and evil. Tie has made it clear that he who follows an evil course shall reap the rewards of disappointment and death; but he who follows the course of righteousness and obedience to God finds the way to everlasting life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Logos</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE beginning of the creation of God was</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the Logos. One of the names given to Him was the Moimng Star. lie vas a bearer of light and messenger of truth and glory, and a praise to the gre it Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5">TTP TO this point nothing had occurred to mar the beauty and glory of Gotfs creation nor to hinder the joy that pervaded it. The perfect man was placed in his perfect home, with Lyouifer as the overlord. But Lyouifer became ambitions to have a kingdom of his own. Disobedience found a place in his heart. There followed a terrible evil act, and the joy of heaven and earth was turned into woe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lyouifer indyoued man to turn away and become disobedient to God. This is known as the tragedy of Eden. That tragedy has never known a parallel. All other crimes and ti agedies may be traced to that one in Eden. Its enormity has no equal by reason of the greatness of the perpetrator, and by reason of the confidential relationship which Lyouifer held to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That terrible crime blighted the hopes of men and angels, filled the earth with woe, and caused the very heavens to weep. It started the wheels of evil and has caused them to roll on down through the corridors of the ages, spreading war, murder, disease, pestilence and famine, and crushing out the life blood of countless milhon?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So powerful and deceptive and cunning has been that arch criminal that the sensibilities c-f mankind have been stunned and benumbed, and the people for centuries have been kept in ignorance of the cause and its far-reaching effect. That act of disobedmnee, and the subsequent acts to which k 1 as led, will ultimately end In the destryoution of its perpetrator.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BOM Abel to Abraham there were few men who had respect for Jehovah. The Devil had turned the minds of almost all of them away. Amongst those who were obedient, however, was Abraham. To him Jehovah made this prom-iee: “In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” This promise was made 4,000 years ago, but that does not militate against its yet being carried into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the promises of Jehovah are certain. His iWord shall not return unto Him void, but will accomplish His purposes. He has promised it and He will bring it to pass. Man had sinned and brought death upon himself, and by inheritance death came upon ah men. It is certain then that without the intervention, of Jehovah there could never be any way whereby man could enjoy endless life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The promise was made to Abraham, but Abraham did not 'understand how it would be ful filled. He had faith in God and it pleased Jehovah, and Jehovah used him for His purposes. When Abraham had only one son, Isaacs God put him to a great test of faith. The purpose was not only to test the faith of Abraham but to make a moving picture illustrating God's manner of putting into operation His promised blessings. The picture was made like £his:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Abraham journeyed to Mount Moriah together with his son Isaac. At the direction of the Lord </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font5"> there built sn altar, placed wood upon it, bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, and then drew his knife to kill him and offer him up as s sacrifice. Then the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham and directed him that the picture had gone sufficiently far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What did that picture show? Abraham represented Jehovah God. Isaac represented God's beloved Sou; and the picture shows that at some time God would pot to death His beloved Son, whose death, would open the way for man to return to Him and get life everlasting ir- a state of happiness. Abraham died, not knowing how &lt;his would be carried into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two thoii&amp;sud jem's more passed eway, dur mg which period of time God frcquerLy re ferred to fhm promise icade to Abraham, and enacted other pictures showing how it would be ©awito into operation Then it was that He arranged to send, and ’did send, EEs beloved Son, the Logos, from heaven. His life was transferred to the human plane. He was bora a man-ehild. He grew to manhood’s estate. H® was now a human Son of God because begotten by the power of Jehovah. He was the Logos made flesh, dwelling amongst men. God was now preparing to prodyoue “the seed” which Ha had promised Abraham, and through which “seed” life should come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God named His beloved Son Jesus, because that name means Savior. When He reached th.® age of thirty years He began His ministry. Be it noted that the first thing that He did was to present. Himself to John the Immerser at the Hiver Jordan and ask to be baptized in the water, thus symbolizing that He had agreed to be obedient to His Father’s will. He said: “Lo, I eonie; in th.® volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart”—Psalm 40 •. 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within a short time thereafter, Satan the Devil put in operation his scheme to causa Je-bus to be disobedient. He laid before Jee-us three great temptations, and had He yielded to any one of them He would have lost everything. He spurned these temptations. Tie knew that He would be subjected to great humility and suffering amongst men, yet He went on joyfully doing His Father’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus not only was misunderstood but was persecuted by those who claimed to be the servants of God. He was accused o£ every crims known to the criminal calendar, yet He was holy harmless and without sin. His obedience to Jehovah God, even to the most ignominious death, won for Him the highest prize within the gift of the great Eternal One. Concerning this it is written in Philippiaos 2:7-11:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of wen' and being found in fashion as a man, he bumbled himseii, and became obedient onto &lt;lea‘h, even the death of the cross. Wherefore CoG also hath highly exalted him, and jrven him a rase which is above every uome: that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">n*</span><span class="font5"> the mrae of Jesus every knM should bo .v, of thing* m heaven, and things in earth; and things under the earth; and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that </span><span class="font5">every tongue should confess that Jesus Ctafsfc is Lord, to the glory of God the FatiswA</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">npHE obedience of 'Jesus led to the greatest ”*&gt; exaltation for Himself. In addition thereto it gained for man an opportunity tor life. Herein lies the secret of His statement that to taw God and Christ Jews leads to life. &quot;Why then had this perfect O^e come to earth; suffered and died. The answer enables ns to know more of God’s love and of the loving obedien.ee ©f Jesus, and of the way that leads to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A perfect man had sinned and lost the right to life, and God’s taw provided that the only way whereby that right eould be regained is by the voluntary death of another perfect mam Tim earth did not prodyoue a perfect man, for the reason that all were the offspring of Adam j henec all were born in sin and shapes in iniquity., as it is recorded in Psalm 51; 5; “Behold. I was shapen in iniquity; and la sin did my mother eoneeive me.” NVherefore, as by one mao. sin entered into the world, and death by ria; and so death, passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”—Bomans 5: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For this reason there was none that eould re</span><span class="font8">deem </span><span class="font5">man or give to God a ransom for him, (Psalm 49:7) The desperate ©ondition of the tarnaa race is here seen. There was a-desire for life, yet no way to life was known, and all were hurrying on down the great broad way of de-gtrnetion. But the love of God made provision, SS it is written: <sup>&lt;f</sup>For God so loved th© world, that he gave his only begotten Sou, that whoso</span><span class="font8">ever </span><span class="font5">believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life/— John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The perfect man Jesus had come into the world and died that He might provide a price whereby Adam and his offspring cxrnld be re-teased from death and have the opportunity to live. lie stated it thus, in Matthew 20: 28: “Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered into, tat to minister, and to give his life a ran-sum for many.” And agnin He said: “1 am com® that they might have Life, and that they might tew it .more atandanHy.”—John 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, Jesus said, in John 6:50 and Bl: “This is the bread which someth ctow from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, ata not di®. I the living tetatevhieh came down from teawa: if any man eat of this bread, he shall </span><span class="font8">five </span><span class="font5">for ever: and the bread that I will give is my Iteto, which I will give for the life of the </span><span class="font8">woridta</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s Uns^eeteWe GW</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">GtavTS which human beings bestow upon each other are. necessarily small. They are ex-pressions of love for ©ne another, but eompara* lively of little intrinsi® value. But the Gift which the great Jehovah. God gave to man was and is beyond comparison with any that man might confer. Its value to as cannot b® measured. The apostle speaks of it as God’s Unspeakable gift” That which He loved dearer than all things, Hfe only beloved Son, He gave to suffer and die, that man might have the opportunity to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But that Gift to ns or for us could be of no value unless we knew about it. In order for « gift to be effective there must be a giver and a zeeeiver; the giver must be willing to part with, what he has and the receiver willing to take it. There nrast be a meeting of the minds. God gave His beloved Son that man might live, tat man must know about this fact ata accept the Gift upon the terms offered. Thus the apostle states it, in Eomans 5:18: “Therefore as by the offence of one judgment earn© upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of ©ne the free gift came -apon all men unto justification of life.®</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All men were condemned by virtue of the wrongful act of one, Adam; tat all men shall have an opportunity for fife, ata hence an opportunity to receive the free gift of life, by reason of the obedience of One, Christ Jesus. “For as by on® man’s disobedim®® many were mad® sinners, to by the ©bedien.ee of one shall many be naade righteous.® (Bomans 5:19) It follows then that only those obedient to the will of God shall have the blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Tri SteF</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T IS through rthe seed” of Abraham according to the promise that the blessings shall com®. It follows that “th© ®«T mast be the first ones receiving the blessing, and then be used as a channel of blessing for others. “Th© seed” of Abfotexn, as defined 'by the Scriptures, consists. of The Christ—Jesus the Head and the members of Hte body, the etareh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Ptaterost the Lord God began to gefeet from amongst, men those who shall constitute the body of Christ For ninetetm hundred years this process of selection and election has prth greased, and amongst thoge who have heard the good message of salvation there have dowlopta ftree dasaes: (1) Those who go into destmction and 'who- are designated the disobedient; (2) those who are fully obedient and receive the full hlessiW of life and eternal happiness in heaven j snd (3) those who are only partially olw Kent but who are fore-ed through a condition that compels their obedience in order that they might live*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to enter any one of these clashes knowledge is first essential. To all syouh Jesus gays: “1 am the way, the truth and the life: w msn eomdb unto the Father but by me/’ (John 14:6) Throughout the Gospel Ago, which is now ending, the glad tidings have been preached; and by reason thereof some have come to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have come to a knowledge of the truth and have taken advantage of it have made a consecration to da the will of God. Bceause of their faith in the shed blood of Jesus they are justified, and their justification eonstitnteg a ©all to the heavenly calling. These are begotten to the divine nature and anointed 'with the holy spirit. This puts them in fine for membership in the body of Christ. Then, their testing begins, ami then obedience is required; and the obedient ones receive the highest blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The will of God is His law expressed in His Word. Il to the will of God that all who receive life shall be obedient to His law. Jesus stated the rate thus: “Cad no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in teaven. Fritter be ye called masters: for is your Muster, even Christ. . . . And whoso-. ever shall exalt himself, shall be abased; and he that aha 11 humble himself, shall be exalted.”—” Matthew 23; 9,10,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">through mJ the Gospel Age there has been a dass of men who have exalted themselves, who have desired to be honored amongst men, wh© have desired others to call them Father, or other special titles, and pay tribute to them. Ties® have received their reward ©n earth. These are not obedient ones, because they have .Bought to exalt themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore it is stated in the Scriptures what eourse the Christian, must follow: “Be elothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace unto humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.® —-1 Peter 5:5,6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Humility means to be fully robm&amp;dve t® God’s will and to follow in the footstep® wlwrt Jesus trod. Those who seek to exalt themselves follow in the way that Lueifer took, and there end shall likewise be death. Those who humble: themselves under the mighty hand of God, le&amp;ra to tow Him and learn the way that Jesus trod,, find the reward of eternal life. It is only to syouh that the promise to made: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of liferi —Revelation 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There have been many who have consecrated themselves to the Lord, bat there win not be many who reach the heavenly kingdom. To these Jesus said: “Fear not, little flock; it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” These ax*o they who delight to do God’s holy will, and who delight to keep His commandmeats. To them Jesus said: If you love me, you will keep my commandments, and my Father will We you/</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have now come to the time of the end of the world, when the Lord is present and when His Wisdom is coming in. Now He commands that this good news of the kingdom shall be told to the people. These are the words in which His command is couched: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who joyfully obey this command in telling others of the glad tidings of the King, and tell them, without money and without price, are the ones who love the Lord. It is those who love the Lord that shall be exalted. “Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.”—1 John 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has promised the exaltation of all the obedient ones of this class to membership in the body of Christ. With the completion of the number selected the elected ones shall be exalted with the Lord Jesus in His kingdom. The promise of Revelation reads: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” “But that which ye have already hold fast till I come. And he that overeometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations. —Revelation 3:21; 2:25,2&amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE story of Joseph is one of those, prophetic pictures in which the fine hand of the divine Artist is discernible. In the shadow back of the tragic details of the life of Joseph can be clearly traced the outlines of the life of Another, whose experiences and glory were yet to be revealed. Even 'when read as a record of history the story of Joseph is intensely thrilling; but when the picture of the future is discerned, it is the one which gradually takes form before our eyes, until it becomes the real, and the life of Joseph be-becomes the shadow. None but a divine Artist could paint with such skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One writer has well said, “Of all the patriarchal stories, the one of Joseph is the most artistic. A striking peculiarity of the story is the individuality and marked personality of the hero. His life displays the noblest traits. He passed through every phase of life unscathed and •untarnished. Me stands out as one of the most beautiful personages of all history.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Joseph was his father’s favorite son, beloved for his uprightness and nobility, which stand out in marked contrast to the traits of his brothers, who actually sold him as &amp;&nbsp;slave because of their jealousy of him. He was falsely accused and throv,n into prison and bound in chains. But his faith in God never wavered. As an interpreter of dreams he was acknowledged as being favored by divine wisdom; and Pharaoh appointed him to the second position in his kingdom, which position Joseph, held for eighty-years. The full account is found in Genesis 37-50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Early Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N OBHFJ? to trace foe outlines of the beautiful p'crnre hidden in the shadow. M us first follow bie hhmnoal &quot;crratfoo of Joseph ? LG tip l ore ekmolj About 20 years after *The first Genesis 1:1 to 7 a ■ «ti t 1 &gt;&nbsp;v a.- \&quot;i ™ ix Gfo is ..cw kn wo m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aL’ am ’o &gt;&nbsp;-v</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span></p>

Wk i 'w ernved u»®re God said to Abraham “ or JI tho land that I will show you. to there I will give , wid to your seed for ever. , . . A and I will walk through all the length of it and in and the breadth of it; I will give it unto thee.”—Genesis 13:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twenty-five years later Abraham’s son Isaac was horn. He was the heir of aJi&amp;ham. and also heir of the promise made by Jehovah to Abraham. Sixty years later Isaac had a son Jacob by name. He became the heir of Isaac and also the heir to the heavenly promise, as recorded in Genesis 26 2 and 28:13. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, each in turn, looked for the fulfilment of the promise of God, but each one lived as a pilgrim and as a stranger in the land which he expected some day to own. Over 1770 years after the death of Jacob, St Stephen, just before he was stoned to death for declaring his faith in Jesus as the Christ, said, as recorded in Acts 7:5, that- God had not given Abraham a foot of the land up to that time. It is now nearly 1900 years later still, and we can witness that neither Abraham nor Jacob is owner of that land yet; so the fulfilment of that promise is still future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jacob had twelve sons, by four different wives. Joseph was the first-born of Rachel big favorite wife, though the eleventh so far age was concerned. Joseph manifested the noble traits and faith of his father and grandfathers, lie firmly believed in the promise made to Abra ham, and this faith inspired his whole life. Not only was he handsome in form and feature, but he was beautiful in character as well. He was his father’s favorite son and in line for the heirship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Joseph’s honesty and uprightness were a constant cebuke to his older brothers, They were jealous of him and hated him. When he was seventeen years old his father sent him to his brothers, who were caring for their father’s Hoeks at some distance from where Jacob was dwelling. When the brothers saw Joseph coming their haired J-riousy increased, «nd they determined to kill him. God permitted the'o to go far enough to show foriw beto » intent «nu An &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lui jam. s* tmgn &gt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">By the suggestion of one of foe of them instead of killing him * he said they would n to a bend of Ishmoclwe-, who took hirri o into Egypt and so<sup>T</sup>d him as a Give io Potiphar, eap+nn of the king’s guard. Josen^G honesty and virtue never did not leave Mm. his integrity and fair life ”W’W rttorndzed by Potipbar, who made him - his steward of his ent’re household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of his beauty and ability Potiphar’s wife became enamored with Joseph and endeavored to have him prove unfaithful to his master. This he refused; and in her rage at having her amorous suggestions spurned, she falsely accused him to her husband of the very act he had refused to do. Potiphar naturally believed his wife, and threw Joseph into prison and had him bound in chains. But he continued to be faithful to God. The keeper of the prison soon recognised the ability and trustworthiness of Joseph, and made him a “trusty”, and virtually turned over to him the entire charge of the prison and prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Joseph’s interest in his fellow prisoners awakened their friendship for him. Later two of them, servants of Pharaoh, imprisoned for some minor offense, had dreams the same right which troubled them. These Joseph interpreted, and the interpretations came true; thus indicating that God was &amp;till with him, even though he was yet m prison under a false charge. God permitted him to remain in prison for at least two years more. This must have been a severe test +o Joseph’s faith, but it wavered not. He was learning some valuable lessons in the school of experience. God then overruled in a peculiar manner. He did not toko Joseph from prison directly, but brought him prominently before the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pharaoh had two dreams which none of his wise men could interpret. Then it was that the king’s butler, one of the two whose dream Joseph bad interpreted tvo years before, recall xl his promise to bnng Joseph’s case before Pharaoh. He then told the king of Joseph’s ebiMy to inter pi «t creams. Pharaoh immediate-ri sent for h<sup>;</sup>m. Here we &lt;,uwe from the Bib’s kw&lt;], as fohows:</span></p>

There were to be </span><span class="font8">seven </span><span class="font5">years of great plenty, to be followed by seven years of severe famine, when all the abundance of the full years would be needed to save the people alive. Joseph modestly offered some suggestions to the king as to how he could meet the situation successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jess’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">C</span><span class="font5">ONSIDER for a moment the peculiar eir-eumstanees arranged by Jehovah in </span><span class="font8">order </span><span class="font5">to bring about His purpose in regard to His servant Joseph. The king end his royal courtiers are the actors upon the stage. A matter c.f national importance is under consideration. Th® king had been honored by having two special dreams and all the wise men of the kingdom had been called in to interpret them. The king’s court sat in royal state. But none of the wise men were able to give the king the desired m» formation. Great honor would go to whoever could interpret the king’s dream. It was an opportunity of a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here comes a slave from prison who, standing before the king, interprets the dream and makes suggestions to the monarch. The bearing of the slave was humble, dignified, courteous; and his wisdom and foresight were bo manifest to all that Pharaoh said to his servants:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Can we find such a man as this in whom the spirit of God isf And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art.

<p><span class="font5">And Joseph went tfooug’iont all the land of Egypt. And duruig the seven plenteous years he laid up food in every city. And Joseph gathered corn as the sand by the sea, and left off counting, for it was wiihoiff number. At the ©nd. ot &lt;be seven plenteous years the seven years of dearth began.

AU </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the ccumri.es</span><span class="font5"> came to Egypt u&gt; Joseph to buy food, beeause the famine was grievous nt all lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was the third time Joseph had been specially promoted. As a slave lie had been made chief steward over all of Fotipharis house. As a prisoner he had been, made care-taker of all the other prisoners and practically rnler of the prison, Now he had been liberated aw muda second ruler in the entire kingdom of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Joseph Meets His Brethren</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N THE land of Palestine also, where Joseph’s father and brethren dwelt, the tamme was severe. Jacob and his sons soon felt the pinch, and they had to go to Esypt to bn bx^ad. Neither Jacob nor his sons knew that Joseph had become rater of Egypt, though he had been in that position for nearly nine years. .Neither did Joseph's brethren reeognw him when they saw h</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">im.</span><span class="font5"> as they bought their eurn. However, Joseph quickly recognised them, but did not make himself known. He first wanted to know if they had changed any during the more than, twenty years he had been separated front Him, He, therefore, spoke to them in Egyptian, through an interpreter. He then put them through several severe experiences to test them, and was glad to note that they had greatly ©hanged for the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Joseph also learned that his father, Jacob, and his younger brother, Benjamin, whom he special-. ly loved, wore bolh living. This is all graphically told in the 42nd to the 46th chapters of Gem ©sis, hut too long to quote here. &quot;We suggest that you read them carefully. You will greatly enjoy the account. Finally Joseph made himself known to his brethren, and the family reunion was one long to be remembered. Joseph ar-ranged to bring his father and all his brothers and their families to Egypt, where he could nourish them during the remaining five years of the famine. Thus the brother whom the others so haled as to want to kill him, became their savior and protector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Prophet Amos (3:7) tells us, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A. </span><span class="font5">secret is for information later. God is now opening these secrets of His Word and it is our privilege to understand the things heretofore hidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Joseph went tc Egypt the great pyramid of Giza bad been Irailt about 203 years, It stood in all its pristine beauty, with its polished marble sides glistening in the sunlight Fke a mirror.

<p><span class="font4">[Juvenile Bible story radiocast from WORD on a wave length of 275 meters by C. D. Nicholson.!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;XZ</span><span class="font5">OU will all be interested in the story I have to tell you now, I am sure; for it is about </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font5">wonderful man who was never </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font5">little boy. Ever since you came to live in this big world you have seen many little boys and girls, and have noticed how they grew bigger and bigger each year until finally they became grown-up men and women. This is the way that God arranged to have the world filled with people, and every man and woman who has ever lived, excepting two of whom I shall tell you shortly, has once been a little baby and has grown up to he a big man or woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But what would you think about a man who never was a little boy, and who did not have any father or mother to take care of him. as you have, and who never had the chance of flying kites, mnning, jumping and playing tag, baseball or any of th<sup>n</sup> other wonderful games that boys play today? The fart is that he did not haw o Twice r&lt;&gt; pbty, for tbeio ’sa« nobody fox fc<sup>;</sup>m to play with</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">D you not thfok tt strange that such a thing could be true? *’ call you back to kv-* wh.rc this man kvec. wheie he came from, and what his name was? I am sure you would. But before I tell you about lin&gt;, I must describe for you the beautiful homo where he lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">O® </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Siast Beautiful Home Anyone E&amp;er Had</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">LONG, long time ago, before any houses were built, and before homes of any kind weie male on this earth—in fact, while the earth on which we live was quite a wilderness— the great Jehovah God decided that He would choose a ioeabon on the earth best, gutted io Hfo purpose anj there make a very beautiful garden. So a place was selected where lie mnTeee of the earth Lad various forms, end where the possibilities of makirg a garden of old not be sunnaswd for vianfonr and beauiv.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tht-re wore mountains with ragged peaks and greenery, lid's with gentle elopes, and ravines with blue streams and brooks coursing down their vdey &gt;s- ~-‘li the rjasi luxuriant growth of vegetation, where the awmaU found food, and places for trail ttna names and raUnxg their jouig. The h’rds also vovlo (mu itu* a veritable paradise in which to l«ve, build ilicii nests and raise their babies. Eveiything that would lend beauty, splendor and grandeur to be placed there, because it was to become the perfect home of a strong, handsome, perfect, man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next thing that God did was to cause </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font5">great spring of clear, pure water to burst forth out of the ground and flow out through the garden. You have no idea how large that spring was, either. Most of the springs we know about send forth just enough water to make a little branch or brook. But this spring was so large that its water made a great river, which gently flowed out through the garden. After passing through the full length of it, the waters were divided .and became four separate rivers, which wended their way on down to the sea or ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then God put little seeds of every description into the ground which, in the v a”m, moist air, brought forth beautiful flowers of every color imaginable, and fruit trees of every description; also palm trees wtth great, spreading bxanel.es, evergreens, cedars, ornamental shrubs of every Lind, and many other t ■'&lt;•&lt;?«, all of which made this the mosl beautiful garden imaginable</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even in the edges of the water ol ire river there grew big white water lilies with a ring of yellow, which seemed to drink in the s n« as they, held their golden-crowned heads arise to the rippling waters. All over the garden toe soft, green grass grew to furnish food for the pet animals which this wonderland man had for his very own; for God had already created animals, and birds, and fishes, of all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the trees and rocks grew beautiful vines, with flowers of every hue and eohm to furnish food for the bees and butterflies, and fragrant perfume to fill the air. In the tops of the trees the he’jpy birds built their nests and fluttered and sang their wonderful songs of joy. AS ibe bird a nr'i anio'ak were happy and ct^ttnicd anj’dst Lose beaut iul ■sutroitod ‘n’vm the Lord en\A-cd walking’m bus garaeu, so you may be sure it </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">;,zb</span><span class="font5"> a wonderful place</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">f &gt;&nbsp;SjuL tee world there was not a living being in the beautiful garden in the east. Then, for the isands o» yen? d Lev ah, our God, had been steadily preparing tb? earth as a suitable home for the bw» fawh. The preparation o£ this beauti£u&gt; garden ia Eden was but the finishing of this work; and when it was completed God was then ready to make or create the first human being.</span></p>
<div>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Long before this He had determined just how He should make man, and in speaking to His helper He said, <sup>t5</sup>Let. us make man in our image, after our likeness/’ He also determined that man should be the very highest of earthly creatures: that he should be the ruler over the fishes of the sea. over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle and all the beasts, and over every other kind of animal and insect on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When everything was in readiness—with a home which covered peiliaps several hundred acres of land., and with everything needed for food and clothing, God made this wonderful man and placed him in this garden which He had made. Then He told him that he could have everything in the garden for his very own, including all the birds, animals, fishes, flowers and fruit, with the single exception of the fruit of one tree in the middle of the garden, which God kept as His own personal property. The man was not even to touch that tree. But it was his duty to look alter all other things—-to care for the garden and to prime the trees and to look after the animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to have a large number of pet animals and birds given to you, what is the first thing you would do after laying in a supply of food for them, and preparing a place in which to keep them ? I suppose you would do the very same thing that this wonderful man did—give to each and every one of them a name; for that is what Adam did. And whatever he called an animal or bird, that was to bo its name always.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">V'onld it not be fun to try to spell and pronounce the names which Adam gave to the animals new birds? Suppose you try to go it sometime. T will if you see m ming them yon v might give him of their shorter nan s than Adam did. I think I shorn- if J were doing it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Xow yost know that mm man’s name was Adam. He w the first <sup>rv</sup> -m who ever Jivcd oa the earth, and m wos he was a little \ 7; for he was a fall-grown man. when God er </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">^tc</span><span class="font5"> « b'n. If •would be wHO'dl* I'* If c the Awr, becanse opne oi us has ever omsm ‘■dw. and’ as he vsa. be must look like &quot;'heat the handsomest man anvbody has. ner seen. With ore single exception he vas the only perfect man wro ever lived on the earth. T)o you know who the other perfect Man was? It vas Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I wish I had time to tell you all about Adam, but I have not time to do so now. You must know, however, that besides being handsome and beautiful, Adam could see perfectly. He had perfect eyesight; he could hear perfectly; he could talk perfectly; he could think perfectly; he could understand perfectly; he could do everything exactly right, becanse he was a pcr-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fect m-cm.</span><span class="font5"> He knew exactly the proper amount and the kind of food to eat. As long as he lived in the garden of Eden he lived on fruits, nuts, vegetables and herbs, and ate no meat</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adam enjoyed the work which God had given him to do, and was very thankful for the beautiful home which had been prepared for him. But Adam did not have anyone to talk to but his pets, except when the Lord visited him. He got on nicely this way for quite awhile, perhaps for a year or more: and then he began to grow lonely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font5"> Most </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Wonderful Woman that Ever Lived</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font5">UR heavenly Father noticed that Adam was growing lonely, and decided that He must make another person to keep him company and to be his helper. He wanted Adam to have an assistant who was really a human being just like himself. In fact, He wanted him to know that his helper was closely akin to him. So one day He put Adam to sleep, and opened up his side and removed one of his ribs. Out of that rib God made the most beautiful woman that any one has even seen; and Adam, knew that the woman was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, and that God bad given her to him for a helpmate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adam was delighted—more so, perhaps, than you are when God sends a little baby to be your little brother or sister—becanse he had never had any other human being to talk to and keep him company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ve’*y first th'ng Jam did was to gi, e this kvrfy lady e name, jW pg ycu do the baby foot comes tn your hcn«c. Du you know what Atom aam-'d nert Ifo ' &lt;* In • the mme Eve, rw-'ers^ r to be the name? Of the same family fam<sup>n</sup>y, :v&lt;-’ tm Iri was to be foy u-dhm.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">55. God made man from the dust of the earth. That sounds queer, does it not? But it is true. If we go irn-o the yaid and make a little man out of mud, we shall have about the same material in the mud that is found in the bodies . bf real men. But the mud man cannot move or speak or think. The mud man lacks life. That is the great difference.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">56. We are all made of the dust of the earth, but it is the LIFE within us that makes us talk, think, move, and makes us pleasant to look upon. Dead people are not pleasant to look upon, bemuse their life has gone, and they are turning back to dust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">57. Therefore, when w see what life can do with a pile of dust or elay, how it makes us love the great Jehovah, the Giver of life I Lif® ig His gift, and only He and none other can give it. Now He has promised everlasting life to those who seek it, and 1 am sure we all want to live always and always, do we not!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">58. Father Adam, when God had made him from the dust of the earth and then had given him the wonderful gift of life, began to live and enjoy the beautiful tilings around him. he had been placed by God in a beautiful garden, much prettier than the prettiest garden you have ever Seen; and this was called Eden.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">59. Everything that gives pleasure was there In Eden—wonderful flowers, delicious fruits, dear, cool springs, and a soft, warm climate.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">with no snow or blizzards. In fact it was so warm and nice in the garden of Eden that Adam did not need any clothes; and as there were no thorns to scratch him, or wild beasts to eat Mm up, be got along very nicely.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">60. The animals (and there was every kind of animal you can name) were all tame, and would come al Adams call. He was a perfect man, and was made to be the master of all the other creatures of earth. He was not cruel to the animals, but lov ed them and was kind to them; and they loved him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">61. God tells us in His own words about our parents. “God created man in Ins own, image: in the image of God created h? him.&quot; That is. the perfect man had reason, memory, Will, judgment, benevolence, Me., like Jehovah; but of course he did not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">look</span><span class="font5"> like God, becanse God is a spirit being. God said to man, “Be fiujfful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.** --Genesis 1: 27,28.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">Why would Ite awaken the dead out of their graves unless He intended to give them an opportunity to be restored to the perfection enjoyed by Adam before he sinned?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>£</sup>“ God has invited ug to use our reasoning faculties (Isaiah 1:18); and if we believe these great truths taught in the Bible, we ?an reach no other reasonable conclusion than that restitution is the great objective of God’s plan relative to the human race, and that restitution blessings are near becanse +he kingdom of heaven is at hand, even at the door. Let those who are east down, look up now; let the sorrovrful be glad; let the sad hearts be comforted, and th© broken hearts be hound up. Lift up your heads and rejoice in the fact that the day of deliverance for mankind is at the door 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>693</sup> Call to mind for a moment the great a~ mount of suffering in the densely populated cities.
