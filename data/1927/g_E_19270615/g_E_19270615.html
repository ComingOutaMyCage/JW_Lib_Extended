Reforestation would do something. Tremendously expensive spillways at the mouth of the river would do something for New Orleans and vicinity. Levees along the entire length of the lowlands will do more. But when the waters of thirty-one states have added to them the flood waters caused by heavy rains on a heavy fall of snow, and all these waters must pass through one channel on their way to the sea, the Mississippi must always remain not only the Father of Waters but the Father of Sorrows for those who live along its banks from Cairo to the sea.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The American soft coal miner averages to get only 140 days of work a year, so that on a basic wage of $7.50 per day his annual-earnings are only $1,050, and that is not enough to live on. Moreover, 2,500 miners were killed outright in 1926. Yet we are told that there are 200,000 too many soft coal miners in the United States. Evidently here is a place for the government to step in. The government should make the mines safe fox* the men, regardless of cost; and it can be done. Mines that cannot be profitably worked should be closed. Those that are worked should be worked steadily. The government is or ought to be properly interested in the conservation of coal, and it is freely claimed that by present m^bods of mining fif% percent of all coal is left irrecoverably in the groend.

The erection of tall apartments with ample open spaces and with elevators must be undertaken. Private enterprise will not do it. It is the duty of the municipality to respond. Brushing aside, until we can get all the facts and act understandingly, the quest .on of costs and revenue, I respectfully insist era the cardinal principle that cost means less than the successiuI outcome. The question of land values, of cost of buddings, of taxation, of revenue, are all secondary to the question of this dire need of the poorer classes, v.liose appeal for so many years we have disregarded, wli-ne misery and misfortune accumulate as our population increases and our unparalleled wealth reaches mom i i:a high.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">R</span><span class="font7">EFERRING to the withdrawal of all missionaries from China, Arthur Brisbane says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world at large will wonder with the missionaries, What used to happen to the Chinese before the missionaries went in? la it conceivable thatthey all went to hell? Four hundred million, going below every few years would make soon a terrific population in the city of Buffering. Billions of Chinese must be there now, even scores of billions, to say nothing o£ other heathen. It is a solemn problem that may well worry the missionaries. It is safe, fortunately, to assume that Providence has some solution that does not involve burning so many ignorant people forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible answer to the solemn problem is that at death everybody goes to hell, with absolutely no exceptions. Even Christ went there. The Bible hell is the grave, where all await the resurrection. The heathen are no worse off there than are the Popes and other Doctors of Divinity. All are in the same place; and in the resurrection many of the poor heathen will fare far better than the theologians who have harassed their living and dying moments and clung desperately to them and to their relatives while there remained the shadow of a hope that they could scare a few shekels out of their clothing, and so make it temporarily easier for themselves before they land there, too. As money makers the hell and purgatory grafts have every other money making device backed off the boards. The worst of it is that they have had so much influence that the truth as to what hell really is seldom finds any place in the public press, and never finds any place in the pulpit. But gradually the truth is coming out anyway. It can be hid no longer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE history of human society from early days has been interspersed all along the line -with accounts of individuals who more or less successfully indulged a penchant for doing away with, to them, objectionable fellow mortals by the subtle and cowardly method of poisoning. In this they have betrayed a family likeness to Satan, the great and invisible enemy of man-id nd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despicable however as the conduct of the class of debased liumaiu here referred to has been, another class far greater in numbers and having apparently a &quot;much closer relationship to the father of lies have also been in existence. This class have likewise occupied themselves with the destruction or injury not only of individuals but of families, communities, and even nations; and by the same method, poisoning. The former class, however, have concerned themselves only with the destruction of the physical beings of other mortals; while the latter class, to accomplish their designs, have poisoned the minds of their victims, thereby jeopardizing human souls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The arch-poisoner of all ages has been Satan, the erstwhile princely light-bearer. Beginning with his first successful attempt in Eden, Satan has progressed in the science of poisoning, until now under his supervision a steady stream, of artfully disguised poison is very acceptably administered seven days a week to millions of human beings, ostensibly as food for the .mind and heart, but in reality concocted for the purpose of deadening the perception in some connections and inflaming the passions in others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE following statement contained in the aforementioned newspaper article is a subtle piece of hurtful propaganda:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Russia is maintaining a gigantic army, partly for the purpose of giving state jobs to an otherwise pauper population but also with an idea that some day she might go about the task of imposing her communistic will upon her neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the first place, while it is true that in 1920 the Bed Army numbered 5,300,000, the army of the Soviet Union now numbers only about 562,000. In terms of population, the Soviet Union now has 41 soldiers for every 10,000 inhabitants, while Roumania and Poland have about 100; and France, exclusive of her colonies, 200. In other words, the western European &quot;democratic” states have from three to five times more men under arms than does the Soviet Union. In relation to territory, for every 1000 square kilometers there are 27 soldiers in the Soviet Union, while there are 560 soldiers for the same area in Roumania, and 700 in Poland. So much then for the &quot;gigantic” army of Soviet Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, says the editorial, this &quot;gigantic” army is maintained &quot;partly for the purpose of giving state jobs to an otherwise pauper population”. According to the figures above given, the number of soldiers for every 10,000 inhabitanta of the Soviet Union is 41. Assuming that each one of these soldiers represents an average family of five persons, even then only 205 of every 10,000 persons are ‘preserved from poverty’ by the</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">&quot;state jobs” of these 41. This leaves 9,795 of every 10,000 to be classed not “otherwise” but as actual “pauper population*. And since these calculations are based upon an approximated population of about 130 million souls, the Soviet Union today must be burdened with the appal-. Img number of over 127.000,000 paupers. Blah!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark121"></a>JFftat </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Are the Facts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">W</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">HA</span><span class="font7">T are the facts in this connection! Actually the possessors of an estate comprising one-sixth of the earth’s surface, abound-ing in natural resources and corresponding opportunities for development and cultivation, with all the expedition that is possible commensurate with the tremendous task that has been undertaken, the Soviet peoples are being ... educated, trained and encouraged by their leaders to cooperate in the realization of the benefits that may accrue to them collectively and individually, but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not selfishly,</span><span class="font7"> from the vast resources which are theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must be remembered that up until 1917, under autocratic czarism and a profoundly corrupt religious system, the great bulk of the Russian people were kept in a state of semi-barbarism, and were probably on a considerably lower level in the matter of literacy, culture and economic intelligence, than were the Negroes of the southern states in slavery days. Wonderful changes have taken place in these respects in the Soviet Union since the revolution of November, 1917, but much yet remains to be done. The point that I desire to make here is that the immense amount of human raw material in Bussia requires time in order to be worked into suitable shape, by education and proper training, before the resources of that enormous estate itself can be made adequately available.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>N@t</span><span class="font7"> As </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unemployed</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font7">OVIET Bussia has done magnificently for her unemployed. In August, 1925, the actual number of aD. unemployed (both registered and wregistered),ao5ordingto the estimates of th.® Institute for Planned Economies, was only 1,~ or 1 in each. 110 of the population. And Axes® figures have been further and steadily yedueed since that time. True it is, this was a large number. But let it be noted that this number is comprised partly of the surplus agricultural population and partly of those previously employed in occupations which have become superfluous since the revolution, with only th© smaller part consisting of industrial workers (unskilled) and officials. Hence in other countries a large number of those whom Russia classed as unemployed would not be included at all in the statistics of unemployment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then let it be remembered that in September of the same year the official figures of unemployment for Great Britain totalled 1,418,000, out of a population of but approximately 43,000,000 people, which is 1 in every 30 of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Soviet Union, however, in contrast with the capitalist states, has not the slightest interest in the existence of an industrial reserve which forces wages down; and therefore it is resolutely attacking the problem of unemployment with the expectation that it will almost if not entirely disappear within two years. As an. instance of the practical way in which the situation is being handled, unemployed agricultural laborers are being trained to manage tractors. On® consignment alone contained 12,000 Ford tractors which were shipped to Bussia via Seattle, Wash., early last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to whether the Russian army is maintained “also with an idea that some day she might go about the task of imposing her communistic will upon her neighbors”, I will leave the readers of this article to judge from what follows.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Would Even Abolish War industries</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A CELEBRATION was held in Chicago last year, on the occasion of the purchase by the Soviet Union of the American Rambouillet sheep, to be used for breeding purposes. Boris E. Skvirsky, head of the Russian Information Bureau, Washington, D. C., was one of the guests on this occasion; and in the course of a speech which he made he stated the following concerning the Soviet Union:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tba appropriation for the army and navy was less than half of pre-war; and the Soviet Union, which has reduced its army from five millions to half a million^ would be willing to support tlw most sweeping wrrasal disarmament proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Speaking in Paris, France, in December, 1925, Georges Tehieherin, Foreign Minister of the U. S. S. R., concisely set forth the attitude of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the Soviet Union with regard to matters xnil-itary, in the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the termination of the war we were. I believe, the first nation to advocate disarmament, and we officially expressed out approval of this policy in our reply to the draft of the treaty of mutual assistance. We not only vehemently criticized that treaty for giving enormous international power to a few states, but we rejected it as delaying the practical settlement of the disarmament question. Incidentally, I have just received the report of the speech made in Moscow by M. Rykoff, chairman, of die council of eoinmistaries, m which he makes the downright offer to abolish not only the army, but also </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Russian uar industries,</span><span class="font5"> provided complete disarmament becomes general. He goes on to say that he is readj’ to give his fullest support to any attempt at even part disarmament. This readiness of ours to disarm is not a mere rhetorical gesture, it is implied in our fundamental attitude to the world. We renounce not only the policy, but even, the very idea of conquest And we need an army and navy only for defense.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE esprit de corps, the animating spirit of the Red Army, is well conveyed in the following extract from a speech delivered in London by George Bernard Shaw, in January, 1920:</span></p>

Then you find out the truth about what they are actually doing. They send you about three times a week to the theatre* and let you go about pretty freely so that you can see what is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But now, in view of Hie foregoing, some one may well inquire, “Wherein lies the secret of the wonderful fighting morale of the Red Armv?” And to this question I shall reply by asking 'J inquirer to pay an imaginary v Lit with me to the Tretyakov Art Gallery in Moscow.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>The War-Loving Imperialist</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font7">ND now I will conclude this article by reproducing the comment of a prominent British writer on the scene just described. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is the difference between the Russian Communist “militarism” and the class-made, war-glorifying, hatred-organizing, truth-distorting, murder-sanctifying brigandage of Imperialist militarism. The latter seeks to teach with calculating cunning that war is a “hohla calling” and “brings out the best in h</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">uman</span><span class="font5"> nature^ In Russia they teach, abhorrence of war, that it is crud, bloody and futile, and brings out the worst in human nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Imperialism deliberately propagates its false doctrines and elevates the ignoble trade of murder into the “noble profession” of warfare, because its whole existence is based upon mean and sordid theft, graft, spoliation and slavery. Its propagandists dare not tell the truth; they must lie and equivocate or their rule could not last a week. Communism does not lie to its people, to its soldiers. Communism teaches its soldiers how to use the weapons of Imperialist militarism, teaches them militarist tactics and discipline, in order that they may the more successfully resist their would-be enslavers and preserve their freedom intact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And because the soldier of Communism knows the truth about the causes of war he fights the better. His determination is that feo servile army of Imperialist “hired assassins” shall ever succeed in imposing their system of banditry upon him and his fellows, if fighting will prevent it; and his strength, to use Tennyson’s expression, “is as the strength of ten, because his heart is pure.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark133"></a>An Armenian View of Turkey </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By David Davidian</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE article on the Turks which appeared recently in </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> was good. Of course if one has lived in Turkey for a while, as I have, there would be added information. The Turks are products of environment, and their reiigion has not hindered them from killing Christians and such as call themselves Christians. But now that the old religion of the Turks is falling to pieces, there is great hope for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One tiling in the article amused me, and that was the impression which some Americans have that ' e Turks are almost sanctified and “cannot tell a lie”—like the George Washington cherry tree and hatchet myth. If that were really true of the Turks I would be glad—glad to know that they are better than the Armenians, to which race I belong. But my honest opinion, based upon experience and observation, is that when God confounded the language of the people at the tower of Babel, and they spread out in different nationalities, there were excellent liars among all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The darkness resting upon the Armenians is largely due to the influence of the Armenian Catholic Church, which of course gets her supply of “wine” from the chief distributor mentioned in Revelation 17. There is a long history behind the Armenian revolution; and once the revolution began, the massacres were started by the Turks. During the World War Armenians in turn massacred the Turks and devastated towns and cities; and, all being under their father the Devil, we could not expect anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another point is, the Turks have found out that the European civilized diplomats axe great liars; and for that reason they have no respect for them. Furthermore, for years “Christian” missionaries have hypocritically patted the Turks on the back to save their own necks dur-ingthe massacres. All that any Armenian had to do was to turn Turk, or solemnly pretend to do so. Thousands refused. Many were tortured in indescribable ways. When the Turks would massacre a town during the war they would tell the people to get ready and they would be sent to America, Then the Armenians would he taken out a distance, the Turks would pick out the beautiful girls for themselves, and massacre the rest right before the eyes of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I believe that Europe is responsible for these massacres. 1 certainly believe that the Turks have* bfeen overrun and mistreated by European powers. I lived in Smyrna. There the Europeans came in and established English, German and French post-offices, and generally helped themselves. Now Wilson’s “self-determination” idea is working there, and no one can blame the Turks for finally awakening to their rights aS a people. In due time they will be just as honorable as the English, and the Armenian must shake hands with the Turk. When the Armenian clergy have passed away, then the people will see the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who Believes in War? Who Wants War? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Lydia G. Wentworth</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">IIF.ilE is the woman who believes in war?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Where is the man who will say that he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">uv n ts</span><span class="font7"> war ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'Where is the woman who will declare that she approves Avar as good or righteous? Wdiere is the man who will venture outspoken approval?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably some one will say that war is a necessary evil. That thoughtless, ignorant remark has been made countless times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Are evils necessary? Is any kind of evil necessary? If so, what kind? Is Avar to be an exception as the one and only evil that must be endured?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If so, Avhat is the reason for this exception? Why are Ave forced to submit to that particular fwil? And A\hy must Ave continue to submit to an eA<sup>T</sup>il so dreaded?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“War is the blackest, least excusable, most damnable crime against mankind and God Almighty,” says the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American Leyton Magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shall Ave, the people, remain passive and submit meekly to the most far-reaching and stupendous evil in the Avorld, the blackest crime that can be instituted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">War is an established custom. It AA<sup>r</sup>as begun and practised ages ago when mankind Avas in a savage state. Is that a reason for nations .who claim civilization to practise it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">War has descended to us from savagery. Shall we, who claim civilization, continue to pattern our customs and practices by savage eustoms and practices? Can’t we improve on ignorance and savagery ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us see. We have already abolished certain established eustoms which Ave recognized as evils. One was piracy. Another was dueling. ’Another slavery. We need only to arouse people <sup>ir</sup>' +kr&gt; incalculable evil of war, to make up our minds that Ave Avant no more of it, and then it can be abolished </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">vitlioM difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;War is the greatest of all evils-—therefore all the more reason that it should be abolished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">AVar is futile. It never settled anything that could not have been settled better by reasonable means in a manner consistent with eiA’ilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">W’ar is senseless. Even the victorious side pays penalties in many Avays as great as the vanquished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T challenge any person to state any reason or cause which will serve as sufficient or adequate ground for declaration of war by one nation to another </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in these days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Causes of Avar are disputes and should be settled by arbitration or legal procedure. W hat are some of the causes of Avar as represented to the public?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">First: Circumstances or events that involve national honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">WTierein does killing by wholesale—the massacre of millions of the enemy and perhaps as many of your oavh people—the bombing of villages, toAvns and cities—retrieve or avenge or </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">maintain</span><span class="font7"> the honor of any nation? Does it not drag honor in the mire? Is honor more likely to be maintained by persons “seeing red” or by the calm and deliberative procedure of arbitration by the best minds among a nation’s people ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Second: Circumstances or conditions involving vital interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wherein are vital interests furthered or maintained by collective homicide, the sacrifice of millions of persons innocent of wrong doing or thought toward each other? Does it not seem reasonable to assume that the vital interests of any nation would be far better sustained by peaceable procedures ensuring the preservation of property rather than by’destructive methods?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Third; The preservation of rights in a foreign country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again I ask: Wherein does the extermination of legions of lives—the greatest possible number of opponents that can be killed—maintain with justice the rights of any foreigners in a land other than their own ? If the laws or practices of any land do not suit, let foreigners keep away. We claim the right to make laws to suit ourselres. We must grant that same right to every other country. Why should any country dare to claim the right to interfere with or dictate the laws of another?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are causes of war which are not publicly announced but 'which are falsely represented as national honor, vital interests, et cetera. To misrepresent these to the people of any country by false propaganda is the most gigantic betrayal, the most colossal wrong, that can be perpetrated upon a people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That is -what was done in every country before the World War; for, as Lord Robert Cecil has said: </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;If the situation had been known to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the world no nation could have forced its people to fight.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is for the people to see to it that they are not deceived and betrayed again. It is for the people to refuse to believe war propaganda— however specious it may be—and to demand the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the war-mongers will have no chance to ply their trade. War persists solely because people have been brought up to believe in its necessity; and this atrocious, antiquated and absurd falsity keeps the world in darkness on this point, obscuring the light of truth. War is a left-over product of savagery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wl;o will try to think up a reason or cause that is sufficient in these days for entering upon an orgy of slaughter of millions of military forces, accompanied by the destruction of noncombatants in villages, towns and cities by bombs and poison gases?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wlio, wishing to maintain and preserve his country’s honor and dignity on the high plane which such qualities deserve, will state an adequate cause for warfare in these enlightened days ?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark135"></a>The Lion Farm</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">R</span><span class="font7">EADERS of The Golden Age will doubtless be interested to know that there is a lion farm—the only one in all the world—located two miles east of El Monte, which is about twenty miles east of Los Angeles, that southern California metropolis of a million and a half popuLition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'Tins lion farm is reached from the big city via the \ alley Boulevard Drive, and is easily found at its right hand by a massive crouching lion image at its entrance. The admission fee is idly cents per person; and the number of lions, ranging from a few days to seventeen years of age, totals 92—- all of the large black mane African variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The value of these beasts ranges all the way from $1200 to $50,000 each. The one called Cyclone manifests a vicious disposition, and cannot be trusted. He is father to about half ©f the herd. Another, a more gentle beast, is sire to the remainder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Th- animals are fed horse meat exclusively, and that only six days a week’. None are fed on</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>By J. A. Bohnet</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mondays. The food requirement per day is upwards of one thousand pounds; and at feeding time, 2 o’clock p. m., they are separated and fed in the cages. If permitted to be together at this feast they would fight each oilier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They are housed at night, but during the daytime they peacefully mingle all in one large, wire-netted, strong enclosure out of doors. In the large central enclosure, vJiere nine of the larger of the male animals roam at will, one of them bullied all the others until they tired of his abuse, then they ‘‘ganged” him simultaneously and nearly killed him. He is now a mass o£ battle scars as a consequence, and ever sine® has been a good lion, docile and gentle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The keeper, Mr. Gay, who is also manager and sole owner, fearlessly moves about amongst them, whip in hand. It will not do to manifest any fear amongst them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ninety percent of the lion scenes in movie shows are enacted in this arena. The use of a lion for a day is $200. That is a lion’s regular salary. One lion, a large male named Numa# earned, in 1926 alone, $50,000 as a movie star. This is the lion that chases people through windows, doors, transoms, hallways, rooms, and shrubbery, but never injures anyone. He is duly rehearsed for the part that he is expected to , perform, and seems to enjoy it. Sometimes he learns his part in two minutes, while for other scenes it takes hours to make him understand, what is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At one time a movie scene was planned to be taken in a colored church, full of worshipers, old and young. This monster trained lion which, standing upright measures nine feet from feet to head, was suddenly and unexpectedly turned loose in the church and began to bound over the pews, across the aisles, onto the rostrum, and over the terror-stricken colored parson and parishioners. There was no need for rehearsing </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">them</span><span class="font7"> for the speedy exit. They quickly grasped their part and performed well, while the cameramen proceeded to “shoot” the picture. This big brute would not injure even a child. But the startled assembly of colored folks did not know that, so the scene was one hundred percent realistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some female lions eat their young of a day or </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">£wo</span><span class="font7"> old, w’hen they are only about one pound in weight. Others eat them when two months old. One female will make a good mother while another may make a very bad one—some utterly refuse to mother the young. In such instances they can be raised by bo I tie nourishment at the lion farm, provided they are nursed by the mother during the first week. The baby lions must not be touched by human hands while with the mother. Any human scent on the body of the kitten prompts the mother to immediately kill it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Air. Gay has been in the lion-raising business cfor over twenty years, and knows the native temperament of these beasts. He knows them everyone by name—and such names as some of 'them have been given! Four of them are called, High, Low, Jack and Game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One big lion is called Slats, and is in the enclosure with Numa. These two huge maleS love each other and make much, fuss when separated^ even for an hour. Both are movie actors; in fact, they are stars in the profession. Mr. Gay has them trained to perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another enclosure are twelve half-grown lions, kind as kittens. In another enclosure are twelve females of from four to twelve years of age. The young lions of a month to three or four months of age are especially cute and playful</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The large lions generally lie down and stay there, stretched out at full length on their sides, until struck with the whip. They are exceedingly lazy. None of them will remain in a standing position after Mr. Gay goes out of the enclosure. Lions are not quarrelsome nor vicious, except when with young or when being fed. Mr. Gay rides Numa as one would ride a horse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Mondays the farm is closed to visitors. This day the lions all fast and are not to he unduly excited. On Sundays the place is thronged with visitors. “Better than a menagerie”, one hears the people say. The farm covers five acres, much of “which is set out to natural lion habitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These animals know obedience perfectly, A nervous lion is to be feared, however. One never knows what it might do. There are now 92 lions on the place. The lions are greatly in demand for circuses, zoos and parks throughout the world. They are transported in cages of special design. The lionesses bear their young twice a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only the owner or his wife ever enters the pens or is permitted to touch any lion. Mr. Gay slaps them in tenderness, as one v, ould slap or pet a thoroughbred horse. The daws or a lion are as sharp as a needle, ar-1 a vimas swipe of its paw lias power sumeient to Mil a horse. A trained lion a. ill siand up, • elm. its tail, or “shake hands” at corn .ar 1.

Nor would anyone vant to em.-r to price &lt;ri night, nor even m the da) time<sup>1</sup>, to steal &lt;&nbsp;a &lt;,!' these valuable beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At intervals the males give vent to tinir 1 ri-ings in terrifying roars, while sqnattml in ib&quot; ground; and an answering roar usually co <sup>11(</sup> , from one of the enclosures out of smht. '&lt; b &gt;■ lions are never inbred at this farm. All tlw oT-spring have the same fathers and mothers. Tri t is, only a few of the females are kept for breeding purposes, and no relatives are ever mate I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These animals are well content in their plers-ant environment, despite the assertion ofnn heard that lions cannot be productive in cau-tivity. Here is a successful lion fam, and a money maker at- that</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark139"></a>Governor Smith’s Differences with Rome</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">HPHE controversy between Governor Alfred</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">E. Smith and Charles C. Marshall made it clear, at least to our minds, that Governor Smith is a much better American than he is a Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Governor Smith believes in the freedom of the press; but Leo XIII in his encyclical of June 20, 1888, said, “We must now briefly consider liberty of speech and liberty of the press. It is hardly necessary to say that there can be no such light as this.&quot;’ In the same encyclical the same pope said, “It is quite unlawful to demand, to defend or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, of speech, of writing or vor.Jiip,” The Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church declares, “The Church has the right to practice tlm unconditional censure of books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Governor Smith believes in freedom of religion ; but Pope Pius IX, in his encyclical of 1 secern her 8 th, 1861, said, “It is an error to believe tint every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true.” Tn the same encyclical the same pope said, “The state has not the right to leave every man free to profess mid embrace whatever religion he shall deem true.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Governor Smith believes in the freedom of the state; but in his encyclical of December Sth, 1864, Pope Pius IX said, “It is an error that the chinch ought to be separated from the state, and the state from the church”; and in his encyclical of November l&gt;t, 1885, Pope Leo XflT said, “Ft would he very erroneous to draw the conclusion that in America is to be sought the most desirable status of the church, or that it would be universally lawful or expedient for state and church to bo, as in America, dissevered and divorced.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Governor Smith believes in the sovereignty of the people: but in his encyclical of November 1st, 1885, Leo XIII said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sovereignty of the people is held to reside in the multitude; which is doubtless a doctrine exceedingly well calculated to flatter and to inflame many passions, but which lacks all reasonable proof, and all power of Insuring public safety and preserving order. In politics, which are inseparably bound up with the laws of morality and religious duties, men ought always, and in th® Irai place, to serve.. as far m possible, the interests of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Catholicism. As soon as they arc seen to be in danger, all differences should cease between Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Governor Smith believes in freedom of person; but the Canon Law’ of the Roman Catholic Church asserts that “the Pope has the right to , give countries and nations which are non-Catho-lic to Catholic regents who can reduce them to slavery. The Pope can make slaves of those Christian subjects whose prince or ruling power is interdicted by the Pope.” The Canon Lew of flie Roman Catholic Church also asserts. “Ine Church is empowered to grant, or to fake away, any temporal possession.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Governor Smith believes in freedom from tyrants; but in his encyclical of March IStli, J871, Pope Plus IX said, “The Pope is the supreme judge of the law of the land”; and in his encyclical of November 1st, 1885, Leo XIII said. “As regards opinion, whatever the Roman pontiffs have heretofore taught, or shall hereafter teach, must be held with a firm gra«p of mind and, so often as occasion requires, must be openly professed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Governor Smith has respect for American laws; but the Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church declares that “the Pope Jias the right to annul state laws, treaties, constitutions, etc., to absolve from obedience thereto, as soon as they seem detrimental to the rights of the church or those of the clergy”; and the same Canon Law also says that “without the consent of the Pope, no tax or rate of any kind can ha levied upon a clergyman, or upon any church, whatsoever”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Marshall lias pointed out that the “Manual of Christian Doctrine”, printed in Philadelphia in 1926 under the imprimatur of Cardinal Dougherty, distinctly declares that the state is subordinate to the church in all things referring - to its (the church’s) affairs, and that the church, has the right to annul those laws or acts of government that seem to it injurious to its (the church’s) interests. The book is now in its 48th edition. It is a strange thing that Governor Smith can be such a good Catholic and yet lightly set aside these declarations of the popes and cardinals and councils and canon laws as having only a spiritual application to Catholics themselves and therefore not of any serious interest to others.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark141"></a>The First Resurrection</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Station WBBR on a wav® length ©£ 258 meters by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HIS morning I am to speak to you concerning the first resurrection. That implies that there is more than one resurrection. There is a resurrection of Christ Jesus and the members of His body. This is the first in importance and first in time. Concerning this it is written: “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.”—Revelation 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There will also be a resurrection of the faithful men who died before the first coming of the Lord. Then there will be an awakening of all who are in their graves and a resurrection of all of these to life who are obedient to the Lord during His reign. As the Scriptures declare, “every man in his order” and in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once each year we observe what is called Easter Sunday. Many good people think that Easter Sunday is a Bible name, but it is not. The clergy have led the people to believe that the Bible enjoins upon them the keeping of Easter Sunday, but never tell them why. ■ Many others regard it as a day of hilarity and a time for the exhibition of beautiful clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is the true origin of Easter? The name Easter is a survival from the old Teutonic mythology. It takes its name from the mythical goddess of spring, who was called Estara. Centuries ago the clergy thought well to adopt the day Easter Sunday as a festival day marking the end of Lent, which also is erroneously connected with the true church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is eminently proper that those who believe God’s Word should especially consider this matter in its relation to the resurrection of the dead, for the following reason, to wit: Jesus was crucified on the 14th day of Nisan, which was Friday. God raised Jesus up out of death on the third day following His crucifixion, which corresponds to Sunday.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>The Fact</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">S IT true that the dead are raised up again to life? Satan the adversary says that it is not true. The clergy of the church systems say it is not true. God says that it is true. All of God’s faithful witnesses say that it is true. Of course there are many agnostics, but the time ©omes when every one must believe that it is true or not true. Proof is required, and God has provided in His Word an abundance of competent evidence by which the proof is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is manifest that there could be no resurrection of the creature unless that creature first dies. If there is no death then a resurrection would be not only useless but impossible. Immortality means that which is not subject to death. An immortal creature cannot die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this time the clergy are especially em-phazing the statement that all men are immortal souls, or that every man possesses an immortal soul. By this statement they deny the resurrection of the dead. Their conclusion finds support only in what Satan the Devil has said. For a long period of time the people have looked upon the clergy as the ones who speak with authority in matters of religion. Therefore the people have been led to believe that every man is an immortal soul or has an immortal soul. Such belief nullifies the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mass of mankind believe the false doctrines because they do not know God and they do not know His Word. It is the privilege, yea, the happy duty, of every true Christian to be a faithful witness for God and to tell the people the truth. To tell the people the truth one must know what </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7"> the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">truth,.</span><span class="font7"> This is the time to know the truth, and there never has been a time more important for telling the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The importance of the resurrection cannot be overstated. It is the gateway that leads to life. Without a resurrection there is no eternal life for any of the human family. It is the most beautiful doctrine of the divine program. It is a gracious and unselfish gift from Jehovah. The Apostle Paul expressed it as his greatest d--s<sup>;</sup>n-that he might attain unto the resurrection of Christ, the Head of the new creation. The doctrine, when understood, thrills the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has tried to destroy in the minds of the people this beautiful doctrine. He has succeeded in a large measure. He has used man to teach that the dead are not dead, hence destroying the beauty of the resurrection in their minds. All along the way there have been some, however, who have not been deceived. They have rejoiced in the coming resurrection. The time now is opening when the light of this glorious truth shall be shed upon the minds of the peo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">jjltes of the earth and all will ©ome to know of God’s gracious provision for &quot;bringing life and happiness to the race.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>Bis Resm-reetitm</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE most important question is, Was Jesus resurrected from the dead? It follows, of course, that He must he dead in order to be resurrected. All the Bible testimony is to the effect that He was dead, out of existence, in the tomb for three days, and that on the third day He was I'esurrected. Tne Lord caused the Psalmist David to write these words: “Thou V’ilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.'’— Psalm 16:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle Peter, speaking under inspira-t'on, m Acts 2: 30 32, said concerning the prophit: “Therefore, being a prophet, and ... he seeing this before, spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither hri flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God varied up, whereof we all are witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It follows then from these scriptures that Je-uu vas in hell during the three days. Hell is not a place of torment. The word translated bed, both in the Ilcbicw and in the Greek, means tV tomb, or t.K condition of death. The Hebrew v oid is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sl'tol</span><span class="font7">; the Greek void is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades.</span><span class="font7"> It does w t 'van a plrwe, but a condition. It follows t' “n til'd Jrmw was deed. If there was any d ■ ’J 1l&gt;&lt; 11 is s Jesus settled it Himself v&gt;hen lb Ted : '&lt; u Li'’ ii'iinf ction, in Revelation 1.

<p><span class="font7">The pw'ymi. oi Cod ’ mi foretoM the resur-: »t’or. of ue-uc. The Prcqhct David, i.i Pi\iLn A‘;1R &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: <sup>k</sup>''<sup>!</sup>'ju wik show me the path of</span></p>

Job 19:25 says: “I Know that my Kedceuwr li veth, end that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.” The writers of the Gospels, namely, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, all have given testimony concerning the resurrection of the Lord; and afterwards the Apostle Paul added his valuable testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan knew that if the Lord was resurrected it would disprove his first lie. He had told mother Eve that there is no death. Jesus had prophesied His own resurrection on the third day. Satan set about to so confuse the matter that it would be left in doubt in the minds oS the people. He did not use the common ignorant people to carry out his purpose, but he selected the clergy of that time, the priests and the Pharisees. It is recorded in Matthew 27th chapter that these priests and Pharisees went to Pilate, the governor, after Jesus’ death, and attempted to take every possible precaution to disprove the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The record reads: “The chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, w</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">hil</span><span class="font7">e he was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">yet</span><span class="font7"> alive, After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead; so the last error shall be •worse than the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a w<sup>T</sup>atch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.”—Matthew 27: 62-66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the Jews Saturday was a Sabbath day or day of rest. On that day the Jims were not permitted to do anything. Since they must remain quiet it was a day of great sorrowful r editation for the men and women who loved the Lord Jesus, because He had been wickedly put to death only a short time before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;With the coming of the dawn on Ihe day following, which was the first day of the ue«k some of these good women visited the tor b where the Lord was buried; and, seeing ik t the stone had been lolk I me ay and InA ai.g that the clergy bad caused HL body to be jJehn tnd carried away, they huirud jac.r +o u’l the men. The recoid thereof rei ds as follows. from John 20:1-17:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The first day of the week ccmeth Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth, and coiiieth to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he, stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrap* ped together in a place by itself. Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou! She saith unto them, Because ’they have taken away my Lord, and I know not 'where they have laid him. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Je-</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bus</span><span class="font7"> standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thc=u? whom seekest thou! She, supposing him to be th® gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou i have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Kabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father: and to ray God, and your God.”—John 20:1-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The leaders were foolish enough to believe that their sealing the tomb would prevent the .resurrection of our Lord. And then when the watchmen came and told these clergymen next morning that our Lord had been resurrected they tried to bribe these witnesses to lie about it The records reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away $ while we slept And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7">, and secure 'you. So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly re-'ported among the Jews until this day?'’ (Mat-thew 28:12-15) Thus we see that Satan succeeded in a measure in blinding some people to the truth of the resurrection of our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even today the clergymen still teach that every man, when he dies, goes immediately either to heaven or to hell or to purgatory; and that he is conscious from the moment of death. If their statements are true then the doctrine of the resurrection is wrong. This at least must be apparent to every man who thinks. A creature who is alive in purgatory or hell or heaven or any other place could not be resurrected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then if a layman exposes what the clergy teach and shows the inconsistency of their teachings they immediately cry out: &quot;That man is either a liar or ignorant?’ Such is their stock phrase. I am not going to call anyone a liar. That does not seem to be necessary. I am going to cite the scriptures and let you determine whether or not I am ignorant or a liar, or whether these uncomplimentary terms apply to some one else—to those who have been teaching the people these inconsistent doctrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy teach that there is no death; that man is alive immediately after death, in either hell, purgatory or Jieaven, always conscious. Satan said the same thing to mother Eve; and Jesus, in John 8:44, said that Satan is a liar and the father of lies; and He told the Pharisees that they had the same spirit as their father the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Ecclesiastes 9: 5,10 we read that &quot;the dead know not anything”, and &quot;there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave” where the dead go. Shall we believe the Bible or believe those who teach otherwise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In St. Paul’s day there were those who denied the resurrection of the dead. There are those now who at least by implication deny the resurrection of the dead. One of two things is absolutely certain.: The clergy must back down from their doctrine that the dead are conscious in purgatory, hell or heaven, or they must deny the resurrection of the dead. Concerning the resurrection of our Lord St Paul testified, in 1 Corinthians 15: 3-12:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that h® rose again the third day according to the Scriptures ; and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all lie was seen of me also, as of one bora out of due time. ... Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These scriptures of themselves conclusively prove our Lord’s resurrection, and in the course of this argument I shall cite other scriptures corroborating the same.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>Reason for Death and Resurrection</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N ORDER to appreciate the value and beauty of our Lord’s resurrection it is necessary to understand why He died, and why lie rose from the dead. Adam, the perfect man, sinned and forfeited his right to life. God promised through His prophet, Hosea, that He would redeem man from death. In. the earth there is no man equal to meet these requirements, as stated in Psalm 49:7: “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.®</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The life of the Logos was transferred from spirit to human and He became a man, as stated in John 1:14. As a perfect man He was the equivalent or exact corresponding price of the perfect man Adam. He was made a man that He might taste death for man’s redemption, as stated in Heb. 2:9. He also said, in Matt. 20: 28, that He came to give His life a ransom for many. In John 10:17,18 He said: &quot;Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle Peter, in 1 Peter 3:18, says that Jesus was put to death in the flesh as a man and made alive as a spirit being. The clergy make a great mistake in claiming that Jesus was divine when He was on earth and before He was begotten of the holy spirit. Had He been divine He would have been </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font7"> than a corresponding price for Adam. He had to be an &quot;exact corresponding price’ in order to redeem the race. Jesus was begotten to the divine nature. Therefore, as the Apostle Peter puts it, He was put to death as a man and raised as &amp;&nbsp;divine spirit being. Jesus Himself said that He did not have immortality when on earth. These are His words: ‘Tor as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font7"> him® self.”—John 5:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle Paul, further discussing the matter, says: &quot;And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at th® name of Jesus every knee should bow, of tilings in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory; of God the Father.”—Philippians 2:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle Paul plainly says, in 1 Corinthians 15:20: &quot;Now is Christ risen from th® dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.” Thus he proves that Jesus was the first one ever resurrected. Then again St. Paul says t &quot;And he is the head of the body, the church? who is the beginning, the firstborn from th© dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.”—Colossians 1:18.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Others of the New Creation</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Apostle Paul was a Christian. He was devoted to the Lord. The greatest desire h® had was to be made conformable to the death our Lord, that he might partake of His resurrection. In Philippians 3:10,11 he said: &quot;That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; if &amp;y; any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One becomes a new creature in Christ by this means: First, by believing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Redeemer of mankind | second, by a consecration to do the will of God, m obedience to the words of the Master, as stated in Matthew 16: 24: &quot;If any man will coma after me, let him deny himself, and take up Ms cross, and follow me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then comes justification by faith in the blood of Christ, which justification is granted by Jehovah. (See Romans 5:1-7; 8:31.) One that is justified is counted as though he were perfect as a man in order that he might be called to’th® high or heavenly calling. Concerning such St» Peter says, in 1 Peter 2: 21: &quot;For even hereunto! were ye called: because Christ also suffered fojjp us, leaving us an example, that ye should follOT® his steps.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To follow in the footsteps of Jesus one must be begotten to the divine nature. This is what St. Peter says, in 1 Peter 1:3: “Blessed be th® God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who . . . hath begotten us again unto a hope of life, through the resurrection of Christ from the dead.” And in 2 Peter 1:4 he says: “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One who is thus begotten to the divine nature is a new’ creature in Christ, as shown by the ’Apostle Paul in Romans 6:3: “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death 1” And again, in Galatians 3:27: “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.” Then adds the apostle: “If any man ,be in Christ, he is a new creature”-—2 Corinthians 5:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. John corroborates this in 1 John 3:2: ‘“Now are we the sons of God.” But this new creature in Christ, the Christian, can get life on the spirit plane only by dying. And that is why St. Paul says: Tf by any means I may be made, conformable to his death that I may attain unto his resurrection.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is to this same class that Jesus makes the statement: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.” (Revelation 2:10) These are they who have part in the first resurrection, and concerning these it is written: “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.”—Revelation 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Protestant clergymen have told you for a long while that all the good go immediately to heaven, and that these are the only ones who </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font7"> to heaven; whereas the Catholic clergymen gay that many go to purgatory and are afterwards transferred to heaven. Both show that the dead are conscious after death and before the resurrection. Now all of us must agree that St Paul was a faithful Christian unto death. He did not expect to go to heaven as soon as Me died, because he wrote to Timothy (2 T</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">i-mru </span><span class="font7">thy 4:7,8) and said: “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown ©f righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">shall</span><span class="font7"> give me at that day: and not to m® only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Paul plainly showed that none would be resurrected until the second coming of the Lord. He left no doubt about the matter when he discussed the resurrection, in 1 Thessalonians 4: 15-17: ‘Tor this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain unto the coining of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” It follows then from this statement of St Paul that the resurrection of the new creation takes place only after the second coming of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>The Dead are Asleep</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE clergy say that the dead are conscious in heaven, purgatory or hell. If this were true there could be no resurrection. Jesus says, John 5:28: “Marvel not... all that are in the graves shall come forth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Prophet Daniel tells us where the dead are, when he says: “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” (Daniel 12:2) Which will be the more contemptible in the sight of the people, those who have been trying to do right or those who have misrepresented God and </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hi</span><span class="font7">s Word? The latter, to be sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now I wish to read to you concerning the resurrection of the dead, as set forth in 1 Corinthians 15, and then let you determine whether or not you want to believe the men who have been telling you that they can pray for the dead and do them good while they are dead, or whether you want to believe that “the dead know not anything” (Ecclesiastics 9:5), and that only the Lord ©an resurrect them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1 Corinthians 15:16-18 we read: “For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ b® not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.” You will not© that St. Paul says that if there is no resi» reetion then even the Christians who have died have perished. To perish means to completely go out of existence, never to exist again., unless there is a resurrection. St. Paul here says that even Christians are not in heaven and conscious, but that they also are perished—</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">unless</span><span class="font7"> there is a resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then speaking of the resurrection of the new ch at! on St. Paul further says: “And as we have home rim imago of ffe earthy, ve shall also bear the image of fh» heavenly. Now this I say, h'&lt; P ppii d&gt;at t’mh and Wood oemmt i-berit the Idrulmn of God; mitliei' doth coriuption inherit irn frinpt'on.

<p><span class="font7">Those false doctrines will not stand the light now being turned on them, and that is why the teachers of them become angry and hurl vitu-‘ perative epithets at any man who dares tell the truth. The time has come for the people to »tudy. the Bible themselves and not pennit somebody else to do their thinking for then^ especially when he does not think right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the face of this array of texts of Scripture’ concerning the resurrection will any clergyman have the temerity to deny the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead! And they will ansiver: “We believe in the resurrection.” But I reply that they do not. The very position they take denies the resurrection. If the good are in heaven and alive, why resurrect them? And if they are alive </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font7"> they be resurrected?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the evil are in eternal torment they could not be resurrected for two reasons: (1) Because they are al<sup>;</sup>ve, and (2) if they are in a place eternally they could not be brought out of it. Jf the dead are in purgatory and waiting to be p? at ed out tin n the doctrine of the resume etion doe^ not apply, for you would be getting them out by prei ers and not by the resurrecticm. Any horn of the dilemma the clergy may take, they musl either back down from the doctrine of the resun action or else admit that they are wrong on their eternal torment and purgatorial doctrines, and stop claiming that the dead are conscious immediately after death.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>Beautiful Doctrine</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">npiIEBE is nothing so beautiful and so satis-J- fying as the truth found in God’s ‘Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The truth is reasonable, consistent and satisfying. God’s pl-in as revealed in the Bible shows tk‘&gt;t death m an enemy; that Christ Jesus in order that He might be the Eedeemer and De-bverer of the human family, suffered an igno-m; liui's death upon the cross; and that Od hath raised Him up out of death and rnvibed Dim above all others in the universe, and Urn the Head o! t'<sup>n</sup>e new creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures then show that it pleased the Lead to develop “the house of sons”, which is called the new creation; and these are they who, consecrating themselves to do God’s ivill. are faidiful unto death, representing the Lord, obeying the Lord without regard to what others' may think or say about them. The promise is that these, faithful unto the end, shall participate </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font7"> the chief resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new creation is otherwise called the seed of Abraham and heirs according to the promise. The promise that God made to Abraham was, “In thy seed shall all the families of the earth • be blessed.” St. Paul then says, in Galatians 8:27,29, that they who are in Christ are the seed, of Abraham, and heirs according to the promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All people should lay aside their pi’ejudiees and diligently seek for the truth that is contained in God’s Word, We have nothing to gain by fighting one another. We have all to gain by finding out God’s plan and learning lh.it He is love, and striving to develop the same spirit and disposition. Tims we receive the blessing of the Lord, and it is written: “The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich: and he addeth no sorrow with it.” The truth brings gladness to the heart. Let us seek the truth and follow it. Jesus said concerning truth: “Thy word'is truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On each anniversary of the resurrection ©f cmr Lord all true Christians, whether Cathofie or Protestant, can rejoice. From the fulfilment of prophecy they can see that He who was thus put to death to provide the redemptive price is alive for evermore, and that He has returned and that His kingdom is now beginning. They can see that the time is near in which all true Christians shall be completely resurrected and be for ever with the Lord. Let all who love the Lord and love truth and righteousness be of good courage. Soon restoration blessings shall begin. The Lord is here and the day of deliverance is nigh at hand!</span></p>

Today more than ever before the claim is made by many people that this One whose name is Jehovah says complimentary things about Himself but that the Bilile history itself proves that He did just the opposite things, and that Ue is heartless and. really does net care.

Bead the book of Genesis with open heart and mind and discern for yourself how longsuffer-ing God was in behalf of those drowned in the flood; determine for yourself whether God eared; and decide for yourself who should bear the responsibility for the drowning of the helpless infants. St. Peter tells us that it was the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">longsuffering</span><span class="font7"> of God that waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing; and, furthermore, that the “old world”' was a “world of the ungodly”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">HE Genesis account also explains that all flesh had corrupted itself upon the earth, that the earth was filled with violence (Do you not think that the babies also sufo red from thm earthly violence?), and that in the midst of this ungodly state of depraved man (not depraved God, as Mr. Atheist would claim) Ged's prophet, Noah, was a preacher of righteousness. To whom was Noah a preacher of righteousness.’ For whos<sup>f</sup>* sake did ho preach righlcousrmssf Was it not to the fathers and mothers of these halves, and was it net for the sake of both these parents and their babies, born or unbornt</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us ask further: How long did God’s long-suffering boar with that corrupted and ungodly ■people? Genesis 6:3 replies that God deter mined that from then up to the dropping of the flood from heaven man’s extended days should be one hundred and twenty years. Surely tlwi, if Noah preached that long, God mir-t have eared; and the people, not so numerous as at present, must have bad time to hear the message of righteousness and to take heed to the warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible plainly sets forth that the earth was enveloped in a great water canopy, somewhat We tiie rings around the planet Saturn, and that a mist rose up from the earth, itself to watM the earth, making rain unnecessary. The , Waters right on the earth had been gathered into great bodies called seas, letting the dry land stand out. Hence, with the whole earth inside of the watery canopy suspended all round about it, and with earth’s seas and oceans lapping the ‘ Shores of our continents, we have the phenom<sub>s</sub> ©non described by St. Peter as the “earth stand<sup>!</sup> faig out of the water and in the water”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>Why the People Lost Their Babies</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH foresaw that this watery canopy would break and fall down to earth, and advised the people through Noah to provide against this movement of nature. When the people refused to provide against the impending danger and the flood eventually overwhelmed them, who then became responsible for the drowning of their infants! Was Jehovah obliged to stop the course of nature just to save the babies, because their parents were ungodly and refused to believe God’s prophet, (Noah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Or does the atheist think that the ark which Noah built should have been turned into a nursery to care for the babies while their parents floundered in the flood and swallowed water! Why, the parents did not have the faith even to deposit their babies in the ark for safety, not to speak of taking refuge in the ark themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, had the parents been responsible for the eternal destiny of their babes, or if both babies and parents were to be plunged into a hell of literal fire and brimstone immediately after drowning, God would have been fiendishly cruel. The Scriptures declare, however, that the dead are dead and insensible to pain, and are awaiting God’s further provision for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures also show that Jehovah God has actually made provision for th® future happiness and blessing of all Adam’s genuine descendants who drowned in the flood. Where then is the depravity of Jehovah! Behold rather His mercy, His longsuffering, and His righteousness as well as His mighty power to overwhelm and suppress wickedness.</span></p>

Not only did millions of men fight, Weed and die on the battlefields or return home wounded, erazed and crippled, but thousand* upon thousands of infante and &lt;ddldren perished because of insufficient nourishment, exposure, disease, pestilence and bombardments.

<p><span class="font7">Nor should we forget to ask: Did the preachers and priests care, when they sanctified war, turned religious edifices dedicated to the Prince ©f Pease into war recruiting stations, preached hatred and bloodshed from their pulpits, and prayed to God above (evidently thinking that He eared as little as did they) to bless the guns, cannons, tanks, battleships and armed airplanes of their side that these might the more effectively destroy the lives and property of the enemy!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">rpURN your eyes back once again to a seen® ■*- enacted nineteen hundred years ago, the most touching scene of all human history. It is located in a land which is hallowed as the birthplace of God’s true religion, namely, the holy land of Palestine. Lo, Jesus, the Son of God, stands on trial for life or death. Th® Sanhedrin, made up of priests, preachers, scribes, church lawyers and the holiness people of that day, has ©ondemned Him without warrant to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It s© occurred that in that same year the Roman government had revoked the power of the Sanhedrim® Court to have its victims put to death. Therefore the Jews must hand Jesus over to the Homans because they were the rulers of the world and had the authority and power to a&amp;ecmte the condemned to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Boman Governor named Pontius Pilate, who of course was a Gentile, desires to be relieved of responsibility; so he sends Jesus. to another Gentile, Herod, who was an Edomite. Edomites were, so to speak, half-brothers to the Jews; because their forefather, Edom, was the twin brother of Jacob, who was the forefather of the Jewish people. Herod makes sport of Jesus and, indifferent as to the fate of the Son of God, shuttles Him back to Pilate for final disposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Burdened, Pilate protests the innocence of Jesus to the thousands of Jews assembled before the Pretorium, but the voices of the priests and church leaders prevail above the people in howling for the blood of Jesus. With the suavity of a politician, and for the sake of mere political expediency, Pilate releases the inoffensive Jesus to them, washing his hands with water as he does so, and saying, T&gt;o not hold me accountable for the death of this innocent Man.’ Then tlie march to the site of crucifixion begins.

<p><span class="font7">He not cry out on the cross: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” and then die of a broken heart? Had God cared, why did He not save Ilis Son from the agony of the cross ? Beware—this was the same question that the chief priests and scribes and church elders hurled into the teeth of Jesus as He hung on the cross, saying derisively: Tie trusted in God; let God deliver Him now, if God will have him; for He said, I am the Son of God!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not that Jehovah God was unmoved and loved not Jesus His Son, but because He loved the strayed, disobedient world of mankind did Ue let Christ Jesus suffer ignominy, torture and death on the cross. It is written: “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In permitting His Son to die God was providing the redemption price for the dying h</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">um</span><span class="font7"> mi race. God’s own law required chat “life shall go for life”. In order for the life of Adam to be redeemed and restored to him and all his offspring, the sinless Christ Jesus must sacrifice His human life on earth, surrendering it for ever. Thus only was it possible for Adam and his family to have a basis for receiving life again on this planet, earth, when it is perfected and made a world-wide paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s first human son, Adam, was tested out in Eden and proved disobedient and disloyal. Jesus, as a Son of God on earth, was likewise tested; and His sufferings, even unto the death of the cross, served to prove His obedience and loyalty to God. As Hebrews 5:8 states it: “Though he [Jesus] were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wherefore, as Isaiah’s prophecy, chapter 53, renders it: “It pleased the Lord to bruise him [Jesus]: he hath put him to grief.” [And God permitted the Jew’s and Gentiles, who did not care, to be the ones to do the braising.] “Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>Unbelievers Have Responsibilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">T WAS the unbelievers who assumed the opinion that God did not care, but was smiting and afflicting Jesus as though for personal guilt and sin. But on the third day God demonstrated whether He had observed the afflictions and grief of Ilis Son and whether He appreciated the devotion and faithfulness of Jesus under those most trying conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For “God . . . raised [him] up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.” God “hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name, that... every knee should bow . . . and that every tongue should confers that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the same reason as above described, namely, to prove their loyalty and submission and also their worthiness to be exalted with Jesus, God allows truly consecrated followers of Jesus to bear their crosses and suffer pain, persecution, loss, privation and fiery trials in the world’s present evil state. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nevertheless, </span><span class="font7">though the world forsakes them, St. Peter assures the disciples of Jesus: “He careth for you.” Therefore humble yourselves under God's mighty hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">H THEN, Jehovah God must care for humanity, even amid all its distress and suffering. “While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,” writes the Apostle Paul. It was Satan, the adversary, who was the one who did not care for the human family, when he tempted Adam to sin unto death and thereby plunge himself and his race into all the woes and evils which have plagued us for the past sixty centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was Adam who did not care when he yielded to the temptation in order not to be separated from his lovely wife, Eve, who had sinned and was threatened with death. Adam thus flung the good of himself and of his unborn children to the winds, not taking into consideration the train of sad consequence that would follow upon himself and his progeny. God pro perly penalized that original sin of Adam with death, for He knew what that beginning of sin would bring on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We, standing six thousand years distant from Adam’s disobedient act, can clearly see all the crime, wickedness, inhumanity and trouble to which that one act has led. During all this human w’oe and iniquity Satan has been reigning over mankind; and he has been the one who has been steadily blinding, deceiving, torturing and oppressing the race and alienating it from God. Satan, says the apostle, is “the god of this world”; and Satan therefore, and not Jehovah, is the god who has not cared.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">UST one more objection, says someone. Did it not display lack of care for Jehovah to let Adam and Eve be exposed to temptation by Lucifer, who made himself Satan, the chief adversary of Godf No! Amu who are fathers and mothers, I beg you to call to mind Jesus’ parable of the prodigal son and also Uis parable of the lost sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Call to mind abo that God created man in His own image and likeness. Man was Uras a free moral agent like God, and consequently Jehovah allowed him the liberty to exercise Ills moral sense and be free to choose between good and evil. Logically then Adam must be tested to see which course he would deliberately choose and what reward he deserved, life or death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Likewise, in the parable of the prodigal son, the father let his younger son ask for his share of the inheritance, gave it to him; and let this young, inexperienced lad take his own frae course and journey from his father’s house. Did the father care? Did he not foresee the temptations to which his boy would be subjected and under which he would most likely fall to his own hurt? Why then did he give the son his portion and let him wander away to those who did not have his interests at heart?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ah, the father </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font7"> concerned, but he also realized that his boy had a will of his own and would be bent on doing that will, despite his father’s counsel and warnings. He did not wish the boy permanent damage, but if the boy chose the wrong course then he would let the school of experience teach him valuable lessons and prove to him that “the way of the transgressor is hard”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the wayward son had spent all, and had come to his senses and perceived that the world did not care, when he had gotten his fill of the sordidness and corruption of the world, then he would gladly come back home—if only, yes, if only, the way to return to his father would open up. Then would that son appreciate his father and his goodness more, and he would value righteousness and obedience and would intelligently choose them out of a love for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A wise, loving father was this indeed, yet the parable does not state how much the father’s heartstrings pained him during the absence of his strayed, lost, and, for all lie knew, dead son. Who can tell how the shepherd eared when he left the ninety-and-nine safe sheep and went to seek the lost sheep!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">0 DOWN through the centuries of men’s estrangement from God Jehovah has observed them and has been moved with love for them. Ife who caused the flood of Noah’s day, that same One, says Jesus, “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust,” and Paul reminds us that Jehovah “in times part suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he h'ft not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave ns rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with good and gladness.”—Acts 14:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meantime God has permitted the human family to languish and pine and suffer and di® under the tyranny of the Devil and his servants - big business, big conscienceless politicians, and big hypocritical churchmen; for mankind must eat the fruit of its decision and course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus men have been learning the folly of their own disobedient ways; thus they are proving by experience the inhumanity and loveless-&gt;ess of Satan and all who are controlled by the IteviFs spirit, selfishness; thus they arc learning to know how hard, grating and galling it is to live under Satan’s dominion; thus they are learning to feel to the keenest how lonely, how ‘dark, how desperate, how painful and utterly unsatisfying it is to live apart from the fellowship, the protection and the government of God.

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">HEN the prodigal son was hoboing his way homeward, the yearning father saw him visile he was yet a great way off. lie went out to meet him, and made the first advances to receive him back to his position of sonship. Similarly, just the moment Adam had sinned mid had started down the broad road that leads to destruction, Jehovah foresaw how glad Adam and his race would be some distant future day to return to the Father’s house, to return to Paradise and its blessings and privileges out of -*l.ieh they had been forced through sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s love and consideration for the now wayward Adam tenderly moved Him to make provision for the death oi Uis heavenly Son, the Logos, Jesus, (bat thereby the scarlet-colored sui might be ofiset and the condemnation of Genth rolled away, lie also provided tlmt this faithful Son, Jesus, should establish. a kingdom of righteousness and blessing unon this eanh, that He should detl rone and b’ud Sal an, who is “ I e god of this world’’, and that He, Jesus, should reign thenceforward &lt;../« mankind until J<sup>T</sup>c brih put all enemies undm* ilis feet and destroyed at list even death itsrif.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">ILL the prodigal race of mankind be glad and thankful to return to their Father’s house and become God’s earthly children? The greatest of all prophets, Jesus, pictured it so in the parable; and the Prophet Isaiah describes it in chapter 35:10, saying: &quot;The ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion [God’s kingdom] with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">\Vii] there be joy in heaven ? Jesus assured us that there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repnntetli. Most certainly there will be unbounded and ineffable joy vhen God's kingdom is fully established on earth, Satan is enchained, and Psalm 22: 27 comes true, that “all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. For the kingdom is the Lord’s: and he is the governor among the nations.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">juvenile Bible story radiocast from Station WORD on a wave length of 275 meters by C. D. Nicholson.]</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">[A</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N OUR last lesson we talked about a very great man—great not because he was so well 'known, nor because he was a captain of great armies or a king over great nations, or anything of that sort, but great in the true sense of the word—because he was honest, upright, just and genuine. You will think it strange, but it is a feet that Abraham was one hundred years old, and Sarah his wife was ninety years old, when Isaac was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this time our heavenly Father thought it best to test or try Abraham’s faith in Him, to see if he really believed deep down in his heart that the Lord would fulfil all the promises which He had made to him. He instructed Abraham to take his son, the boy whom he loved more than his own life, the son of promise, to a certain mountain in Mariah, which was a distance of three days’ journey, and there to slay and sacrifice him as a burfit offering unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bright and early the next morning, without telling a living soul, not even Isaac or Sarah his wife, Abraham took Isaac and the necessary wood and fire for the burnt offering, and a great knife with which to slay the sacrifice; and together with two servants he set out on the journey. When toe altar, built of stones, had been completed, and the wood properly placed for consuming toe offering Abraham made known to Isaac that he was to be toe sacrifice. This was doubtless a great surprise to Isaac; but from the tone he was old enough to understand anything he had been taught to reverence, honor and love the Lord; therefore, without murmuring or a moment’s hesitation, Isaac climbed onto toe altar and Abraham tied or bound him to it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do you suppose that this tested Abraham’s faith? When Jehovah saw Abraham raise toe knife which was to slay his son He then knew toe strength of Abraham’s faith—just as thoroughly as if the boy had been actually slain. At this-crucial moment God called from heaven, saying, “Abraham, Abraham!” Abraham, heard and replied, “Here am I.” And the Lord told </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> not to day or lay hands upon his son; “for now,** said He, *T know that thou fearest God, Bering toon hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Abraham heard those comforting words ha looked behind him and lo, there was a real lamb or young sheep which toe Lord had provided for an offering. Isaac was immediately released from the altar and helped his father to kill the Iamb and offer it in his stead to Jehovah as a burnt offering. In deep gratitude to God, Abraham took his son in his arms and embraced him, and together they knelt down before the altar which they had built on this lonely mountain and thanked God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After Isaac’s mother died, he and Abraham were very lonely. Isaac was now about forty years old; and his father decided it was time for him to have a wife, because God had promised that through Isaac’s children all the families of the earth should be blessed. So Abraham sent forth his most trusted servant, Eliezer, to select from his kinsmen a bride for Isaac. Rebecca, who was the granddaughter of Nahor, the brother of Abraham, was the one who toe Lord indicated should be Isaac’s bride. She was young, beautiful and fair; and Eliezer was delighted that his mission had been fruitful. After spending only one night with this family, he and Rebecca and her maid, together with toe other servants, returned to the home of Isaac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just as would be expected, Isaac fell in love with Rebecca the minute he saw her; and in due time they were married. They lived together for about twenty years before the Lord sent them any children. And what do you think—instead of sending them just one little boy or girl the Lord sent them two boys together; that is, twins. One they named Esau and toe other they called Jacob. These little boys then were toe grandsons of Abraham. He doubtless told them of their wonderful grandmother, Sarah, and how toe Lord had promised them a son through whom all the families of toe earth should some time be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the boys were fifteen years old grandpa died, and was buried in the tomb beside their grandmother Sarah. However, Abraham will come back again when Christ’s kingdom is established on the earth, and he will teach the people how to do right and will confirm and explain many of the stories which we read in the Scriptures. That will be a grand time, besause during that time all toe billions of people who are now dead will be brought back to fife again, and all sickness, pain and dying will be for ever wiped away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">1W. ABrahim then got ready to kill Isa^e; and just as he was about to d@ so, an angel of the Lord cried out from heaven and told him to stop. The Bible gives us the amount thus: “The ffingel of the Lord called wato him out of Heaven, and said, Abraham, . . . Lay not thine hand ■upon th® lad, neither do thou anything unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld fey s«, thine only son, from me.®</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">107. God then mused a ram to be eaught in some bushes nearby, so that Abraham could make the sacrifice with the ram instead of with Isaac. The ram represented Isaac. After this, God made His promise to Abraham, which is the most wonderful promise ever made; and wa know that it will come true, because God said it, and God never forgets anything.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">108. The Bible tells us about this premise: “The angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for be-&lt; cause thou has done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; that in tsls»i»g .1 will bless thee, . . . and in thy seed shall ati <sup>1</sup> the nations of fee earth be Messed: taa« few hast obeyed my voice</span></p></li></ul>
