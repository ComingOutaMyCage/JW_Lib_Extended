<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ohn C^ldeii, of the American Management</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mission, writing in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tue Iron Age,</span><span class="font6"> says briefly: ‘’Mussolini's whole program is a sorry compliment to the intelligence of the Italian people. It has been decided that above all things they must not think.'<sup>5</sup> It would be a good joke if after having made the men do just as lie told them in every little thing the women would trip him up by paying no attention to his orders or wishes respecting their dress, and the chances are that they may do that very thing. Even the pope could not bo&gt;s them in that particular. He continues to fume about 'bort dresses and low necks and short sleeves, but in vain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Italy's New Reign of Terror</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FOLLOWING the latest attempt upon Mussolini's life, the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pall Mall Gazette</span><span class="font6">says that never, even in the history of Fascism it. then been t<sup>1</sup> roiighout the bmgtb and bi 'dth of Italv stwh sew e- of horror as veto 1h&lt;-( &gt;&nbsp;enacted.

The demand is nov being made that def ending counsel he denied in political ea»ps, and that the exPremier, Signor Ni.tti, already' in exile, b,e murdered by the first Italian who can waylay him.</span></p>

It is thus evident Liat the Fascists have been trying to invobm France in trouble and got caught at it. It only helps to make a bigger monkey than ever of the wMfle hand-organ castor oil farce. When any government gets so far down in the scale of decency that it has to resort to the i.n-iamous use of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">agents provocateur,</span><span class="font6"> it is a pretty sure sign that it sees the end of its rule in sight. When Mussolini does go, it is the opinion of many that the Italian people will turn suddenly from tyranny to anarchy. This opinion is expressed editorially by the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Beam Radio Works Perfectly</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">/j mcoNi’s new system of transmitting radio Iwl waves in a single direction instead of broadcasting them works perfectly, and is now in operation between London and Montreal. This is unquestionably a great step forward and marks the time v.l in the wot Id will he crisscrossed by the^e <sup>!</sup>’adio waves between the wml'l’s important cenmis of population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sweden's Aerated Concrete</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">XTEW YORK at m e time bad a run on aerated T bread, Irat we never hear of it nowadays. The Sv. edes have applied the same principle to concrete. After the concrete has been fixed they blow it full of gas, which fills the finished concrete with Intie holes. This makes the concrete go farther, and it is said u&gt; be fully as strong as if more solid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Conditions in Rumania</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font6">HILE plenty of Americans were making fools of themselves because the queen of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rumania was visiting here, and while the papers here told how she was entertained at the White House in garments glittering with jewels from toe to crown, not so much mention wi s made of the fact that the general poverty in Rumania is so great that the Rumanian press itself was ilot permitted to publish the details of the queen’s de luxe trip to America. Seventy percent of the Rumanians are illiterate; wages are 25 cents for a fourteen io sixteen hour day; except on Sunday the Rumanian peasants live on boiled dried corn twinned from the ears, the same as the hogs eat raw. Their shoes consist of rough tanned hides laced around their feet. The queen had a private deck for herself and her retinue of thirty-two persons on the steamer Leviathan on the way here, and the party had baggage enough to fill two Pennsylvania Railroad baggage cars.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Swiss scientists, who spent a month living on the top of one of the highest Alpine mountains in Switzerland, have made the important discovery that a certain group of stars sends out radioactive waves stronger than the Roentgen rays. They are hoping to be able to capture these rays and make some use of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">How the Soldier Got the Necklace</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">D</span><span class="font6">URING the World War an Austrian soldier, arrested for taking a pearl necklace from the neck of a famou® &lt;&nbsp;hurch statue of the Virgin, olleied the defense that the Virgin had bowed her head, taken the pearls thorn her neck, and given them to him. The court referred the matter to two bi khans who did not wish to admit that the Virgin statue was not a miracle worker, and who admitted that r-ueli a miracle vas possible. What a way to get a necklace!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Great Macedonian Mlgrsdrsn</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font6">HE great Macedonian migration, in which hundreds of thousands of Greeks weie removed to Macedonia from Turkey, and o‘her hundreds of thousands of Turks were removed from Macedonia to Tiukey, is pretty well settled at last. The Greeks are thriving in their new home. Athens has doubled m population, and Salonika has tripled. This is the largest migration in eenrr.iies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cooperation Spreading Rapidly in Greece</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font6">INCE 1911, when it got its foothold, cooperation has spread so rapidly that in the little country of Greece, which is only the size of West Virginia, there are now 3.655 cooperative societies. one-fourth as many as there are in the whole I ’*ed States. The internal and political condition of Greece is considered greatly improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Plain Living Promotes Longevity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lO'OST people dig their glares with their A.VJL teeth. The oldest roan in the world, Zorah, the Constantinople potter, who was 152 years old. on November 15th last, has always had plain food because he could not afford any other. He has never* been a user of liquor or tobacco, and drinks hut little water. He lias used tea for a hundred years or more.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Swedish and Belgian capitalists which provide for the construction of 900 miles of much-needed railway in Turkey, in the course of the next five years.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Developments in Palestine</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font6">WO large orders of fruit trees have been shipped from Monrovia, California, to Jerusalem, Palestine, recently; and 400,000 vines for the growing of muscatel raisins will be planted in the Holy Land this coming season. Doctor Cha</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font6"> Weizmann claims that Palestine today is the only peaceful spot m a portion of the world seething with unrest. The Jewish invasion of Palestine, he reminds critics, has been not with guns and gunboats but with spades and. Kbovffis. In sever years JOO 000 Jewish colonists have been brought into the country. The Arabs have been paid millions for their neglected lands. The Jews are making such strides that in a few year'- wore the irrigated areas ahjut Haifa will be one of the show places of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Driving Jews Pack to Palestine</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font6">HE Jews who still remain in Poland aie being taxed out of the country. All taxes are assessed by Poles and the taxpayer’s word is never taken. Thousands of the Jews are without relief of any sort, and the only hope for them is emigration to Palestine. These are the view’s of Judge Harry M. Fischer of Chicago, and are supported by the facts. Within three years last past 200.000 Jews who had formerly been in trading and other occupations have become farmers. This is a most encouraging sign. With all his trials, the farmer is the most independent man in the world today. Ue can usually raise enough to get something to eat, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Growth of the Hebrew University</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font6">HE Hebrew University at Jerusalem grows steadily, A new central building is about to be erected which will cost over half a million dollars; Sol Rosenbloom, of Pittsburgh, having left that amount for that purpose. The University will at once undertake to study the system of sacrifices called for by the Jewish law, to endeavor to ascertain their real meaning. This is timely, just what we would expect, and cannot fail to bring great blessings to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Imbeaux Dead Sea. Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HPHE Dead Sea is 1292 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. The hill between the two is 382 feet at the lowest point, namely in </span><span class="font6">the valley of Esdraelon or Megiddo, and water cannot be siphoned higher than 32 feet. A tunnel fifty miles long is an expensive undertaking, and yet such a tunnel has been projected; hut now a French engineer, M. Jmbeaux, proposes to carry the waters of the Mediterranean over most of the 382 feet by the novel expedient of pumping. The pou er required to life great volumes of water to such a height would be mior-mous; but the fall into the Dead Sea is so great that there would he sufficient power thus generated to accomplish this, and enough left over io give Palestine the cheapest and most permanent water power on earth. The water would be pumped from one elevatwn to another I welve times. The canals would be through the cm ter of the richest part of Palestine, practically all of which is now in the hands of Jew’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Details of the Imbeaux Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HpHE Imbeaux plan for electrifying Palestine involves the construction of a canal with 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jocks, gradually rising 382 feet in the valley of Esdraelon. At the summit will be a tunnel 3,300 yards long, beyond which is a drop of 1,200 feet to the Sea of Tiberias, with a further drop of 4.00 feet to the Dead Sea. The gross energy derived would be 617,000 horsepower, of which amount 190,000 horsepower would be needed to pump the water up the twelve elevations. There would be left a net product of 426,000 horsepower, sufficient for all Palestine's power needs. It is believed that the Dead Sea would handle all this extra water by evaporation; but some who have been to Palestine question this, as even the Jordan as it nori is overflows the Dead Sea at times and causes its waters to rise very materially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Eickes of Siberia</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font6"> RUSSIAN who lived for nineteen years in the State of Washington, but who is now in Siberia and a member of the Siberian executive political committee, states that although the Siberian peasant knov s no better than to dump the stable manure into the creek, yet Siberian fields are incredibly rich. He states that in Siberia there is coal by the billions of tons, rivers teeming with fish and forests with fur-bearing animals. Gold, too, is plentiful. He believes that Siberia is the coming country of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Fate of the Rhineland</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TN THE Yangtse liver in China the steamship •*■ “Rhineland” had a slight collision which opened one of its seams. It was not considered serious at the time; but the water leaked in on a cargo of dried beans, the beans expanded, and ripped the triple riveted steel hull apart, and the steamer sank. Building stones can be quarried by the same method. It is slow but sure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Something About Scotland </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By D„ L. Cranston (Scotland^</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font6">COTLAND, a land of beautiful scenery, is dear to the heart of every Scotsman. The schoolbooks of Scottish schools abound with stories of how, in heroic manner, Scotland and Scotsmen obtained freedom from the yokes of their enemies. The “patriotic” Scotsman is proud of his country’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there are certain items of real import, generally withheld from the majority, which reveal that the Scottish people are in a bondage worse than that of their enemies from which they broke free in the past, and which items also reveal that Scotland does not belong to the Scottish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the light of certain facts such expressions as “our country”, “oor ain eountrie,” etc., in reference to Scotland by Scotsmen, are meaningless. Scotland belongs to a privileged few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The story is told of the Scotsman who, in conversation with the American, said that America was not much of a place to live in because it had no nobility. ‘‘What is nobility?” asked the Yank. “Oh well, gentlemen who do not work,” was the reply. “Oh,” said the Yank, “we have them, hut we call them tramps.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The majority of Scottish nobility live in ease and luxury by reason of their possessing land which in the past was stolen from the people. In the 11th century Britain, including Scotland, had the privilege of a visit from one known as “William the Conqueror” accompanied by a mimber of henchmen and retainers. Many today boast of their descent from those who came over with the Conqueror. A book, “Our Noble Families,” says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The history books of out school days supplied us with many fiction--, but &lt;m no part of our national records life, on no part of our national records were they more misleading nonsense than on the Norman conquest William the Conqueror is represented as landing at Hastings with the chnalry and nobility ol France at bis back&lt; . . •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alas that I should shatter a delusion, but it is necessary that the truth be told. The Norman conquerors were not mostly “of blue blood’’; they were, as McKeele the historian rightly says, “the sewn of France”; they were led by one William, styled the Conqueior, who was an illegitimate son of a Duke of Normandy, by the daughter of a tanner in Falaise, and they simply murdered, dabbed and grabbed their way to aSuenee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This same hook shows that the ancestors of our Scots noble families stole, murdered, bribed anti reported to every evil, immoral and dishonest practice to secure the land which they now possess, which land they tax the people of Scotland for the privilege of living upon. Their greed for possession seems to have been insatiable. Very few of them appear to have had any deceucy or honesty whatsoever. They have treated the common people as slaves or worse than slaves. They have received titles and honors from profligate kings. But, as Scotland's national poet says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A prince can mak’ a belted knight, A marqui®, duke, an’ a’ that;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But an b.oneA man’s aboon his might, Guid faith he manna fa' that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nobility have dishonestly and fraudulently used government and public offices for their own enrichment. They have brought untold sufferings to the people. An example of thi« is the clearance of the crofters (those who rented small pieces of land for farm-crofts) from the land in Sutherlandshire, because the then Duke of Sutherland saw that it would be more profitable for himself to rent out the land for large sheep-farms. A brief account of this is given in the work, “Our Noble Families”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Huge farms were deemed more profitable to the landlord than small crofts; and in several parishes, the crofting population got notice to “clear out”. Ciops were standing limit in many eases; the houses had ell been built by the tenants or their ancestors; and they, the tenants, had nowhere else to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true that many of the tenants were offered “al-lotxnentb” on the barren seashore: it is true that they were given the privilege of gathering whelks for food, and of fishing in the rcugh seas of the outer main if they could lav Ihoir bauds on sufficient- money io marebase a boat. Still they had no money for boat purchasing they had no desire to leave their crops at at a landlord's whim, and betake themselves away irom the family croft on the ancestral strath to make corn to grow on soa-shmgle!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They thought that their homes were their own; an,I that, having improved it, tiny had some rights in the soil and in the growing crops. Alas! Down swept the Apaches from Dunrobin Cadle; whole parishes were “cleared”, roof trees pulled down; and the little emits, and frequently the miserable furniture, were committed to the flames, with the women and children weeping by the loadside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tn one er In one or two cases the pillagers did not even trouble to leruove sick persons before setting fire to the thatch;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">women almost in childbirth were thrown on the roadside ; men—everywhere: cruelties and savageries almost unmentionable and unbelievable, clouds of smoke filling the valleys; and the peasantry, that had been a counfiy's pride, were hunted and driven, ragged and. homeless, to a barren eoast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">James Macdonald, w-tired revenue officer, in hi&gt; evidence before the Crofters’ Commission in 3884. said, beside other things:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other cottages I have seen in the act cf being de-nwhihed. leveled with the ground; and I have seen the people, who have occupied them, for days without shelter, bundled together at dykesides, and roadsides and on the beach, waiting for the arrival of ships to carry them fciM the Atlantic, or whereter they were forced to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I hare a distinct recollectkni of seeing a notice that was issued simultaneously with those proceedings, posted upon the door of the parish church, iatimat.ng that any person who was known to have given shelter to, or to base uarbored am of the evicted people, would, m turn, without any warning, be summarily ejected fremhisor her ran house, and be compelled to leave the country: and the harsh decree applied irrespective of any ties of relationship whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These things took place during the early part of the 19th century, in a so-called Christian land; and are but samples of other like proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lest we should be too severe on such noble (?) people, we must recognize that they are but the victims of the present evil order. Brought up from childhood to believe that they </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">superior to others of the human race, and that they are specially chosen of God to have dominion over others, their reason is necessarily warped, and twisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But greater is the responsibility of those who, while claiming to be God's representatives and ministers of His Word, have taught the people to reverence and worship the privileged few as a divine right. They have hailed such an institution as Christendom instead of pointing out ta the people that it is Devildom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But such an order is now come to its end and is in process of passing away. The present world trouble, clearly in fulfilment of prophecy, is proof that the reign of the King of kings has begun, who. in the battle of Armageddon ahead, will destroy this present satanic order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We often hear cries of “Egypt for the Egyptian”, ‘'‘India for the Indian,” “Ireland for the Irish,'<sup>3</sup> etc. With these sentiments we can but concur. For who have better rights to the blessings of Egypt than the Egyptians, of India than the Indians, and of Ireland than the Irish? So why not “Scotland for the Scotsman”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But God's kingdom, the time for whose establishment has come, will bring all these things to pass—and more; for it is written: “The heavens are the Lord’s but the earth hath he given to the children of men”—not to a privileged few.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>300 Days’ Iiadtolgenee and Maybe More </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By 0. Heels.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">P</span><span class="font6">ROBABLY some of our readers would like to know how to get 300 days’ indulgence; so here goes. It’s simple. First, be sure to get a set of beads. Better get two while yon are at iff one big set and a little one. But be sure to buy your beads from the proper dealers. Now on the big beads yon say, “Eternal Father, I offer thee the wounds of our Lord Jesus Christ —to heal the wounds of our souls.&quot; That's all there is to it—and ynu get the 300 days’ indulgence the first crack. And each time you repeat it you get 300 days more! It counts up fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then you can begin all over again on the small beads, and isay, “My Jesus, pardon and mr-rey—through the merits of Thy Holy Wounds ” and you will get 3(f0 days’ iwiulgo.ee again; and each time you say it you get 300 days more. It isn’t 299 or 301. It’s all most carefully figured out so as to land you just a good even 300.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is all up-to-date stuff, too. We got the dope right from the Sacred Penitentiary, and the date when they found it out was January 16,1924. It is all entirely authentic, for it comes via the .Arcbconfrate.rn’ty of Separation, Academy of the Visitation, of St. Louis, Mo., and the leaflet is marked “D. S. B., Imprimatur Joannes Josephus, ArchbisJiop of St. Louis.” You can’t beat that for authority. But you’d better get your indulgences now, while the getting is good. Peradventure, after a bit, you may get some place whore you earit get any more on these terms, and then you’ll be out of luck</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">HOIjE </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jervislt, Cttlctinn,</span><span class="font6"> Pittsburgli, the lead-’*■ ing weekly devoted to Jewish interests, referring to Judge Rutherford’s address to the Jews of that city, said in pait:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Pittsburgh district of Pittsburgh views with especial favor the attitude and work of the International Bible Students Association in reference to the rebuilding of Palestine as the Jewish homeland. The understanding by the non-Jewish public of the greatest problem facing the Jev.ieh people will help greatly in creating a better feeling between Jew and Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here we have an earnest, high-minded body of Christians, trying to bring the Jew closer to the Jewi=h L th and spending money awl effort to arou-e the Jeu- of the world to the fact that the prophecies ci die Old Te-tament are to bo-fulfilled m th&quot; return to Pale-tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The men who are engaged in the work are not a Semites trying to rid this country of its Jews. IV e kn &lt;w some of them. Vie have direusred the matter vitli their.. They are deeply </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font6"> earnest. They believe that the religious life of the whole world will be bettered if the Jews, not all of them, but a representative number '&lt;f them, return to the Holy Land. They believe that the life of the Jews will be bettered. They believe fhere rell come'a religious regeneration through the atmosphne and environment of the ancient home land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s “Brethren” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Contributed)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">("Brothers" or “brethren” are terms which</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J-J usually denote the nearest consanguinity that is, male children of the same parents; but sometimes the expression is Biblically applied to persons of more remote kindrod, of the same nation, or even of those closely united in affection. (Hoe Genesis 13:8; Esther 10:3; Acts 7: 26, 37; 13: 26.) In the New Testament the term is more frequently applied, to that spiritual relationship which the followers of Christ sustain to Him and to each other.—Matthew 12: 50; Romans 11: 10; 2 Thessalonians 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptural passages referring to James, Joses, Simon and Judas, as “brothers” or &quot;brethren” of the Lord, may be principally cited </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">follows: Matthew 13:55; Mark 6:3; Galatians 1:19. Of the last cited passage, Macknight, a Bible critic of note, says: “The Hebrews called all near relations ‘brethren.’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">This</span><span class="font6"> James was a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">son of Alphaeus by Mary </span><span class="font6">the sister of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord’s mother.&quot; That </span><span class="font6">these four “brothers” were in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">reality cousins of the Lord; that their mother was Mary, a sister of the Lord’s mother, and their father Cleophas (otherwise called Alphaeus), is clearly taught in the following passages : John 19: 25; Mark 15: 40; Luke 6:15, 16; Acts 1:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">James, sometimes called James the Less---a distinction, either on account of years or of stature, from the other James who was the son of Zebedee and Salome (Mark 15: 40)—was one of the twelve apostles. (Matthew 10: 3; Luke 6: 15) He is the author of the epistle hearing Ms name, and in the opening vocse of which Ire claims, not the kinship of a “brother” of Jesus. in the ordinary usage of that term, but the relationship of a “servant” of God and of the Lord Jesus. He is mentioned with distinction in Acts 12:17; 15:13; 21:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Joses, one of the so-called brothers of the Lord (see the passages above cited), was another son of the same parentage, being a full brother of James the Less and of Jude. (Matthew 13; 55) See also Matthew 27: 56 and Mark 15:40, wherein the mother of James the Less is also named as the mother of Joses; thus identifying him as one of those mentioned as the Lord’s “brothers” (kinsmen) named in Matthew </span><span class="font6">13: 55. Compare now John 19;25, which proves that Mary the wife of Cleophas is one and the same with the mother of the Lord's “brethren '. It is clear that she was not Mary the mother of Jesus, hut a sister of Jesus' mother. Little is said of Joses in the Now Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Simon is rarely mentioned in Matthew 13: 55 and in Mark 6:3. The foregoing references com-rw pH that is recorded of this Simon in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judas. or Judo (Matthew 13:55: M?’N 6:3: Acts 1:13), is the amber of the geiw/M epistle herring his name. In Jude, verse 1, he <sup>£</sup>-s i.ot eimm to be a &quot;brother” of the L&lt;wd. but HL servant. He doos, however, say that ho is a brother of James and by that statement lie prow’ to us that he and the Judas of Matthew 13: 55 are one and llm same person. He was one of “the twelv&lt; (Luke 6:16) In the list of the apostles, recorded in Matthew 10:2-4, Lis name is given as &quot;Lehbaus, whoso surname was Thaddwus&quot;. He is also tailed Tbeddauis in Mark 3:18. We find him asking the Savior an important cjnostiom in John 14:22; and later locate him with the praying company in the tipper room.—Acts 1 :13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It hardly seems probable, if Mary the Lord's mother had sons and daughters living, that Jesus at His death would have completely ignored such family ties and committed His mmhei into the care of John, who was not a kinsman. (John 19:27) It is more reasonable to hel'a-ve that Josep];, the hmband of Marta was already dead, and that there wore no other members of the family or immediate kinsmen to care for her. In support of such a view, we recall th t no record it- given us of Joseph being at the crucifixion, nor at the burial, or or with the- brt th? in in the upper room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No d<sup>r</sup>ubt Satan hrs j'osNred the gent wf misconception that Jamc= and .loses and Mnm i and Judas were the children of Mery the L&lt; d's mother (Matthew 13: 55), so that when we L-.tor read that Alphams and not Joscnb was father (Acts 1 :13) a reflection migld be east upon Mary and thus ii essentially i;p&lt; n the birth of Jesus Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">See Mary’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in the New 7estcmtnt</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name Mary has been frequently Jy confused by those who read the Serb wres carelessly. It is clear that there aie no less than six Marys mentioned in the New Testament, as follow s:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus. (Luke 1: 27) She was a cousin of Elisabeth the mother of John the Baptizor. (Luke 1: 36) The sacred history records hut few incidents of her life. (See John 2:3; Luke 8:19, 20.) She was present at the Lord’s crucifixion. (.John 19:25) She is also mmtkmed ; s tnvuig the praji-&gt;g company in the upper loom at Jerusalem after Hit, ascension.- Acts 1:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. Mary, a sister of the Lord's rioiher, the wife of Cleophas (John 19: 25), other; i«c eaPed Alphams. (Matthew 10:3: Lake 6:15; This Mary was the mother of the I.ord’s ' L Nireif (cumins), viz., James the L&lt; ss, Simon, Jude and Jews. (Matthew 13: 55; 27:56: Mark 6:3) She was &quot;the other Mary’ who was pr &gt;&nbsp;'em at the- errwifixion and buiial of the Lord (Matthew 27:56-61), was among those who went to embalm Hi- body (Afark 16:1-10), and she also met the lison Lord.—Matthew 28: 9.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font6">ITHOUT question, the most remarkable river in the whole earth is that of Jordan, situated in the land, of Palestine—a land beloved by the Jew, held sacred by the Christian, and viewed with fanaticism by the Moslem.

<p><span class="font6">The mow during the summer months condenser, d, vaporous clouds that envelope it, so that abundant dews descend, and this while the surrounding country may be parched. How many a thirsty traveler has looked longingly at the cool, pleasant and majestic prominence of Hermon ! The mountain formed the northernmost. boundary of the tribes of Israel; therefore as a mountain represents, from the Bible standpoint, a kingdom, so from the point of view of its majestic height, its northern aspect and its relationship to Jordan, Mount Hermon represents God’s kingdom throne, from which spring the blessings of life and peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tn evidence thereof we have the voice of the inspired sweet singer of Israel: “Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. ... As the dew of Hermon, that comcth down upon the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.” From this expression one recalls the divine blessing upon our first human parents, since then the tragic drama of ages. Also in after days on Mount Hermon was enacted the scene of the transfiguration, picturing in L&lt; autiful symbolism, the ultimate triumph and sdon of Messiah’s kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Now behold a contrast! There high up, piercing the azure of the heavens and clothed with its glistening mantle of snow, stands Mount Hermon—Jordan’s source. Now look a hundred miles to the south and see that sullen, tropical, “bottomless” lake in the heart of the earth. It seems never satisfied, but receives Jordan’s torrents apparently without troubling to raise its level. That lake is known as The Dead Sea— the end of Jordan, and a fitting illustration of the end of all those who are judged down. But there are mam* other wonderful features, connected with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6">ordan river.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">URTNG the rainy months Jordan is fed by hundreds of little tributaries that flow from the ravines of Hermon. The waters flow through marshy land to the river which eventually arrives at an expanse termed Lake Merom or Lake JJideli, which is about eight miles long and about six miles wide at its northern end. Thence it runs southward to a triangular point, where the Jordan leaves it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font6">E HAVE already noted the fair beginning of the Jordan river, and followed its rapidly descending current to Merom, which at first glance seems destined to stay its waters. Then w* have noted how it rushes onward and downward with wonderful impetuosity to Galilee, where again it might seem to have met its end; but that nevertheless it flows onward, plunging through twenty-seven rapids to its final resting place in the Dead Sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During its strange, serpent-like passage through what is known as the Jordan Valley, the river seems to make every effort to escape. It darts to the right, then to the left, now apparently upward and then violently downward, so deviously and capriciously as to present the unparalleled spectacle of a course of only sixty miles straight-line measurement increased, through it&quot;S windings, to nearly 200 miles. How like the course of sin and death is this! The sin-cursed human family, strive as they may to stay the inevitable, find their efforts futile; and downward they eventually plunge to oblivion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Were we to compress our Lord’s earthly ministry into a few words we would say that He </span><span class="font6">went from Nazareth to Jerusalem. At Nazareth, a perfect man, full of glory and vitality—at Jerusalem, the Man of Sorrows, despised, rejected and crucified as a malefactor. Nazareth, be it noted, is on the same latitude as the extreme southern portion of the Sea of Galilee, from which Jordan resumes its eventful course, Jerusalem, on the other hand, is on the extreme northern latitude of the Dead Sea. where Jordan empties itself. This suggest-. how our Lord took the sinner's place; He ended iun in the depth* of the Dead Sea, however. h”t of ly at its ortixu’w —at Jerusalem, “the city of the great King!” —Matthew 5: 34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The River Jordan therefore was the only appropriate place for Jesus to symbolize Tr» om-secration even unto death.; vhile His ab*ocjaH&lt; priesthood was likewise pictured by auotlec important ev ent in the history of the same m er. —See Joshua, chapters 3 and 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">John the Baptist immersed repentant simims in Jordan as a token of their desire to conicrm to God's will, putting to death everything contrary to His will. (Matthew 3:1-6) Naamam the Syrian general, was cured of his leprosy (typifying sin) by immersing himself, at the command of Elisha, seven tunes in the River Jordan—his flesh becoming as that of a little cliilcL—2 Kings 5:1-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus is shown the treble significance of the Jordan river: First, the river’s course—aptly representing the dying processes of the human race which lead on to destruction; second, the act of immersion in its waters of the sacrificial priesthood—symbolizing the putting to death of justified human nature so that the world may live; third, the act of immersion of sinners in Jordan—picturing how that sin and selfish propensities may cease to exist and God’s will maybe done in heart and mind, which in the case of humanity will result in perfect health and everlasting life on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes ’mid scenes of deepest gloom, Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom, By waters still, o’er troubled sea— Still ’tis His hand that leadeth me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And when my task on earth is done, When by His grace the victory’s won; E’en death’s cold wave I will not flec^ Since God through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jordan</span><span class="font6"> leadeth me.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The water of the Dead Sea is totter and salt, far beyond that of anv ocean.' It acts on the tongue like alum, sum? ■- the eye Vke camphor, produces a burniuc i irking sensation to the skin, and stiffen* tin tai'- rto pomatum.

<p><span class="font6">It is estimated tlmt the Jordan empties into the Dead Sea about six million tons of water daily, and yet the surface of tie sea, does not seem to rise! This natural phenomenon of'the Dead Sea is due to the intens’ty of evaporation, even to the extent of clouds and mists. Thus it is with death; being the condition bf oblivion, it can never overflow.—Job 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the immediate vicinity of the Dead Sea stood the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which at the given ia&lt; ment were overcome by fire and biiinsl&lt;me. All. thiw added to the still present odor of sulphur, gives vividness to the svmbolism of Divine wrath and destruction.—Genesis 19:23-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sunken condition of sin and death is further evidenced by the amazing depth of the Dead Sea. Its surface approximates 1300 feet below the Mediterranean, and soundings reveal that it is as deep again below the level of its waters, making it a veritable ‘&quot;bottomless pit”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From this strange place of desolation, Hermon, in the far away distance of the northern sky, may still be seen. There it has stood, age after age, like some sacred, solemn sentinel, ever watching the unrestful course of Jordan till it has readied its place of burial.—See Rom. 1:18. from the bondage of sin and death, even those who are in the actual state of death. (John 11: 23-26) Therefore, fitting to our picture, this may be referred to as the overcoming of the Dead Sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Ezekiel in his God-given vision of the temple, which relates to Messiah’s reign, sees a stream of pure water issuing from the door of the sacred edifice. The waters increase in volume, depth and intensity, and find their way to the Dead Sea, which thereupon undergo an amazing change. They become pure, sweet and fit to drink; and soon fish of many kinds are seen in vast shoals. Thus is portrayed the blessing of all the families of the earth, which will mean the resurrection from the dead.—Genesis 2<sup>;&gt;</sup>: 16-18; Ezekiel 47; 1 Corinthians 15:20-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bearing in mind that this latter picture (while very true in that which it corroborates) is but a symbolism, and will therefore have no exact literal fulfilment, yet it is interesting to note that scientists, while having little or no interest in theology, yet oftentimes fulfil unknowingly the divine purposes. The following, culled from the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dally Mail,</span><span class="font6"> is of some import to this end:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The area of the Dead Sea, one of the &quot;deadest” spots on earth, is shortly to become a center throbbing with life and industry. The Crown agents for the colonies have invited applications for rights to recover its chemical wealth for sale in the world’s markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Dead Sea, lying over 1000 feet below the level of the Mediterranean, io so crammed full of chemical salts that it is impossible for a man to sink in it. Bathers can actually sit in the waters, read a book and hold up a sunshade at the same time. It is, however, easy enough to overbalance and get a nasty drink of the exceedingly strong saline. No fish can live therein, and its neighborhood has the most desolate appearance imaginable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Soon all this will be changed, and the shores will be concerted into a hive of dynamos and machinery. The Dead Sea contains no less than thirty billion tons of mixed salts, of which ten billion tons are common salt. The remainder i» composed of potassium chloride, magnesium bromide and other chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus Palestine will be the richest country in the whole world for the valuable potash resources, which can be extracted from the water by the simple process of evaporation and crystallization by the natural heat of the sun. Incredible though it may seem, a quarter of the contents of the Dead Sea is solid matter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">So here we have it! In the Dead Sea there are chemical salts which in their present form are poisonous and deadly. By means of the surfs dynamic energy they will be changed, and will assist in forming the basis of valuable manures to feed the soil; thus the earth will be- enriched thereby and made more and, more productive, so as to “blossom as the rose”.—Isaiah 35:1<sub>;</sub> 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These deadly salts in the Dead Sea well represent the bitter experiences of evil through which mankind, have passed. Though deadly in themselves, yet under the beneficent powers of the “Suu of righteousness” (Malachi 4:2) these very hitter experiences will be turned io a useful , purpose. They will enrich the soul by a firm in* dination to the Lord; thus each willing heart will become a pleasant garden, full of grace and truth: “For as the earth brings forth her hud, and as the garden emisefh the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord &lt;lod will cause righteousness and pxvJ.se to spring forth before all the nations.”—-Isaiah 61:11«</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Bible is the most remarkable Book in the world. As a whole it is a collection from the writings of some forty different men, including kings, priests, poets, lawyers, doctors, scribes, seers, herdsmen and fishermen. Their writings cover a period of approximately 1700 years, yet there is one central theme running through them all, the kingdom of God. They dovetail into each other in such a way that there is no other explanation than that they are of divine authorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible radiates an influence for good. and ft is remailmble that without exception those who carefully follow its principles and precepts become more enlightened, peaceful, just, loving and happy. It contains the fundamentals of the sciences of religion, astronomy, geology, government, sociology, humanitarianism, and every other branch of knowledge needed for the uplift and upkeep of man. As to its geology, Prof. Dana has well said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first thought that strikes the scientific reader is the evidence of divinity, not merely in the first verse of the record and its successive fiats, but in the whole order of creation. There is so much that the most recent readings of science have for the first time explained, that the idea of man as its author becomes incomprehensible. By proving the record true, science proves it divine; for who co Ad have correctly narrated the secrets of eternity but God Himself? The grand old Book still stands; and this earth, the more its pages are turned and pondered, the more will it sust ain and illustrate the sacred Word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Similar testimony lias been given by those who have made a careful study of the Bible’s prophecies and compared them with recorded history. The evidences of divine foreknowledge are multiplying as lime goes on and as new records are being found corroborating the Bible record and prophecies. Those prophecies have been stated in various ways: Some in simple language, as in Daniel and Isaiah; others by illustration, as the official position and actions of prominent men, such as Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Solomon, and others; or in the experiences of nations, as Israel, Egypt and Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other prophecies have been stated in symbols and cryptic phraseology, as in the books of Ezekiel and Revelation; still others are in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">form of beautiful poems, which, breathe forth </span><span class="font6">a spirit of hope and good cheer; while others are in the nature of moving-picture glimpses </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">prominent leaders, such as David, Nehemiah and John the Baptist. The whole Bible vibrates with divine energy, wisdom and power. To get in touch with this .mighty power one needs </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">first </span><span class="font6">a reverence for God, an honest heart, and a sincere desire to know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the Rel&amp;sed</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Our study is of the moving-picture experiences of David, the must prominent of the kings of Israel and the most loved by the Jews of all their national heroes. The name David means beloved. The story of the life and times of David, taken as a simple tale of history, is fascinating in the extreme, and has thrilled tbo hearts of millions, both Jews and Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The nations surrounding Israel were al that time steeped in the darkness of heathendom and ignorance. The lives of all subjects were in the hands of their despotic rulers and without appeal. Honor and honesty were almost unknown. Even among the children of Israel themselves, pride, selfishness, egotism and personal gratification were very prominent. Against this dark background stands out the figure of David like </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">brilliant light, casting luminous rays not only upon events of his own age but also far down into the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">David was thoughtful of others, just in his dealings, benevolent and generous to a marked degree. He never accused another of his own errors. Above all, he held himself strictly accountable to Jehovah God, Sind in His law did he meditate day and night. His humility before God is remarkable. That he made mistakes is no marvel. The marvel is that he did not make many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting to note that the Bible makes mention of Jehovah God, under various titles, over 10,000 times; and of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, over 2300 times. And third in prominence comes David, who is mentioned over 1200 times. This is significant and awakens interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But we are not left to guess why this is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">so. </span><span class="font6">The Bible definitely informs us that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">David was </span><span class="font6">used by Jehovah for a special </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">work, part of </span><span class="font6">vhieh was to shadow forth a greater work by One to follow. The Apostle Paul states plainly in 1 Corinthians 10:11. that ‘all these things happened unto them for easamples [or hopes], and they were iceorded for our admonition’. David understood thus to some extent in our reading in 2 Samuel 7:8, 9 that the Prophet Nathan was sent to say to David, -‘Now therefore Giak thou say unto David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, 1 took thee from the slmepcete . . . to bo inter ovm- my people Israel. I was with, thee whithersoever thou ven rest, and havo cut off ail thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To get a better light upon these pictures it is well that we first note the stage and the background. Moses had led the children of Israel from Egypt to their promised land. Ds long as they endeavored to live up to the covenant which their fathers had made with Jehovah at Mt. Sinai they prospered, Vu piol-cted and Happy, living peaceful pastoral lives, and were in peace with the sunounding nations. But many of the Israelites thought that their lives were much too simple, and they looked with longing eyes at the gaudy glitter and tinsel of the royalty of the kings of their neighbors, and the show of their armies and chariots of war. and the voluptuous ceremonies in connection with the worship of their heathen gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They forgot the glory and strength of their own God and went to serve the idols of their heathen neighbors. Jehovah let them go. and they were soon enslaved by their idolatry enemies. They soon learned the difference between being under the protection of Jehovah and the cruel heel of hard taskmasters. Whenever in their distress they cried unto Jehovah He heard them and sent deliverance by some chosen servant, who’&gt;i fit raised up fi&gt;r T? oc.-as on. Of such were Othniel, and Samson and mhers. But they would forget again and again. This continued for for about 450 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finally the Israelites determined to have a king of their own. and demanded that Samuel their prophet end judge make their choice. Samuel took the matter to God, who told him to listen to them, explaining that they Lad roi rejected Samuel hut Jehovah Himself. God indicated one Saul the son of son of a Benjamite chief. Saul was well fitted physically to bo a king; strong, handsome, head and shoulders above all his fellows besides possessing influence which his parentage gave him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At that time there was no centralized government in Israel, such as wp would call a government today. The administration of public affairs and of individual justice was as it is among the Arabs of the desert today—usually in Vu hands of the patriarchial heads of each family, who held their positions imtd death. Saul was without experience in public affairs. but God granted him wisdom for his nc<sup>fi</sup>ds. Al that time the Israelites were under the Philistine yoke and they were very heavily humbled. Tt was almost impossible lo organize a centralized government. The people were not anxious to accept the added load of taxation, and of conscription of sons and daughters to be servants, in course to support royalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">SauVs Jealousy of David</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">G</span><span class="font6">OD was with Saul and he was able to threw off the Philistine yoke. For a while he was faithful to Jehovah, hut later he became wilful and disobedient, and God withdrew His blessing and protect ion from him. Then Saul became bitter, morose and jealous. He feared that Samuel had been sent by Jehovah to anoint David to be king instead of his own son Jonathan. He persecuted David and at limes hunted him as tor a wild animal, and tried in many ways to came his doalh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But David was specially protected by Jehovah. Twice was Saul in the power of Dav'd; and according to all tin* rule,, of that age David should have taken qu'ol. a Ivnntage of the opportunity and killed Saul, t*&gt; make himself secure r Lis own ch ration lo tlio thione. But he refused, -mying that he would m.t tmieh mm wliom G- d H’d anointed. IF*- experience road like a romance. lie had k ’lol large g; me, such as the lion and the bear ; |<sub>(</sub>&gt; had killed the giant Goliath. King Saul bad oven given bun his own daughter for a wife, thinking thus to be able to ensnai'<sup>1 </sup>him. Thus his own father-in-law was his bitter enemy, while the king’s daughter, David’s wife, loved him and warned him to escape her father's wrath. Jonathan, the heir apparent to Saul’s throne, was likewise a true friend of David, and assisted him io escape his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finally Saul and three of his sons wore slain in battle, and the way was opened for Darn'd to Iwcome king of .Israel. But the nation was in very had condition. The defeat of Saul had left Israel at the mercy of the Philistines, and tho</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nation itself was rent by civil strife. David was a man of extraordinary bravery and ability. Picking up .the tangled ends of rival tribes with personal strife and jealousies amongst their leaders, David within the short space of forty years had amalgamated the whole into one of the strongest nations of his time, with borders extended to the river Euphrates on the north and east, and to Egypt on the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His government was thoroughly organized in every department, and all the surrounding nations* were soon paying him tribute. It is estimated that at the death of David Israel was the richest nation of that time. The kingdom was at peace with all her neighbors, and the God of the Israelites was dreaded by all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David proved himself to be a great general, a statesman, a counselor, a musician, a men of letters, a lawyer, and a wise, loving and just king. Above all, fie endeavored to servo God with a pure heart His Psalms are poems which rank with the purest gems of literature of all ages, and breathe forth a devotion to God such as could emanate only from a pure heart. Well has one writer said of the Psalms:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no other book of praise so pregnant with expression of the heart’s emotions under all the vicissitudes of life, or so adapted to all climes and all ages a-. to be the universal medium of praise for all nations of the voi Id. No wonder the Israelites love David as oa« of their brightest stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David realized that he prefigured a greater One to come, whose glory and power would fill the world. God had said to him, as recorded in Psalm 132:11 : “Jehovah hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn away from it; of the fruit of thy body shall I set [one] upon thy throne'’; and again in Psalm 89: 3, 4: ‘T have made a covenant with my chosen; I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will 1 establish forever, and build up thy throne to all generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Jeremiah, in chapter 23, verse 5, says: “Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise up unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.” In harmony with these promises the angel Gabriel announced to Mary, the mother of Jesus, “Thou shalt bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. lie shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: . . . and of his kingdom there shall be no end.”— Luke 1:31-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">David a Prophet</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270406_files/g_E_19270406-15.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">David was also a prophet, and writes in Psalms 2, 72 and 145, from which we quote as follows: “Yet have I [Jehovah] set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. . . . Ask of me and 1 will give thee Ilie heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for* thy possession. Thou shall break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In his day shall the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth. Jie shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the liver unto the ends of the earth. . . . Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“They shall speak of glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power, to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These prophetic statements clearly connect up David and his reign with Christ and His reign. AVe are warranted, therefore, in closely studying the life of David that we might understand how his life was a series of pantomime pictures prefiguring history. Lot us note some of these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David was specially chosen and exalted by Jehovah. Jesus was specially chosen and elevated by Jehovah, as it is written, “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh” and say unto the people, “I have sot my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” And St. Paul adds, “So Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest David was persecuted by Saul, one whom Jehovah had appointed to a position of special honor; yet David rvould not put forth a hand to touch the Lord’s anointed. So Jesus was persecuted and finally crucified by Satan, one whom Jehovah had highly honored in the kingdom of heaven, but who later rebelled and became an enemy of God. Yet would not Jesus interfere with Satan, determined to wait Jehovah’s time to remove Satan and all his fellows—Jude 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nation of Israel was in a deplorable condition when God called David to the throne. David brought it to the highest standard ever reached by any nation up to that time. Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is to take the kingdoms of this world, wrecked and ruined by Satan, and make of them one mighty nation, highly organized, the glory of the earth, with peace, prosperity, happiness and eternal life for all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isaiah has declared (9x6,7), “His name shall he called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The .Prince of P^aee. Of the increase of his government and of peace them shall be no end, upon the throne-of David, upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice front- henceforth even for ever. &quot;The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perforin this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aside from Jehovah God, David is the most prominent person in the Old Testament. Jesus Christ is the most prominent One in the New Testament. In 1 Kings 15:5 we read, “David did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned net aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his.life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. Of Christ ■we read, in Matthew 17: 5, “And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We might continue the comparisons, but these are sufficient to prove that David was the prototype of Christ: and these facts greatly increase our reverence for the Bible, and for Jehovah God, who sent it to us through His holy prophets and the apostles, that we might have greater confidence in the God we worship. His Word is indeed a mine of rich treasures; the deeper we go the more we find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Society Girl Becomes a Poor Clare</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">/And papers are making much of the fact Afi that a San Francisco society girl has become a nun of the order of Poor Clare. Henceforth she ■will eat but one meal a day, wear sandals only, with no stockings, live in a cell which has only a cot, Washstand, candle and chair, spend the hours between midnight and 2 a.m. praying, and will speak to others only in case of necessity. If anybody can find anything in the Bible authorizing such a course of nonsensical conduct now is the time to tell it. The Lord expects His followers to be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font6"> the world (but not of it); He does not expect theni to be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">out</span><span class="font6"> of the world and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font6"> themselves off from every creature comfort and opportunity of usefulness to others. The Lord Himself did. not do that. He liked to eat and drink when hungry<sup>-</sup>, and did so: as is proven by the fact that the scribes, Pharisees amd hypocrites accused Him of being a glutton and a wine-bibber. What, the Lord wants His people to do is to live in the world like other people, but to show by their daily lives and teachings that it is possible i«&gt; bo time-Christians in everyday life.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The First Farmer and His Two Little Boys</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">[A juvenile Bible story radiocast from Station WORD on a wave length of 275 meters by C. D. Nicholsoa,]</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font6">X OUR last study we learned about a wonderful man who was never a little boy, about the home which God prepared for him and what a beautiful place it was: and 1 trust that all of you felt that you would like to live in a home similar to the garden of Eden, for this is the name of the garden &gt;n witch Adam l<sup>:</sup>ved. We also learned that God made a woman for Adam's companion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While Adam and Eve were living in the garden of Eden, surrounded by their many pot animals and birds, and while the Lord came to walk with them every evening, there was another person present who could not be seen by Adam ard Eve. He we&gt;s a snlrit b Ing. Do you know nhat a spint Hire iw God and alt the angels are spirit beings. but we are not able to see them; hut they are just as reel as we are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name of this particular spirit being was Limiter, the Son of the Morning. He was placed there by our heavtmly Father as a kind of policeman, to watch, look after, care for and protect the first human family. Lucifer was really a wonderful being when placed in the garden of Eden; hut he began to think bad thoughts, and before long he began to do evil things and tell lies to mother Eve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the many pets which God made and gave to Adam was one called the serpent. What this animal looked like we cannot be certain; but we know that he v as the v, isest among animals, and was chosen by Lucifer to help carry out his plan of getting the human family to serve him instead of our heavenly Father. And right there this wonderful angel Lucifer became Satan, the Devil, the Adversary—and now you know where the Devil came from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God gave all the fruit trees, grass, flowers and herbs to Adam, with the exception of one tree which stood in the middle of the garden. This tree boro a very peculiar kind of fruit, which God used as a test to see whether<sup>1</sup> Adam and Eve loved Him enough to obey just one little request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am sure that Adam and Eve would have always remembered and obeyed that one request if it had not been for Lucifer who, by using the serpent as his tool or spokesman, persuaded mother Eve to partake of this forbidden fruit In addition to this, she also persuaded Adam to eat of this fruit. That evening, ’when the Lord came to walk in the garden, instead of Adam and Eve coming to meet Him and talk with Him, they went and hid themselves in the bushes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am sure that Jehovah felt very sad m Aime that the man and woman and woman whom Fe ha I n .idr vuuM Ltd to lL ju»t u»e Lt'ie d* i&lt;<sub>o</sub> * fo-di He had requested of thmn, after </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font6">11 F- h° J Aw » for A em. Therefore, because of their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span class="font6"> -ebc-dionce, God sent them out of the safety of Eden into a wild country, where they had to work to prm'de a homo, food and eldhinn for them,wives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Things were very different in that wild country vl’cre Ahn mid e now hid to foe, from what they had enjoyed in the garden of Eden. They had to plant seeds and cultivate their crops and raise fruit and vegetables, So Adam became the first farmer. For clothing they could use the skins of animals. The animals which God had given to Adam for pets now began to be afraid of him: and instead of coming when he called theni they would run in the opposite direction, for fear of being killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A year or two after Adam and Eve moved to this new, wild country the Lord sent them a little baby boy. You see, after all, God had not really forgotten them. He didn't come to walk with them or to talk with them any more; but He loved them still, and did many things for them, just as He does for us today; Cain was the boy’s name, and ho grew very rapidly. Within a few years the Lord sent Adam and Eve another little boy. We are sure that God gave them some Utile girls, too; but the Bible- docs not tell us vhai their names were, or just vhen they were born. The name of the second boy was Abel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I would like to tell i on more about Adam, who was the first farmer, and l.m two little boys, one of whom was a farmer hke his daddy and the other a shepherd boy. But our time is up now; and we will have to stop until next time, when we shall learn something about &quot;Why God Bent the Rainbow”. See if you can find out what the answer is,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Behold! I Make All Things New</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">[Radiocast from Station V BBS on a wave length of 416.4 meters by E. L. Beaulieu.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">H</span><span class="font6">OW often do the best laid human plans fail of materialization! How frequently are our ideals shattered, our resolutions broken, and our hopes dashed to the ground! In spite of our best endeavors, things go wrong; and sin, sorrow, siekir'ss and death are ever present. But notwithstanding all this, w can now take fresh courage; for the old order is passing and a new wei Id is now beginning. Earth’s new King now is here with a special message for us. The Bevelator tells us that He who sat upon the throne said, Be he’d, I make all things rev.—Kev. 21:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The meaning of this text has not been appre-c w&lt;d Wmany peepb Hawe tic y cannot eom-jw. &lt;md how condition</span><span class="font6"><sup>0</sup> can ever be much different from now,. Man’s efforts through six ili&lt; u- uid yp-m of history have produced a ci '{'ration which we now see on the verge of dawn Hence many exclaim: What new thing can be tried that has not been thoroughly tested and found wanting!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Admittedly man is at the limit of his ability; but man’s extremity will be the means of teaching him to look beyond his own power to the power of the Almighty Jehovah, who alone can make things new. The Creator of the heavens and the earth has the power to rectify human affairs. He has been waiting until man would realize his own insufficiency. Now that time has nearly arrived, and God is taking steps to bring in a new order—a complete reversal of everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Man’s troubles began in the garden of Eden. They began with the deception of Eve by the arch-criminal of all ages, Satan the Devil. Mankind, having entered into sin, soon reaped its results—sorrow, suffering and death. Lack of harmony with Jehovah God, vdio is the personification of His laws of justice and righteousness, is &gt;’ii. It movitahlj brings, in accordance with lav*, the penalty. God cannot allow anything to continue to exist in His universe which is out of harmony vitli Himself, because it would work injwiice to His creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The jewalts, therefore, for sin is death. For the receiving of the penalty, man was forced out of the garden of Eden into the inhospitable earth. The earth in general was unfinished and not ready for man; onh the garden had been fitted for him. We read, ‘'Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of thy life: thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and ihuu s-halt eat the herb of the field: in the sweat of thy face slia.lt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wasl thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return.’’ — Genesis 3:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The descendants of Adam’s found themselves competing with each other for the limited good things of the earth. Poverty led to increasing selfishness. No doubt this spirit was fostered by Satan in order that he might increase his hold upon mankind; and mankind mankind learned his enmity and began to oppose on- another. Competition is With With varying ehaiactem and changing characters the play has gone on until the present time, with but slight differences in +he method of a&lt;-ting. “One generation passi-tli away, and another generation cometh. . . . The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be: and that whwh is done, is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.&quot;—Ecclesiastes J : 4, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, “He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.” How can this be? To bring about a complete change in earth's affairs, three things must take place: There must be a change in nilership; there must be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">change in the economic conditions; and there mu«t be a change in man’s heart. It is this three-fold change which is prophesied.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The old world has ended, and is even now passing away.' We see that our civilization is facing its final downfall. The ending of the old premises the beginning of the new. If we have shown by chronology and by fact th“ ceding of the old. ihen we have demonstrated the beginning of the new. It but remains for us to discover the character of the iw. Jehovah declares: “T have set my king; upon my holy hill of Zion (Psalm 2: 6) What does tlifi. mean ? To answer, it will be necessary to jcfor agam to the garden of Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A penalty was there pronounced upon Adam. His posterity inherited the ocondemnation and disability. A redeemer must be found who can restore mrn to harmony with God and His laws. A Redeemer must be found who can overcome the old ruler, Satan, and establish another rule;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">one who can bring about a restoration. This Redeemer has been found. ‘&quot;And the Redeemer shall come to Lion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.’’ (Isaiah 59: 20) The Redeemer n who has come to Zion is, of course, none other than the Son of God, who has now taken His great power and begun His reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two kings cannot reign in the same kingdom at the same time. Clw or the very fri-t acts, theietore, in tin it.g’ of earth’s new King, is ’■he nm ting of the old kmg. &quot;And he laid hold on the diagon. that old serpent, -which is the Dml. and Satan, and hound him a thousand years ( Revelation 20: 2) This binding we may expect to take place during the final phase of the great time of trouble, for it must come before the restoration can take place, It is the restoration ot Edonic conditions, the birth of the now vrdti, toward which we are looking with such expectancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;We, according to his promise, look for new Kevin- and a new earth, wherein dv, el’eth righteousness.'' (2 Peter 3: 13*) The neu world, like the old, will he composed of a spiritual ruling power /heavens), and an orderly arrangement of society (earth). With Satan bound and hi« associates, the demons, scattered and possibly destroyed, the present spiritual ruling powers will be no more. The new King will have HA own heavens, a mighty organization composed of those who are faithful to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ti is believed by practically all Christians That the church, if faithful, is to receive exaltation to the divine nature. The Apostle Peter dr-rniclJy so states in 2 Peter 1:4. To prove that it is this same church which will be associated u Ji Jesus in the new heavens, let us consider the following- Allowing proimAs: &quot;He that &lt;&nbsp;vereometb, giveth.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Acts on Earth</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270406_files/g_E_19270406-17.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">

<p><span class="font6">AVTNG seen th( </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font6"> onpnnition of the imw hiavc</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">rm,</span><span class="font6"> let us consider the makeup of the new earth. The Aportk PeUr gives us much light on the subject. He prophesied the restoration, saying: Him (Jesus Christ) “the heavens must receive until the times of restitution [restoration] of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.<sup>-</sup>’ (Acts 3:21) The apostle then goes on to quote one of the prophets, the lawgiver. Hoses: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto nit ; him shall ye heartin all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.’<sup>-</sup>—Acts 3: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thi* &amp;t; Ament was spoken to the children of Israel, and indicates very clearly that this people is to hear the word* of the new King hist of ahi. It is for triii rwison that we see now the returning favor of God to the Jews, and their activity hi recognizing Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Notice the</span><span class="font6"> woids of Ezekiel: “Then he said unto me, Son of man, them bones and the whole house of Israel: behold thrv say. Our hono« are dried, and our hope is lost; we are cut off for our part. Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thu* saith the Lord God; Behold, 0 my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, and shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live; and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that 1 the Lord have spokmi it, and performed it, saith the Lord.”—Ezekiel 37:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prophecy will have a literal fulfilment in the resurrection. but the manifest real meaning of the v, ords quoted is that the bones represent the national hopes of Israel Long have they been huiied. Now they are revived, and Israel ri rewiiiiiig to Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When they have returned, then will be fulfilled the words of Jeremiah, “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that T made with the ir fall cis, in the day that I look them by the head, to bring them out of the land of Egypt: which my covenant they brake, . . . but this shall be the covenant that I will make . . » 1 wdl put iuv Jaw in them mvvard parts, and write it in th&lt; «r hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<sup>-</sup>’— Jeremiah 31: 31-33. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The leaders of the children of Israel at that time will be the awakened worthies of old, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets, many of whom are mentioned by the Apostle Paul in Hebrews the 11 th chapter. Isaiah also mentioned them when describing the new reign. He says, &quot;Behold, a J’irtg shall reign in righteous-nr--'-, and princes shall rme in yrlgawnt.”— Isr Ah 3'2:1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>J</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tbwe px’irces are .d-mfled foi us by the Pwilmisl er I by mir Lord : w The Psalmist fdeU&quot;-' • <sup>f</sup>‘ln&gt;toad n<sup>4</sup> 1 ’ v ■'‘W &gt;U h » Ay children, uhom tlmi eay-’-'t r ko princes in all the earih.” Tlnd m to s-w. fi e tat’mn-- in Israel ai e no longer I-' Ise- an win as the fathers, but as ones vbo Imv-&quot; ro.-fived life from the new K ,&lt; • &lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;I? &lt;■ &gt;&nbsp;? ..in wiio'i: .md tney will he made ]i me s /:'! th- c-artn.

<p><span class="font6">Addressing the Pharisees Jesus said: “What think ye of Christ.’ whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.” Then Jesus asked the question: &quot;How then doth David in spirit call him Lord? . . . If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?” (Matthew 22:42,43,45) Evidently David is to be no more father of the anointed King, but is to be subservient to Him. Furthermore, Jesus informed the religious rulers of His day. “There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.”—Luke 13: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Pharisees and other unfaithful religious rulers of Jesus’ day are certainly not to go to heaven; and if they are to see Abraham, Isaac </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font6">d Jacob and the prophets they must see them here on the earth. And they shall see them as princes, while they themselves shall have no place of authority at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only the Jews, however, are to be in the new earth. When the Bedeemer has come to Zion, then &quot;'the Gmitiles shall come to thy light, and king’s to the brightness of thy rising.”(Isaiah 60:3) And again, “Be still, and know that 1 am God; I will he exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.”—Psalm 46:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TVcw </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Code of L@ws</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">/\NE of the benefits of the new world will be ” its new code of laws. Today our statute books are overcrowded with laws, many of which cannot be enforced, and justice many times f</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ail a </span><span class="font6">of accomplishment. Laws are needed for those who do not desire to do righteously. When people in this new day which is now dawning, shall come to the Lord to inquire of Him, having a desire to do righteously, relatively few laws will be required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But His laws will be jiwt, and they will b- rm-forced fu Jie 1 Hter. &quot;He shall rule them with a rod of iron.” (Revelation 1 J: 15) This indicates the great firmness of the now Ring. a firmness v-’<sup>4</sup> we might fear k v -ic not rsonied ia adwme<sup>A</sup> that HA rule shall be absolutely jm-t. &quot;Judumenr also will I lav to the line, and righteousness to the plummet.”—Isaiah 28:1&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our present courts of justice have sometimes been criticized on the score that justice may be obtained bj the rich but not always by the poor, in spite of the fact that theoretically all stand equal before the law. Ip the new world no such criticism can be leveled. “Give the king thy judgments, 0 God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son. He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.”—Psalm 72:1,2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only will political and social equality be preached; it will actually be practised. &quot;The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.” (Isaiah 2:11) “For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; . . . but the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.”—Psalm 37: 9,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This brings us to the point of the new economic order. If there is any class today that does not inherit the earth, it is the meek. Today those who are aggressive and powerful are the ones who obtain. It will not always be so, however. With the power of the Almighty God hack of Him, the-new King will make a redistribution of things; and we shall see not only social and political equality, but economic equality as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In past ages there has not been enough to ao around. The world has been poor. Additionally much of the substance of the earth has been wasted in the riotous living of a few, in disastrous wars, and through an inefficient industrial system. In the new world, however, a complete change will be brought about. Plenty will tm®-vail, and therefore, there -will be enough to divide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The wilderness, and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.” (Isaiah 35:1) “They shall build houses, and inhabit them: and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat/-Isa. 65: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this is promised, and much more, too. It is not held forth as the ^«ult of the efforts to be made m mankind. This condition of aFai’’« will not come because man wills it.

And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will he your God.” (Ezekiel 36: 26-28) This was spoken primarily to the Jews; but it has a secondary application to all, because Jehovah will be King in all the earth in that day, and all «hall be His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the I owl.

<p><span class="font6">“The eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall bo unstopped.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Now mark this point well: These conditions described are to obtain in the resurrection, and may be enjoyed by Jews and Gentiles alike. The first statement I quoted in this connection •was John 11:26. Now lot me read the context: “Jesus said unto her, I ?in the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die/’-John 11:25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is possible because all will be awakened from the sleep of death, but only those who </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">believe</span><span class="font6"> after being awakened will receive a full resurrection. The word “resurrection” means “restanding to life”. Only those who believe and accept the new King will receive a complete restanding to life such as Adam had in the garden of Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All shall come back from the tomb, however. 'Jesus said so, and Jehovah has added His promise. Remember, God has promised to forgive the iniquities of the Jews. In Ezekiel 16:48, 51 He declared: “As I live, saith the Lord God, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters,... aeither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That being the ease, one would expect that God would forgive these nations also, and bring them back; and that is exactly what God will do when He restores Israel. “IVhen thy sister, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.”—Ezekiel 16: 55.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we recall that Sodom was utterly destroyed by fire from God out of heaven, we can see that this restoration can be possible only by a resurrection. It will occur right here on the earth, for it is “'to their former estate”. “Then thou shall remember thy ways and bo ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will. aiv&lt;- them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.” (V. 61) Yes, these nations will be saved also, but rot by the old Law Covenant of the Jews: no, but by the New Covenant of that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As stated in the very beginning, hi order to bring a complete reversal of the world there must be a threefold change. Now we have how the Bible shows that there is being made this very change. The new world is now beginning, and the old is passing away. The new world is composed of the new heavens and the new earth—that is to say, the new spiritual ruling organization under the kingship of Jesus, and the new order of society, the nations at jieace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new civilization is based upon a new principle, the principle of love—love for God and for mankind. It will be a world of prosperity and plenty and equality. God Himself shall bring it into existence. lie has promised a New Covenant and life to all those who shall hear. “And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that. Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.”—Acts 3:23. every one who saith unto me. Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the-will of my Father which is m heaven. V\ e see therefore that it would be entirely impossible for children, the heathen, and all who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font6">not study the Bible to enter into heaven; 'became before one can do the will of God he must have knowledge of what that will is; and God's will is expressed in the Bible. These individuals who now do God's holy will have part in the heavenly calling, according to Hebrews 3:1. Their reward is in heaven. They vid be jointheirs with Christ Jesus as powerful spirit being?, in order that they might he the chief agents of the heavenly Father in His service throughout eterjiity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">But what will be the- calling of the rest of mankind ? The rest of mankind, most of whom v ill eonm forth in the resurrection, will be called to everlasting life on earth, as subjects of Christ and His church: and as earthly beings they also will serve and honor Jehovah. Earthly life will soon be offered to all the dead infants and heathen, and all those who are without the knowledge of the truth.

In Hebrews 6:4 we read, “It is impossible for those who weie once eid’ghtened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were partakers of the heavenly spirit, and have ta'-ted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come [that is, if their minds have been enlightened concerning the kingdom or new eider], if they shall fall away, to icnew them again, unto repentance; seeing they crucifv to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But some will ask, If that is the ease, would it not be unwise to consecrate and come to a knowledge of the truJH Not so. Of course, if an individual recognizes what is the truth, and is convicted of the Seri]stores in his own mind, he is responsible; and if he neglects to do God's will, he places bimst If subject to extermination by resisting piogiess in the truth. But lot uS remember that all who will ever obtain fife everlasting must detcjmine to do God’s holy will and do it. After a ceitain period of testing, if faithful by the grace of God, such an one will be given everlasting life. Tn Romans 6:23 we read, “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Chri-J our Lord.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : Were the Magi representatives of God or agents of the Devil?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: The Magi or wise men mentioned in Matthew the second chapter were the agents of the Devil. The reasons for this are very plain from the Scripture account. These wise men were undoubtedly astrologers and acquainted with the occult sciences of the East, which are clearly from the Devil. They were led by the star, first to Herbd, rvho was under the influence of Satan and sought the destruction of Jesus. Certainly God would not wish to give any information to the Devil’s agent who was bent upon the destruction of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bright light, called a star, was formed by the Devil also. It is a fact that occultists are enabled to see bright lights in the sky, rvhich may not appear visible to other people. This star then led from diieetly to the place where Jesus was born. Herod previously instructed <sup>1</sup> hem to convey the news to him as to where they found the Child. His purpose was to destroy the Child, regardless of the fact that he had said that he would worship Him. These Magi may have acted unwittingly, as dupes of the Devil, to be parties in the conspiracy for the destruction of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: Was the fruit of the tree of knowledge poisonous which Adam ate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: The fruit may have been very wholesome. It was a part of the creative process and therefore very good. Adam's oh'^lience was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">pul </span><span class="font6">to the test. It would make no difference as to the quality of the fruit. Adam did that which lie w as told not to do, and this constituted the sin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Eleventh Study)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">62. Adam had lots of other creatures to keep him company in the garden, but he was the only human Aeing there. Naturally he wanted somebody to tall? to and to live with, for he got very tired of living alone. God saw this, and when Adam was asleep He created mother Eve. She was the most beautiful lady who ever lived, because she was perfect. She and Adapt v ere very happy together 101 a long time, and loved each other very much.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God's Law</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">63. God gave a command to Adam, telling him what he might do and what he might not do; and if Adam had obeyed this law he would be alive to this day. It was not a. hard law to obey. GA nd the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: For in the day that thou eatest thereof </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">thou shalt surely</span><span class="font6"> die.&quot;—Genesis 2:16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">64. Thus we see that God told Adam that if he ate of the fruit of this certain tree, He would take away the wonderful gift of life from him and that Adam would die—death would be his punishment for disobeying the great Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">65. Now Lucifer, who was also the Devil and Satan, was looking for a chance to get control of Adam and Eve. Therefore when he learned of the command which God had given them he thought that if they could be made to disobey God he would have them in his power.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Biggest Lie Ever Told</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">66. Satan was very clever. He knew that the fear of death kept Adam and Eve from eating the forbidden fruit. Therefore he came to Eve and told her that God -was trying to take advantage of her and Adam, to keep them from knowing as much as God Himself. This was the first lie. God's only purpose in laying the command on Adam was for Adam’s good, and to test his loyalty. But Satan told Eve that if she and Adam ate the fruit, nothing would happen. &quot;Ye shall not surely die,” said he. That was the second lie, and the biggest one that has ever been told.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Happened to Adam</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">67. After disobeying God by eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve lost the right to live any longer. God hail told them mat if they ate of the fruit they woukl die. But the Devil had come along and said that they would </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font6">die. Mother Eve had very foolishly listened to the Devil instead of to God and Adamm had listened to ino’Ler Evo; and thus our fim parents made a great mistake. Let us see huw Jehovah God punished them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">68. They did not deserve to live in the beautiful garden which God had made for them, so H.e caused an angel to chase them out and bar the gate so that they could never come back. They went, out into the rough, stony plains and deserts, and Adam had to work hard to grow vegetables and fruit to eat.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">69. In the garden of Eden Adam had onlv tn reach up and pick any fruit that he wanted. All kinds were always growing there—big, ripe and juicy. But God said, in turning Adam and Eve out of the garden: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,” meaning that Adam would have to work very hard to get anything </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to eat </span><span class="font6">from the desert.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Questions on Eleventh Study</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">66, How many lies did he tell to mother Eve? WhiGi of those lies is the biggest one that was ever told?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">67. When Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit, what did they lose? Does it pay to hark to any who is disobedient to God? Why not?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">68. Did Adam and Ere de-erve to live in the beautiful garden after they had sinned? Did they get shut out, and how ? Where did they go?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">69. Was it hard or easy to get a living in the garden of Eden ? Was it hard or easy to get a living outside of it? Why?</span></p>
