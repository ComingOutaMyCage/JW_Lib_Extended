<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Day of God at Toronto</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">LL who are familiar with. God’s Word know ■ that His method is to begin quietly, to begin darkly, to apparently suffer defeat, and yet in the end to win a glorious unmatchable triumph. “The evening and the morning were the first day,” and that has been true of every one of His days. A dark beginning, a triumphant ending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. _</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All can see Low true this principle is in its application to the seventh day of earth’s creation. It began with the fall of humanity into sin and death. It ends with the complete recovery of humanity, their lifting up to perfection and everlasting life, as many as will. A dark beginning, a bright and glorious ending. How like our God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So steadfast is this principle that God caused it to be pictured in cveiy day of the lives of His typical people. Israel. The new day began the instant that the sun sank below the western horizon. For some hours it grew darker; but the imw day was on the way. and eventually it came, and ended in a blaze of glory filling the whole hoavem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The International Bible Students have been holding a convention in Toronto, Canada. The date was July 18th-25th, 1927. It was the most glorious, the most awe-inspiring, of all Bible Students conventions since that day in the upper room at Jerusalem when the holy spirit was poured out upon the Availing conventioncrs; and, I'lm that first one, it all centered about an act of God, an act that had a dark beginning, but the most wonderful ending imaginable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have to pass by the convention itself, for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">time, while we consider that act. It had its beginning months before, yes, even years before, when well-meaning but inexperienced engineers undertook to perform work which they were not competent to handle, and thus delayed the installation and operation of WBBR just at a time</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">when every moment counted. The Lord’s hand may now be seen in what was at that time a considerable trial to Judge Rutherford and his friends, who -were anxious that the message of the truth should go out over the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eventually the best of equipment was installed, but not before the wave length originally allocated by the Department of Commerce had become jeopardized, and when the station opened it was obliged to use a lesser wave and then for a time was assigned to 416.4 meter wave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dark day began back there in the days of preliminary equipment; it grew darker when </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">Radio Commission was delegated which its critics claim is composed in part at least of men who ought not to be serving on the Commission because of business connections; and it grew darker still when notice was served on WBBR that it must reduce its wave length from 416.4 to 256.3 meters.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The Hearing at Washington</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE darkest hour of the day might be said to have come when Judge Rutherford and some of his colleagues, Major J. P. Holmes of San Antonio, Lieutenant Eugene D. Orrell of Wilmington, N. C., Captain G. Y. McCormick of Hollis, L. I., and a staff of radio experts and secretaries went to Washington to present their just claims to a higher wave length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What happened at that hearing makes a thrilling story in itself, and we hope in due time to get it at some length for use in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> but at this writing all who were there are too busily engaged with other important matters to provide the materials for the story, and w® have room at this time for only a condensed statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Realizing that a giant corporation, the National Broadcasting Company, practically eon-m</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">trolled the air for broadcasting purposes, and that it had been for four years sending out the programs of the Federal Council of Churches, and that the Radio Commission was sure to be biased toward both of these institutions and therefore indifferent or unfriendly to the work in which the Bible Students are engaged, Judge Rutherford warned his -colleagues that they should merely undertake to he the Lord's witnesses and to leave the result with Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Accordingly, Judge Rutherford pointed out these facts to the Commission laid before them fifteen thousand letters and affidavits irom some of the best citizens of the land, including men high in every reputable walk of life, who testified that WBBR furnishes the be.d, most uplifting programs of any station now on the air, notified them that the radio waves aie the property of Jehovah God and not, and <sub>no</sub>t merely of the United States Navy or the National Broadcasting Company, and warned them not to interfere with the divine purpose to use the radio at this time in broadcasting the truth, as God would require it at their hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An interesting incident of the hearing was when Judge Rutherford drew from one &quot;Doctor” who w’as at the hearing, in the interests of the Federal Council of Churches, that he had no right to the title, did not know which of the 603 ministers that have preached over the radio network were modernists and which were fundamentalists, and could not of his own knowledge testify that he ever heard one of them attempt to give an exposition of the Bible as to what it teaches concerning the creation, the fall, the redemption and the restoration of man. Although it was self-evident that the ministers were vitally interested in this hearing, this Doctor, who is really a layman, was their only representative at Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Hlutkerford’s Closing Argument</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270907_files/g_E_19270907-3.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">From his twenty-page argument in summing up before the Commission we present a few paragraphs which we know will be of great interest to our readers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“When WBBR began to operate we were tenth in the list of those licenses. Today, after being on the air for three and one-half years, we are twenty-fifth in the list of those allocated wave lengths of advantage. I want to call attention here to this, which is of far more public interest than merely one case that is being heard by the Commission. There has been a growing tendency in this country for a long while to concentrate all the power in the hands of a few I am not alone in that thought by any means; many public men have so stated, and all of us know that that is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Special intends have been diligent in having laws enacted for their special and selfish benefit in this land. They have not always succeeded in this, however. The difficulty is not so often with the law hut in the interpretation and aaimnjslering ol that law. For some time there has been a concentration of money power in this land to control even business and every public interest. The predatory wealth controls the banks, the public press and the transportation systems: and now it is reaching its octopus arms out to control the air. It says to the people in effect: BVe will take the air and do with it what we ploa-e. We will make all the money out of it we can and then give you what we do not want.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Above all, the air belongs to Jehovah God, and the use of it by the radio also belongs to Him. Ho has provided it for the people that they might know His name and plan. He has brought it to light just at this time for the purpose of having the message of His kingdom told to the people. He will have it done regardless of any opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The invisible power which has influenced, controlled and oppressed the nations and peoples of earth for centuries is Satan the Devil, your enemy and mine. There is no reason why men should fight about their interests. We are all human beings. We all spring from one common source. We are all made of one common blood. There is no reason ‘why men should fight. But our enemy the Devil, who is the opponent of God and the opponent of righteousness, has injected into the minds of men that which causes them to fight each other; and the time has come for the people to know the truth. He is the enemy of God and the enemy of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The people generally are ignorant of this fact. That ignorance is due, to some degree at least, to the selfishness of men who desire the plaudits of men and not the approval of God; and the most responsible man today for this and for the ignorance of the American people is the clergyman. Not on® of them would get upon this platform. I would like to have examined one of them today before this Commission to prove that ninety percent of the clergymen who stand before the people and pretend to preach the Bible do not believe a word of it. They are destroying the faith of the young men and the old men, and driving the whole nation into infidelity. And that is my only reason for wanting to get this message to the people. I am not trying to get joiners or to get money. It is purely educational and to get the people back to that which they had when this nation was first established.'’</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">RESIDENT Meilin Hall Aylesworth, of the National Broadcasting Company (the son of a minister, by the va\) was personally interested and concerned in this remarkable case. The follov ing colloquy, while President Aylesworth was on the stand and Judge Rutherford was questioning him, led to an unmistakable revelation of the hand of God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. We try to supply everything in the amount of time available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q. In the time available!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. Yes, sir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q. But you select the things you supply?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. Yes, sir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q. And you do select what yon think will supply the public demand of the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. We hope so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q. Now, if you were convinced that the great Creator of the Universe, Jehovah God, had a message to deliver to the people of America, you would be just as anxious to deliver that message? , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. Yes; just as I do want to let the people get yours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q. Then I will ask you direct, Is it possible to arrange an hour in the very near future?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. Any time you want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q. Then I ask you to make it definite for July 24th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. So far as I know that is fine. I haven’t a program with me. How about, that, Mr. McClelland?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Mr. Me Clelland: I think that is all right</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Witness: However, we will try to arrange it for that time, even if we have a program on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By Judge Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q. We will try that. I have an engagement to deliver a message at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. I am glad to do it. I am very serious about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q. Very fine. Would you indicate at this time what would be the cost to our association!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A. There will be no cost to you, sir.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Hand of the Devil also Shown</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">E GIVE the above word-for-word report of the colloquy between President Aylesworth and Judge Rutherford, as taken from the ofiicial report of the hearing, made on the spot by the firm of Hart, Dice and Carlson, shorthand reporters, 41fi Fifth St., N. W., Washington, D. C., so that all honest persons may compare it with the report as given in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Woild</span><span class="font7"> of Wednesday, July 20th, and widely telegraphed all over the country. This will help some simple-minded but honest souls to see the real value of the press in this year of our Lord 1927:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“An angry dare and its hasty acceptance at a hearing before the Federal Radio Commission a month ago has resulted in supplanting the regular Sunday afternoon interdenominational service of The Greater New York Federation of Churches, which was to be broadcast from WEAF next Sunday, with an address by Joseph F. Rutherford, long anathema to conservative clergymen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(Then follows a two-paragraph squawk on behalf of the church federation and four more paragraphs of drivel about the work of Judge Rutherford, and then the following:)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I dare you to let me speak from your station,” shouted Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“You may speak, sir, for one hour on any day and at any hour you may select,” responded Aylesworth angrily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“AU right,” said Rutherford quickly, “1 choose 3 P. M. Sunday, July 24th, next.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“That will be arranged,” said Aylesworth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(Then another one-paragraph squawk about the Federation of Churches and the following:)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Recently Mr. Aylesworth learned that Mr. Rutherford, forgetting or intending to decline the opportunity furnished him, had agreed to attend the convention of the association of which he is president in Toronto, Canada. It became Mr. Aylesworth’s turn to show the evangelist his bluff could not be called.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(Then another paragraph which admitted that file projected hook-up would be the biggest in. radio history, with a lie taeked on to it reading *with the exception only of a few events of national interest and importance”, and a con-dudtog squawk on behalf of the orthodox churches.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took the NewYork </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font7"> a full month to garble the interesting news from Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">get it into its columns in such a form that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font7">a person who was at the hearing could recognize it in any manner whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newspapers in general came to the assistance of their ignoble alliexS, among them the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> also the Toronto newspapers. The latter had already decided not to give the Bible Students a line of publicity of any nature except for the outrageous price of 41V P<sup>er</sup> b<sup>fie</sup>-Therefore the Bible Students issued their own newspapers, a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Souvenir of the Convention</span><span class="font7"> and fcur issues of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font7"> and were as independent of the Toronto papers as if the latter had been published in Timbuetoo.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>A Foregleam of the Coming Victory</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font7">ROM the issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> for Friday, July 22nd, we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Never before in the history of the human family has any one man talked to as many people as Judge Rutherford will address this coming Sunday afternoon in the Coliseum. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The National Broadcasting Company has taade an unparalleled hook-up covering every important station from Alai ne to California, and from the Arctic Circle to the Caribbean Sea. The lecture will be rebroadcast in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For a week past the newspapers of the voild have been groping for news. Their columns have been as barren of food for the mind as if issued by the bushmen of Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Here is news of the first magnitude. This hook-up, from the viewpoint of the Bibto, and from the scientific point of view, is the only real news in the world at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But the papers are as de ad fs the mummy of Rameses IV, embalmed in &quot;Egypt four thousand years ago. Tutankhamen m then editor and Pharaoh Nocho their pressman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Whence all this silence in the newspaper offices? is it because they do not know? It is not. They know it all too well. That is why they are sad and why we laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“They want it understood that they stand by the preachers. They do indeed. They stand by them and cease not their wailing, the while aft men hold their noses. “</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“They know not that the common people are aware that the preachers, as such, have ceased to exist They know not that hypocrisy is now a laughingstock and ecclesiasticism gathers green mold,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They smell not; else it would be apparent to them that the reign of the clergy hath ended in these many years back. and quick interment in this hot weather is much in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They hear not; else they would hear the undertaker rumbling toward them with the dead wagon' and the eager footsteps of all humanity I longing to be the pall-bearers of the fraud. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“They</span><span class="font7"> feel not; else they would feel the clammy hand which is clutched in theirs, and the cold sweat which slowly exudes from the body of what was once hailotry enthroned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They see not; else they would know that when the face is black and pennies from the collection box hold down the eyelids there is nothing left but the funeral oration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Why do the Bible Students laugh in this hour of newspaper sadness? It is because they see the Devil caught with the goods: Hypocrisy, deception, fraud, meanness, littleness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“When they see the adjoining column from the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> it will be with difficulty that some of them will keep from rolling on the ground. Unalloyed joy will be theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'The roar of laughter at the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition will sound like the waters fall nig over Niagara. The Bible Students see what has happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It was a brilliant idea u hen the Devil adopted the clergy as his children, and another brilliant one when ho took over the press to boost thorn and pat them on the back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It It was a brilliant idea vbwn he got the clergy to father and mother his own lie that nobody ever dies and that his kingdom is Christ's kingdom. Brilliant once. Not now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But when the Lord brought forth the truth about His plan and His kingdom, and when He brought forth His radio to enter within all walls, it was a bad day for all highwaymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The accompanying </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> article tells us sadly that for four years the preachers have been using the National Broadcasting Circuit, and that nobody is interested. Everybody yawns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> goes on to tell ns that Judge Rutherford laid the hypocrisy of the preachers _ wide open at the hearing in Washington and that now, in all sadness, they admit they knew it. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;All the reporters in Washington were at that hearing and knew the great facts and laid them before their papers, but Tutankhamen still held the dead hand of Raineses II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Did the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> render a public service by immediately coming out in the open and letting the people know of that great event in Washing-' ton ? Not so that you could notice it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;But because they know that Judge Rutherford had given the funeral oration over ee-clesiastieism they tried to kid themselves into thinking the corpse was still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;In the past the preachers have done all the dirty work for big business and for crooked politicians, but their work is done. The gravediggers are throwing out the last gravel even now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;'And then the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> does a wonderful thing. It did not mean to do it. It could not help it. It gave all its powers to advertising Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Previously, when he spoke in New York to a great concourse of people at the New Madison Square Garden, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font7"> at the behest of the preachers, gave him not a line of publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Judge Rutherford was willing to pay for advertising ; but they would not accept his money, because the preachers did not want the meeting advertised. But it was, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The Bible Students got on the job and in two days put a million and a quarter dodgers out in New York City, telling the people all about it. And the people laughed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And now the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> comes out and tells us that the preachers are dead; that Judge Rutherford has taken their place, and invites everybody to listen in. And they will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Let us admit that the newspapers are no longer necessary. Every great newspaper strike has shown that. London showed it. New York showed it. Chicago showed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But as a last gasp the squawk from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font7">is a good thing. It does tell the day and the hour when the people can hear Judge Rutherford. And all are glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“All are glad. Yes, all the people. The preachers, the press and the politicians have done their dirty work and are about all done. The Lord is now on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And on Sunday afternoon Judge Rutherford will tell all about it He will make it all dear why the papers of Toronto have kept still about the only news they had.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Victory Itself, Goifs Victory</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HOUGH the National Broadcasting Company was the instrument, Jehovah God Himself and His great General, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, alone are entitled to the credit for the victory which followed. In the first place it rained very hard all day Saturday, the day before the great message was to be given. This cleared all the static out of the air, and the Judge’s voice was as clear to approximately twenty-five million people as if he had been in the same room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Broadcasting Company preceded and followed the lecture by an excellent musical program sent out from New York City. The dean of announcers, Graham Me Naniee, came on from New York to heral I the great event; and after a brief introduction by Robert J. Martin, editor in chief of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font7"> the Judge began his masterly and courageous address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interrupted from time to time by applause from the vast throng (11.000 people) which overcrowded the Coliseum, he begged them to remain silent while he talked to the far greater audience which was unseen, the greatest audience ever addressed by man. We cover this point by quoting again from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger),</span><span class="font7"> of Monday, July 25th, the closing day of the convention. Under the title &quot;Judge Rutherford Addressing the Whole World. The First Time in History That Any Lecturer Has Ever Talked to All Parts of the Earth”, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“One of the greatest events of the age lias passed into history. Judge Rutherford's address, at Toronto, marked the end of the old way and the coming m of the nev.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Ten year?, ago the Bible Students anticipated that by the end of 1925 the gospel would be -broadcast from some one station to all the rest of the world. They did not miss it by very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Ten weeks ago there were no signs that Judge Rutherford would have the whole world listening to him from the Coliseum platform, on July, 24th. But events move rapidly now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Nothing could more plainly demonstrate the hand of God than the wonderful way in which this seemingly impossible thing was brought about. All things are easy for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is less than six weeks ago that Judge 'Rutherford and his colleagues were at Vmsh, ington, setting forth to the Radio Comrus a m their just rights to a. high wave length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Reasons were given why WBBR. Judge Rutherford’s station on Sloan Island, sn mid have part of tl e time of WJZ. Tt Sro-E? ■&gt; ] yi.p ,, hopeless among men, but God moved other men</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">&quot;'So it came about that when Judge Rutherford stepped out on the platform yesterday he stepped out to speak from all the stations which go to make up the National Broadcasting circuit, in addition to his ovn chain of stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“These include many of the most important station.*- in the United States, and with them the lied, Blue, and Pacific networks, as they are called, leaching eBar across the continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But he spoke from more than these, because many otiier of the most prominent broadcasting studios, including several in Canada, concluded also to send out the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“So it came to pass that Judge Rutherford, standing in Toi onto, talked ft™ a line of stations reaching irom Toronto, through Saskatoon and Edmonton to Vancouver on the Pacific coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Standing in Toronto he was broadcasting simultaneously from Boston, 'Worcester, Springfield, Hartford. Providence, and other stations all. over New England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Standing in Toronto his voice went out from the greatest studios in New York, Schenectady, Buffalo, Rochester, Washington, Pittsburgh and other stations in the Middle Atlantic states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Though here in Canada, he broadcast from Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago, Minneapolis, Davenport, Batavia, Louisville, and many other stations in the Middle 'Western states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Without leaving the Coliseum his voice rang out from stations in Charlotte, Memphis, Nashville, Jacksonville, Dallas, and from stations in many other cities all over the Southern states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Though his voice went into but one microphone here yer it entered other microphones with oq<sub>U</sub>al power in Des Mories, Omaha, Denver, San Antonio, Oakland and Spokane.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“As the Toronto meetmg broke up, 595 workers, stationed at vantage points within the Coliseum and Transportation Buildings (where loud speakers were installed), offered dollar combinations to thousands who wished to join the thirty million readers of tl e Judge’s great books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In our mind’s eye we roe that scene dupli* cated a thousandfold. The great work of popularizing the truth has really begun. Can it ba that the Millennial Morning is here?’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It should be added that when the Judge had ceased speaking the entire audience arose to their feet and with an “Aye” that was heard around the world adopted the resolution which follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We now give the resolution and the address in full:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The speaker said: Mr. Chairman, my audience seen and unseen: What I shall say here is in the interest of the common peoples of earth, and especially in behalf of those of Christendom. First, I offer the following resolution and then I shall speak in support of that resolution. The resolution reads as follows:</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark17"></a>RESOLUTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">[Judge Rutherford’s address in support of this Resolution will be found In full on pages 783-791.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To the Peoples of Christendom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The International Bible Students in general convention assembled send greetings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Christians and witnesses to the name of Jehovah God we deem it our privilege and duty to ea 11 your attention to the following vital facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FIRST. That God macle of one blood all peoples and nations of mon to dwell on the earth, and granted to all peoples equal rights. There is therefore no just cause or excuse for one nation to make war against another nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SECOND That the foremost nation* of the earth claim to he f'Dristiaii nations and, taken collectively, rix-y constitute &quot;'''Christendom” or “organized Christianity”, so-called; that the men chiefly responsible for the claim that these aie Christian nations are the clergymen of the various denominations, who call themselves by the name of Christ but w ho in fact have denied him; that iheir purpose of claiming that these nations are Christian is to induce the peoples to believe that said Rations, although military and cruel, are the representatives of God and his Christ on earih; that sucii claim is fraudulent and false and has turned the minds of millions of honest people away from the true God and from Ids Christ; that the invisible ruler of th© nations of &quot;Christendom” or &quot;organized Christianity”, so-called, is Satan the Devil, who has fathered the scheme of forming &quot;organized Christianity” to deceive the people and to keep them in subjection to himself and his agencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the masses of the peoples of the nations are entitled to self-government exercised by the people for the general welfare of all; but instead of enjoying such rights a small minority rules: that the money power of the world has been coneenti ated into the hands of a few men called high financiers, and these in turn have corrupted the men who make and execute the laws of the nations, and the faithless clergy have voluntarily joined forces with the high financiers and professional politicians, and that said unholy alliance constitutes the governing powers that rule the peoples; that the masses of the peoples acting under a misapprehension of the true facts have borne up, carried, supported and maintained organized Christianity; and that without the support of the common people the Unholy alliance constituting organized Christianity could not long exist</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THIRD. That for centuries the privileges enjoyed by men have been wholly unequal and unfair, The multitudes have produced the wealth of the world, but have been unjustly deprived of the fruits of Their labors. That the leaders of Christendom instead of teaching the children of men the doctrines of Christ, whom they claim to folloTv, teach them to murder their fellow’ creatures; and that now the rulers are amalgamating the common people with the military, in order to make all the peoples a part of and subject to their great vac machine; that by unjust laws the common peopl-y military to tlieix' own wishes, have been compelled to go to war against each other, resulting in great sorrow and suffering, multitudes of broken hearts and millions of untimely graves; that “organized Christianity” has turned a deaf ear to the petitions and entreaties of the people for relief, and now Cie cries of the oppressed people have entered into the oars of Jehovah God, and his time is at hand to give the peoples deliverance and freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FOURTH. That Jehovah is the only true God, the friend and benefactor of the peoples. He has now set his beloved Son Christ Jesus upon his throne, and bids all the peoples of earth to hear and to obey him who is earth’s rightful King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FIFTH. That the kings and rulers of the earth, to wit those constituting the said unholy alliance have been duly notified that God has set his King upon his throne and that his kingdom is at hand; but they refuse to understand or to take heed, and they walk on in darkness. Therefore God has demoed and decreed that there shall come upon the world a time of trouble such as such as never was known; and that during that trouble “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”, so-called, and all of Satan’s organization shall be destroyed; and that Christ Jesus, the righteous King, will assume complete authority and control and will bless the peoples of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SIXTH. That it must be now apparent to all thoughtful peoples that relief, comfort and blessings so much desired by them can never come from the unrighteous system of “Christendom” or &quot;organized Christianity”, and that there is no reason to give further support to that hypocritical and oppressive system. In this hour of perplexity Jehovah God bids the peoples to abandon and for ever forsake “Christendom” or “organ*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">issed Christianity’*, and to turn completely away from it, because it is the Devil's organization, and to give it no support whatsoever; and that the peoples give their heart’s devotion and allegiance wholly to Jehovah God and to his King and kingdom, and receive full freedom and the blessings God has in store for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SEVENTH. For four thousand years the cherished desire of Jews has been God’s Messianic kingdom. For nineteen centuries that kingdom has been the hope of real Christians. It is now at hand. True to his promise God by and through the reign of Christ will lift the burdens of the peoples, free them from war, fraud and oppression, from sickness, suffering and death, and give to them a righteous government and the blessings of everlasting peace, prosperity, life, and happiness. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford's address in support of the resolution will be found on pages 783-791.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The many new readers of this number will be interested to know that each issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> carries one of Judge Rutherford’s lectures broadcast from one of the stations used by the International Bible Students Association. Subscribers to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> will therefore be assured of keeping up with these lectures.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>A Few More Convention Items</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">OpHE total attendance of Bible students at J- Toronto is variously estimated at 11,000 to 14,000. The Coliseum seated 8,500 and was comfortably full at every session. When Judge Rutherford spoke, it was crowded and on the occasion of his Sunday afternoon address was packed, with an overflow meeting of 2,000, served by loud speakers installed in the Transportation Building for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The program was an interesting one. Able Speakers came from all parts of the world. The Convention was officially opened with an address of welcome by Thomas Foster, mayor of Toronto, and a response from Judge Rutherford. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Souvenir</span><span class="font7"> published letters of welcome from the Premier of Ontario, G. Howard Ferguson, the president of the Rotary Club, and other public officials; and the Toronto people opened their homes to the Bible Students in the' most hospitable way. The work of arranging the details of the convention fell largely upon the manager of the Canadian office, Walter F. Salter, and his assistants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition, where the convention was held, are ideally situated on the shore of Lake Ontario. They comprise three hundred acres and buildings worth twelve million dollars. These buildings and grounds were free of all charge to the con-ventioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Souvenir,</span><span class="font7"> printed in the Canadian office from type set by Douglass Brothers, contained the official announcement of Judge Rutherford’s great lecture, and was sold to the extent of over 100,000, which is a circulation probably much more than that of any newspaper in Toronto; so there was no lack of local publicity. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Souvenir</span><span class="font7"> contained many nice things about Toronto, the people, the homes, the officials, the grounds, the various plants of the I. B. S. A., and sketches about the Judge’s books, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font7"> together with one of his addresses, and was sold on service, days for five cents per copy. It was very freely illustrated, and was on sale on the grounds the day the convention opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> was published on Tuesday, July 19th. It opened with a Greeting to the Conventioners from Judge Rutherford, and a sketch of his life by one the editors, pictures and sketches of a dozen or more of the Judge’s associates, including J. Ilemery, British Branch Manager, Paul Bal-zereit, Manager of Branch in Germany, and George Young, Ambassador at Large, and snatches of some of the best things said by Monday’s lecturers. It also contained a page of pictures of the station Watchtower WBBR, located on Staten Island.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Glances at the Messenger</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font7">LANCES at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> show that the issue of Wednesday, July 20th, contained Mayor Foster’s welcome and Judge Rutherford’s response, interesting items about the work in Spain and on the Gold Coast of West Africa, an interesting sketch of two women who started for the convention without funds but who covered more than 700 miles in five days, and an interview with Australians vdio came half around the world to attend. There were the usual excerpts from addresses by the speakers of the day before, with another full report of one of Judge Rutherford’s lectures over the radio. This issue contained pictures of the I. B. S. A. radio stations at Toronto, Edmonton, Chicago, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Oakland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Friday’s issue we have already quoted from liberally. It had a write-up of the convention’s arrangements for feeding the natural man, a dog-biscuit story that is worth reading, pictures of several groups of Bible Students, and a page specially devoted to the colporteurs, God bless them! The radio dramalogue, The Return of Little Betty Brown, was a feature of this issue which was much appreciated. The Judge’s keynote address to the conventioners themselves was in this issue. It will reappear in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The closing issue-of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> contained a picture of Judge Rutherford delivering the message that was heard around the world, extracts from a number of excellent discourses, two whole pages containing a general picture of the bulk of the conventioners, nieest-looking people you ever saw, with another page of pictures of the foreign-speaking delegates, Poles, Hungarians, Lithuanians and Slovaks, in session at the same time at Detroit. There was another dramalogue, and a parting message to the conventioners from the president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt most of our readers have these papers. Those that do not have them are out of luck because the papers are out of print, the entire issue having been oversold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The service work at the Toronto convention was well-prganized, most of the territory one hundred and fifty miles in diameter, with Toronto as a center, being well combed during the two days, Thursday and Saturday, devoted to that feature of the work. The 3,655 workers reported more than 30,000 books sold. All workers purchased for resale a total of 90,347 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reports from every part of the American continent show that Judge Rutherford’s wonderful address came in clear as a bell, as plainly heard in San Francisco and Dallas as in Chicago and New York. In scores of cities loud speakers were installed in parks, auditoriums and other public places where thousands of people could hear distinctly every word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In the past ten years there have been remarkable changes in both the mental and physical life of 'men and women.

<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Bishops of Lombardy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE Montreal </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font7"> contains a dispatch from Rome which says in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The radio came under the laJi of a pastoral letter drawn up by the Bishops of Lombirdy under the presidency of Cardinal Tosi, of M’lan. The lotier condemned the radio as a luxury “bad for the name of those uho ought to set a good example for others and a sign of worldly eiiriosny that is unbecoming and dangerous”. It was declared that priests mu4 not frequent bathing resorts vifhont special permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Anybody who has ever seen a hunch of fat, greasy, wine-soaked priests, with their sensual faces, can imagine how hilariously “the Bishops of Lombardy” must have laughed after they got logc-thoi the above bit of propaganda and launched it forth to their time-honored servants, the Press, to hand out to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The joke is not all in flic last sentence, though Protestant police and newspaper men would agree that it is joke enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The B’shops of Lombardy are worried over the radio, and the first reason they give is a peach. To own and operate a receiving set which will bring in any wholesome information to the mind is &quot;a sign of worldly curiosity It is indeed. The poor victim might learn something and cease to cough up so much per, to keep a lot of lazy loaiers riding him from the cradle to the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the Bishops of Lombardy get down to the real thing when they say that to own and operate a receiving set is dangerous. When they Said that they said something, and they know it, and we know it, and everybody is going to know it. The radio is the most dangerous thing to horse-collar hypocrisy that was ever invented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the radio keeps on telling the truth, the first thing you know some of these Bishops of Lombardy will be backed into the thills, collar and all, harnessed up in an expensive two-piece or one-piece suit of overalls, and put to work digging ditches; and if they do not dig until their hands are blistered, they will be fed on sawdust and shavings until they reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dangerous I We should say yes. Let us glance at some recent news items that have been broadcast over the radio and see if for once the Bishops of Lombardy did not tell the absolute truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was dangerous to the Bishops of Lombardy to have it broadcast that Roman Catholic police broke up a Protestant parade in New York City on orders from Patrick F. Scanlon, editor of the Roman Catholic </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tablet,</span><span class="font7"> and then to have the suggestion softly put forth that as soon as a change of administration comes there will he nothing to hinder Protestant police from breaking up Roman Catholic parades. And because it continues to stand only by overaweing a lot of poor mutts by its outward show, its parades, its bluff, there is nothing the bishops more fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy could well be scared to have it broadcast that after Lindbergh and Chamberlin had flown unblessed plar.es from New York to the heart of Europe, .De Pinedo’s plane, blessed by the Pope himself on Easter Sunday, flopped into the sea two or three hundred miles off his course and the poor fellow had to be tovred to the Azores. Once let the people get the right idea that a papal or priestly blessing is a curse, and they will stop wanting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy would not have had the news broadcast that the priests Vega, Pe-drozo and Angulo were at the head of the mob of a thousand or more bandits that set on fire a train bearing 188 human beings in Mexico, and then shot the poor unfortunates that sought to emerge from the furnace. It does not sound well. Some might not think it Christlike. And then again some might try to ape the priests or even to reverse the procedure. Dangerous! Yes I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Would the Bishops of Lombardy like to have it widely known that in the United States Senate for forty days, from January 14th to February 23rd, Senator Heflin of Alabama literally overwhelmed the government with evidence that the Roman Catholic church is a plotter for war, an enemy of American schools, a political vampire and trickster, a disciplinarian of politicians, an assassin of reputations, an assassin of presidents, an un-Christlike, brutal, bloodthirsty hypocrite? Would that be dangerous to the bishops? They succeeded in keeping that out of the newspapers. Would they like to keep it from the people altogether?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy do not want it known that the people of Chile after a terrible fight have succeeded, at least for the present, in separating their government from the Roman Catholic Church and have issued orders that no more money be paid out of the national treasury into the pockets of the Roman Catholic priesthood. You should have seen how this item </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">real news was twisted before </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it was allowed to </span><span class="font7">get into the Catholic controlled press of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New </span><span class="font7">York.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">■m</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy are alarmed that over the air, into the homes, behind the walls, anybody might listen to the news from Silesia, Poland, that, in total disregard of all justice and all decency, the police, at the instigation of Roman Catholic priests, seized the body of a dead Bible Student, ordered it buried in a Roman Catholic cemetery, stood guard while a priest went through the usual flummery on such occasions, and threatened to arrest any Bible Student who either talked or sang. The bishops fear the time when conditions might be reversed. They know they have not a leg to stand on. They wish to hang on to their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy do not want it known over the radio that the United States government has been fighting their fight in Nicaragua, fighting against liberty lovers and fighting to saddle the country with Roman Catholic domination, Roman Catholic schools and Roman Catholic churches supported from the public treasury. They want to keep such things quiet and to make them appear entirely different from what they actually are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nor do the Bishops of Lombardy wish it generally known that the Pope in one breath approves Governor Al Smith’s declarations regarding separation of church and state, and in the next one threatens to excommunicate all French Catholics recently united to fight for the same identical principle. It might lead some people to indulge in circulation of blood above the neck and eventually give them an idea that they were being treated like idiots by the Holy Fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy are in a bad way. Their pals in Mexico tried to plunge the United States into war with a people that are trying desperately to get an education, to learn how to farm the soil effectively and how to get rid of a clerical ring that, like the Old Man of the Sea, have tightly twisted their legs about the necks of all the poor peons below the Bio Grande. They do not want it known how badly they lost out in their desperate venture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy would be sore if they lived in America, and knew that here the news is broadcast about Cardinal O’Connell fighting the fight of Big Business to keep the the children of Massachusetts tied to the wheel, so that he can live on the fat of the land. The more the people know about it the shorter will be his sultanate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy do not want it generally broadcast that occasionally a Protestant judge here has courage enough to haul a Roman Catholic priest into court and denounce him and practically take the hide off him for preying upon the mind of a poor old dying Irishman so that he could get the bulk of his money. The bishops are for the money but not the publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy do not want it broadcast that Lindbergh’s father while in Congress tried in vain to force open the prison walls of Roman Catholic institutions all over America so that the truth regarding their inner workings might be shown to the light of day. They want the great honor and publicity of officiously blessing him, so that one of their cardinals could get into the picture; but they do not want it known that Lindy’s dad was even more courageous than he. Lindy should have refused the blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And finally the Bishops of Lombardy would never want to hear in Italy such a speech as Judge Rutherford gave at Toronto on July 24th, which went broadcast in the English tongue all over the planet. In that speech he took the clergy collectively, and made such a show of them before the world as was never before provided for the delectation of mankind. And he showed the world what will take the place of this diabolical device of the Devil which has done more than all other forces to keep humanity in ignorance and sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A hardened newspaper man in New York, one who has not been to church for a generation, said as he listened to the Judge’s address showing up the clergy and showing that Christ’s kingdom is to take their place, the Devil's place, that he could and did believe every word and that he felt like hugging the Judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bishops of Lombardy are right. The radio is dangerous! It will make Christians in place of timorous, snivelling, wishbone backed parishioners; and when that happens all the horse-collar theologians, and all the other hounds in the mangy pack, -will be through for good. They can throw off their expensive skirts and frocks, and get to work and earn an honest living; and it will be earth’s greatest blessing. It will be the Millennium! Hooray for the radio </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">(Judge Rutherford’s Address at Toronto, Broadcast from 58 Stations.)'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Made in support of Resolution passed in full on page WT, ff.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font7">OD made of one blood all nations of men to dwell upon the earth and gave to them equal rights. Foreknowing the evil influence that would be exercised over all governments of men God foretold that a small minority would rule and oppress the great majority; that during that period of oppression and suffering the peoples would desire freedom and a righteous government administered for the general welfare of all; that they would be disappointed and suffer; that the cries of the peoples would ascend unto God and in His due time He would hear them; that He would deliver the peoples from the oppressor into full freedom and give to them a government of righteousness under which they shall enjo) peace, prosperity, and the blessings of life. Therefore He caused His prophets to write concerning the present time these words: that “the Lord . . . hath prepared his throne for judgment; and he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble” (Psalm 9:7-9); and “a king shall rule in righteousness, and princes-shall rule in -judgment”.—Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only by the Lord’s arrangement can freedom come to the peoples. God’s due time has now come when the peoples of earth must know the truth concerning the cause of suffering and the remedy for relief. All true Christians are doing their part to tell these facts to the peoples that God's name might be glorified and that the peoples might know that their freedom is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom'</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270907_files/g_E_19270907-9.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HE foremost nations of the world jointly call themselves “Christendom”. The rulers by this term claim that they are Christians, having and exercising faith in God and in Christ, and that their combined governments constitute “organized Christianity”. The claim is not only unique, hut it is fraudulent and hypocritical. By such false and hypocritical claim the multitudes of peoples have long been held in bondage and have been deprived of their just rights and privileges. God’s due time has come for “organized Christianity&quot;, so-called, to be placed before the people in the proper light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a true Christianity composed of faithful men and women who unselfishly follow in the footsteps of Christ. There is an organized system called &quot;Christianity” or &quot;Christendom”, which is false and is the instrument of oppression wielded by the hand of the Devil. Jehovah through Christ established true Christianity on the earth, and in the days of the apostles it progressed. A few ambitious men, influenced and directed by Satan, defiled true Christianity; and their fraudulent course has made Christianity, as it is generally understood, a stench in the nostrils of honest men. This exact condition God foretold through His prophet Jeremiah </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(2: 20)</span><span class="font7"> who wrote concerning professed Christianity: “Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?” -—Jeremiah 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Organized Christianity” or “Christendom” today is Satan’s organization fraudulently parading under the name of Christ. Early in the history of man the Devil caused men to call themselves by the name of the Lord and to thereby bring reproach upon God. That same Devil has caused ambitious and selfish men to organize and carry on vhat Is now called “organized Christianity”. The purpose is to deceive the peoples, turn them away from the true God, and to keep them in subjection to a selfish and unrighteous system of government, of which Satan is the invisible overlord. (2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4) xL government that oppresses the multitudes of the common people and shows special favors to the wealthy, is an unrighteous government and therefore an ungodly nation. Such could not in truth be called Christ’s kingdom or Christendom. It is therefore apparent that when the name of Christ is given to an unrighteous and oppressive government that name is fraudulently so used and for a wrongful purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Who Rules</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270907_files/g_E_19270907-10.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HE kings and presidents of the nations are in fact the rulers. They are ordinary mon filling their respective places and are mere symbols of rulership. The ruling power behind the seat of authority that shapes the course of the nations of “Christendom” is Satan the Devil. He is the opponent of God and the enemy and oppressor of men. Satan’s visible instruments are those</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eelfish men who combine and form a system of government which rules and controls the peoples. The three classes of men that make up these ruling powers are, to wit, high financiers, called “big business”; professional politicians, called “statesmen”; and the orthodox clergy, called “religious leaders”, who manufacture and dispense religion. These three classes in combination constitute the small minority that rules. Disregarding the obligations laid upon them the selfish men composing the ruling minority have lived vainly and recklessly for their own pleasure and at the expense of the multitudes. For a long time the peoples have borne them up and supported them and thereby endured great suffering and sorrow. And now I submit the testimony of their own witnesses which proves beyond a doubt that “organized Christianity”, so culled, is a fraud and deception, a g real system of oppression, and a menace to the general welfare of the peoples.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>High Finance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE multitudes, in the sweat of their faces, produce the wealth of the v orld. High financiers are few in number but great in power. They produce no wealth but obtain it through fraud and deceit practised upon the peoples, and then use it for their own wicked pleasure and to oppress the multitudes and to keep them under control. High finance fixes the price at which the producer must sell his products to the distributer, and also fixes an exorbitant price which the consumer must pay to the distributer. High finance has established chain stores all over Christendom, and the producer must sell to these stores at a ridiculously low-price or not sell at all, and the stores in turn sell to the consumer at exorbitantly high prices, which the consumer must pay or starve. The produ-er gets but little, the consumer pays much, and the high financiers that produce nothing reap enormous and unreasonable profits. The result is that the small merchant is pushed to the wall, and the chain stores do the business, and the peoples pay the bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The financial record in the United States Treasury’s office discloses that in one year (1919) seventeen woolen mills made a clear profit of 100 percent on their capital stock; that corporations operating canning factories that can the fruit and vegetables produced by the hard labor of others in one year made a profit of 2932 percent; that clothing stores made a profit in one year of 9826 percent; that the aluminum trust with a capital of only $20,000 in one year (1923) made a profit of 1000 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wealth of America is constantly on the increase, but today in that land there are 524 banks less in number than there were six years ago. The large ones are swallowing up the smaller ones. Big Finance is taking possession of all. Kirby Page is authority for the statement that 20,000 men control practically every bank, tuiot company, and business enterprise in America. From Samuel Untermeyer. the distinguished American lawyer who for a long while represented Big Business, I quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been greater concentration of the Money Power in the pa-t me or ten years . . . than in the preceding fifty year*. The process of absorption is likely to continue until a few groups absolutely dominate the financial situation of the country. ... It has come to pass that less than a dozen men in the City of New York are for all practical purposes in control of the direction of at least seventy-five percent of the deposits of the leading trust companies and banks in the city and of allied institutions m various parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Federal Trades Commission in America in 1922 reported that six corporations controlled then one-third of the American water power; eight corporations controlled more than three-fourths of the anthracite coal fields; and two corporations controlled the greater portion of the iron-ore reserve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These heartless corporations profit in the lives of human beings. To them the life of man is nothing except to be used for their selfish purpose. Recently it was disclosed that forty percent of the milk sold in New York City is adulterated and that with the connivance of the Public Board of Health. It is then sold at a large profit to the poor, and the babes and the sick and the afflicted suffer by reason thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These facts and figures I am giving as they relate to America. Other nations of ‘•Christendom” or “organized Christianity” arc equally as bad, and many of them much worse. In every nation of Christendom the minority is favored and the great majority are oppressed and suffer.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Statesmen</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE so-called statesmen of the nations are those who hold the offices and feed at the public trough upon the fat of the land, and of course produce nothing. Their jobs depend upon obedience to high finance. In fact high finance is the bulwark of ‘&quot;organized Christianity”, so-called, and its power and influence have corrupted the politicians of every nation. The politicians are the men that make and enforce the laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the last American Congress a bill was pending to build a great dam at Boulder Canyon, in the Colorado River, for the purpose of reclaiming millions of acres of arid lands and to produce electric power for the benefit of the public. Jodali T. Newcomb, solicitor for Big Business that opposed the bill, declared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I represent an investment of nine billion dollars and wo do not propose to let the goveinment enter into the poner business at Boulder. The bill has no ehance to pass. It will not pa=s a- it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It did not pass. More than 120 million Americans cannot reclaim the arid lands of the desert and produce electric power for their own use without the consent of a few heartless men who are known as “Bio Business&quot;. This gang of highwaymen are a part of “organized Christianity’’, so-called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The corrupting hand of Big Business has been laid upon men in high political positions and corrupted every department of every government of “Christendom’’. Senator Reed, of the United States Senate, recently declared in a public address: “The time has come when the people should rise up and drive out the leprosy of corruption which has spread through the nation’s capital.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The peoples go through a form of election supposedly to select their public servants. But most of these political statesmen are elected and controlled by the defiling influence of “'Big Business”. From Mr. Justice Ford, long in public life and who speaks with authority. I quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In my experience I ham found the public service corporations, the street railroads, the telephone, the lighting companies in particular, to be the mo-t prolific source of political corruption in the state. They are more directly dependent upon governmental favors than anv others, and indeed the profits of their business flow from the special privileges which they procure and hold from the government, both state and municipal. Tn my day at Albany those, corporations plied their nefarious business of corrupting the people’s representatives so openly that a blind deaf-mute could learn what was going on. Kot that legal evidence could be found against them. They were too shrewd for that. But every public man there was morally certain as to v.hat was going on, and in private corn mat ion it was freely talked about. These Public service corporations pollute the very fountains of public virtue; they debauch our public servants: they subsidize party organizations for their own purposes. All the powers of government are subverted to their base ends; and government of the people, by the people, for the people, is made a mockery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even the courts are corrupted by Big Business. When Big Business is pitted against the common people the people have no show in the courts. The words of Mr. Untermeyer are pertinent on this point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Kou here m our «oeial fabric is the discrimination between the rich and the poor so emphasized to the average citizen as at the liar of justice. Kowheie should it be le-ss. . . . Money secures the ahlc-t and rno-t adroit counsel. . . . Evidence &lt;&nbsp;an be gathered from every source. The poor must be content to forego all these advantages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When “Big Business&quot; desires to increase its holdings, and war seems to be advantageous to its selfish interests, it does not hesitate to provoke war between the peoples of different nations. At the bidding of “Big Finance’’ the politicians enact the necessary conscription laws which compel the common people from all parts of Christendom to kill each other while the representatives of “Big Business” and their allies hide in their holes. When the war is over, millions of the common people sleep in the dust of the earth; and within the brief period of blood and carnage there has been born another crop of millionaires, and then there follows greater lawlessness amongst the politicians than ever before. Upon this point a member of the United States Senate, Mr. Norris, is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The millions of our youth who went into that orgy of murder were promised a new and better order of things. Here, ten years later, they can see special privilege and the power of money more securely enthroned than ever in. the seats of the mighty. For the thousands of our young men killed, for our billions spent, for the countless millions of heartaches, we have what? We have polit ical corruption such as was never dreamed of before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The conscienceless politicians defiled by Big Business and the oppressors of the people constitute a part of “organized Christianity’ or “Christendom”, so-called, that rule and control the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who are the responsible ones for naming the harsh, cruel and paternalistic governments “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”! I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">answer: The clergy of the various denomina</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tions. </span><span class="font7">Ambitious for the approval and plaudits </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">men and with a desire to live in ease and eom-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;, fort </span><span class="font7">they have joined affinity with Big Business and professional politicians. The clergy pose before the peoples a« representatives of God and of His Christ and hypocritically induce the peoples to believe that they are Christians, and at the same time go exactly contrary to the Word of God. Jesus declared that Satan the Devil is the prince or ruler of this world and that he is the opponent of God. (John 14:30) Again in 2 Corinthians 4: 3,4 it is written that Satan is the god of this evil world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The world means organized forms of government under the supervision of the invisible overlord, Satan the Devil. In God’s Word it is written (James 4: 4) that he who is a friend of the world is the enemy of God. The clergy have voluntarily become a part of the 'world and friends thereof and therefore the enemies of God and of Christ and the enemies and oppressors of the common peoples. They call themselves and their allies, “Big Business” and professional politicians, ‘’organized Christianity” or “Christendom”, and have the effrontery to claim that these rule by divine right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In God's Word true religion is defined in these words: “To visit the fatherloss and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.” Contrary to this plain statement of the Word of God the clergy not only fail to comfort the widows and orphans but they advocate war. preach men into the trenches to die. and thereby make millions of widows ami more millions of fatherless children. Instead of keeping themselves unspotted from. the wc-rld they are literally spotted al] over by the world because they are a part of it. In the r&lt;ment World Wai their church edifices were recuiting stations, and almost every clergyman advocated the shedding of human blood. For this reason God, through Ills prophet, says of and concerning them now: ’For in thy skirts is found the Hood of the souls of the poor imwents: 1 have rot found it by secret search, hut upon all these.” (Joj emiah 2: 34) What class of men wear skirts except the preachers or clergy ? They are the guilty ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon this point I submit the following indisputable facts: Admiral Fiske during the World War said: “The Christian religion is at this moment being made to exert a powerful influence, not toward peace but toward war.* Secretary of War Lane said: “The War could not have been won without the churches.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ, whose name these clergymen have fraudulently assumed and. by which they have named their “organized Christianity”, said: “Thou shalt not kill.” But the clergymen are the most ardent advocates of war and the most vehement and vindictive in their expressions again their fellow men. Before America entered the World War an election for mayor in the city of New York’ was being held. One candidate was opposed to America’s entering the war. The distinguished clergyman, Ur. Van Dyke, on tliat occasion said: “I’d hang everyone, whether or not he be a candidate for mayor, who lifts his voice against America entering the war.” And this is a sample of the dispensers of religion from “organized Christianity’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bev. Chas. Ganster from his American pulpit “advocated the organization of an association to murder those persons who do not stand up when the Star Spangled Banner is played”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergymen of Germany told the people that they represented the same God and the same Christ that the clergymen of England and America represented. Although Christ is the Prince of Peace, and declares against killing, the clergymen of Germany urged their people to kill in the most fiendish manner the common people of the allied armies of Britain. Ukewise the clergymen of Britain and her allies urged the killing of the German people and their allies, and the clergymen of both sides tried to induce the people to believe that they are Christians. In proof that the clergymen are a part of the world and the allies of “B<sup>;</sup>g Bufflness” that makes war L read the tes Jimmy of the R&gt; v. George Parkin Atwater, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The representative of the Interior Church in France </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font6"> the lArtcd Slates Ann mersca-. an army, t ith cannon and rifles and machine guns and its instruments of destruction.

Its worship has its vigil in the trendies, and it® fasts and fraJs; its piayer® are in act®, and P® choir is the cra«h of cannon and the thrilling ripple of machine gnus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T)r, Newell Dwight Hillis, pastor of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, was one of the most vehement advocates of America entering the World War. Did he act upon the authority of Christ? No; not Hillis. The American Bankers Association commissioned him as a missionary to Europe. He did the bidding of that heartless and cruel financial association. He prepared the sermons which hundreds of thousands of other pastors throughout America delivered, advocating war, urging the young men into the trenches and the people to buy bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Hillis was not content with urging men into the jaws of death, by which he earned and drew his pay from the American Bankers Association, but went to the extreme in expressing his malice. When the war had ended, instead of visiting the widows and the fatherless and bringing them comfort, as Christ had commanded, Hillis still breathing vengeance of blood against an unfortunate and helpless people wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Society has organized itself against the rattlesnake and the idlov feier. Shepherds have entered into a conspiracy to exterminate the wohes. The Boards of Health are planning to wspe out typhoid, cholera and the black plague. No other. i=o. Worse of their fellow man have finally become perfectly hopeless with reference to the German people. They have no more relation to the civilization of 1918 than an oiang-outaiig. a gorilla, a Judas, a hyena, a thumbscrew, or a scalping knife in the hands of a wtc age. These brutes must be cast out of society. . . . There wifi shortly be hold a meeting of surgeons in this country. A copy of the preliminary call lies boicre me. The plan to be diwiwsed is ba«ed upon the Indiana State law. That law authorizes a State Board erf Surgeons to use upon the per-on of confirmed criminals ai d hopeless idiots the new painless method cf sterilizing the men. These =urgron&lt; aie preparing to aihocate the calling of a v. otld conference to consider the steiilizat .on of 10.000.000 German soldiers and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">t-&gt;</span><span class="font6"> gi( gallon of their women, that when this generation of Germans goes, civilized cities, states and races may be ind of this awful cancer that must be cut clean out of Tno body of society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No general, no man in the army, nor any war lord ever gave utterance to such diabolical and wicked words as those written by Hillis. These clergymen are the ones who, with pious faces and sanctimonious words, tell the peoples that their organized system of oppression and murder represents Christ on earth and therefore constitutes “organized Christianity” or “Christendom”. They have been defaming the name of God and of Christ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few ultra-selfish men constitute “Big Business”, and they control the commerce of the world. They do it by the power of money unjustly wrung from the hands of the multitudes of toilers. They control the elections because the politicians elected to office enact and enforce such laws as they want. They own and control the public press and publish only what they desire the peoples to read. This lecture I am now giving will not be published by them because they do not v. ant the peoples to hear it. The radio, which Cod has brought to light for the benefit of the peoples, the same selfish interest is now seeking to control. The same power controls the clergy and uses them for selfish purposes. In time of war they use the clergy as recruiting officers to hurry men into the jaws of death. This is the unholy alliance that hypocritically calls itself by the name of Christ and has induced the peoples to believe that it is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth. On the contrary the Scriptures declare this unholy alliance to be a part of Babylon and of the Devil's organization. All nations have been made blind drunk by its false representations and teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the unholy alliance is pursuing a systematic campaign to amalgamate the common people of all Christendom into great military organizations. The false slogan of the World War was that it would “make the world safe for democracy&quot;. Every sane man knows that it destroyed democracy. &quot;Big Business’’ and its allies now hope to hold the common people in subjection by making them a part of the harsh and cruel war machine. Succeeding in this the Devil, in his ghoulish glee, and to the reproach of God and Christ, would say. “This is Christendom or organized Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The unholy alliance called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity” for its support and maintenance depends upon the multitudes of the common peoples. It holds up the peoples and robs them of their just rights and the fruits of their honest labors. Without the consent of the multitudes of peoples the poor are forced to fight and to kill their fellow man without a just cause or excuse, This “organized Christianity”, fraudulently so-called, has caused the common peoples to bear great burdens of unjust taxation in order that the few might live wantonly and recklessly. It has caused the peoples to bear the burdens of war that a few might gratify their selfish desires. The multitudes o.f suffering ones, with bent bodies and broken hearts, have gone into untimely graves. Those not supportin ' the unholy alliance are told by the clergy that to them death is hut the opening of the gates of a burning h»ll wherein th°ir torffwe will never en L</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Christ means the Anointed One of God, the Messiah, the One appointed by Jehovah through whom the promised blessings must come to the people.

<p><span class="font7">Now God lias set Ills Son Christ upon His throne, as foretold by Ills prophet in the Second Psalm, and bids all the nations and peoples of earth to hoar and obey Him. The old work! has ended and God’s kingdom i- at Land. The rulers of the earth wore duly served with notice of this fact a vear ago. The nnholv alliance has received due notice thereof. But instead of heeding the message from Cue Word of God the rulers of the world, to -s.it, those constituting the unholy alliance, walk on in darkness and continue to oppress the peoples. The doom of “organized Christianity” or Babylon is sealed? Tie groans and cries of the peoples oppressed by that wicked system have ascended up to the God of heaven. To the oppressors composing that evil system the great Jehovah now says: “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall b® a witness Against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, erieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.”—James 5:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day of God's vengeance is at hand; and He v ill punish that wicked system calling itself “organized Christianity*’, because it has oppressed the common peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A city is a symbol of an organization. The unholy organization called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity” in the Scriptures is called “a city’’. To that wicked city God now says: “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished ? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. . . . A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he wall give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind [of trouble] shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”-—Jeremiah 25:29, 31-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The World War stopped in 1918 in order that notice might be given to the peoples of earth concerning the name of Jehovah God and His purposes tov’ard men. That witness has been in progress during the past eight years. Notice has been served upon the world powers, and now notice is being served upon all the common peoples. Jesus declared that when this witness is done, and because the ruling powers will not heed the same, there shall come upon the world the greatest time of trouble owed known and it shall be the last.—Matthew<sup>7</sup> 24:14, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Millions of honest people who are now' held in subjection to “organized Christianity”, but who are meek and willing to be taught, are asking, What shall we do? To such Jehovah now says: “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment: seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—Zephaniah 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Word of God and the physical facts prove that “organized Christianity” or “Christendom” is a failure. She is even worse than that. She’ is a menace to peace and prosperity. She is art instrument of Satan the Devil. Abandon her and flee from her as rats flee from a sinking ship. She is sinking into oblivion never again to rise. She is going down in a time of trouble such’ as never before was known. To the people the Lord now says therefore: “Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.”-—Revelation 18:4.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>The Blessings</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">COHE ruins of Satan’s false system clear®!! away, there shall arise a new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteousness, according to God’s promise. (2 Peter 3:13) That righteous government shall rest upon the shoulder of Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace. His name shall be called by the people Wonderful Counsellor, because He will guide them in the right way.; He shall be called the Everlasting Father because He will give life to the peoples. And of His peace and blessings there shall be no end. —Isaiah 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Wrs </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to Cease</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE curse that war has laid upon the peoples will then be lifted for ever. Never again shall there be war between the peoples of the nations. Under the reign of the righteous Messiah the peoples of the nations shall beat their instruments of war into farming implements and nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.— Isaiah 2:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A lion is a symbol of the Devil, and a ravenous beast is a symbol of the Devil’s organization on earth, made up of the cruel &quot;Big Business”, big politicians, and big preachers. God, through His prophet, promises that in the kingdom of Messiah there shall be no lion nor ravenous beast there, because the Devil will not be permitted to operate. He will have no cruel financiers, nor professional politicians, nor any hypocritical preachers to do his bidding. The people shall dwell together in safety and follow that which is right.—Isaiah 35: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The poor will no longer be oppressed. In the courts they will have fair and equitable consideration, because it is written that “with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth”.—Isaiah 11:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the righteous reign of Messiah no cruel corporation can own the houses in which the people dwell, or compel them to pay exorbitant rents. The people shall build their own houses and live in them and plant their own vineyards and eat the fruit thereof, and no one shall make them afraid.—Micah 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the poor cry for bread and the rulers give them a stone; they cry for a fish and the clergy give them a fiery serpent. Under the righteous reign of Messiah there shall be a great feast of fat things spread for all the people and they shall eat and rejoice. No hypocritical prohibition preachers will be permitted then to operate with bootleggers and take away from the people the proper use of wine while they themselves use it unlawfully.—■—Isa. 25: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the righteous reign of Messiah clergymen will no more be permitted to frighten the people and keep them in ignorance of the truth. Then the knowledge of the glory of the Lord shall fill the whole earth as the waters now fill the sea, and every man will know the Lord and His righteous way from the least to the greatest, and that knowledge will be free.—Ilabakkuk 2:14: Jeremiah 31 : 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In that righteous government here on earth no more can men called doctors practise on the people and hide their mistakes in the graveyard, because then the Lord will lead the people in the right way and bring unto them peace and health and cure them of all their ailments until no more shall any man say, “I am sick.”— Jeremiah 33: 6; Isaiah 33: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It shall then be if a man who has been wicked shall turn away from his wickedness and do right and obey the Lord he shall live and shall never die. (Ezekiel 18:27, 28) That is the time of which Jesus spoke when He said: &quot;If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death” (John 8:51) &quot;Whosoever liveth, and believeth in me shall never die.”—John 11:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In that time old men shall return to the days* of their youth, and their flesh shall become fresher than that of a child. (Job 33: 25) Then God will restore to perfection of body and mind all the obedient ones on the earth until the earth is filled with a happy, joyful and vigorous people.—Acts 3:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seeing that God has in store these marvelous blessings for the people through the kingdom of Christ it is easy to see why the Devil has organized a false system called “Christendom''’ or “organized Christianity”, by which system hypocritically he deceives the people and turns their minds away from God’s provision for their blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s kingdom of righteousness is at hand. The evidence shows that the day of restitution has come in which the obedient ones of mankind shall be granted full freedom and be restored to the perfection of body enjoyed in Eden. Therefore with confidence it can now be stated that millions of people now on the earth will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people desire peace, freedom, prosperity, life and happiness. All thinking persons must now see these can come only from God’s kingdom through Christ. They can never be realized by or through the false system called “organized Christianity”. The hypocritical and evil course of “Christendom” is an insult to God and to Christ. It is the deceiver and oppressor of tha people. It is completely under the control of Satan the Devil. It depends for its support and maintenance upon the multitudes of peoples, while at the same time it continues to defraud and oppress the people. Let the multitudes of peoples completely and entirely withdraw all support morally, financially and otherwise from “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”, so-called. Let them give their heart’s devotion and allegiance, entirely to God and io Christ, ths Prince of Peace, who is now earth’s rightful King. Let them dwell together in peace and do , good to each other and be ready to receive the blessings which God has in reservation for those who love and obey Him. The day of complete freedom is at hand ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The peoples should therefore for ever abandon and forsake “organized Christianity” called “Christendom” and turn their hearts and minds and their allegiance wholly to God and His Christ for the following reasons, to wit:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(1) Because Christendom is the Devil’s organization operated by him to keep the people in subjection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(2) Because it is an instrument of oppression which has been used to make the burdens of men grievous to lx- borne.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(3) Because it is false, hypocritical, and wicked, and against the interests of the multitudes of the peoples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(4) Because it holds out absolutely no hope for the betterment of the peoples.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">'5) Because God’s time has come vlien that evd and hypocritical system shall be destroyed in Gw greatest time of trouble the world has ever known.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">u) Because God commands all the peoples v ho love Him to flee from that unrighteous sys-tc.n of so-called “organized Christianity” and thereby escape the dire calamities that shortly shall befall her.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">U) Because God has set His anointed King, Christ Jesus the Messiah, upon His throne, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">bids all the peoples of earth, to hear and obey Him; and those who so do shall receive and for ever enjoy the blessings of complete freedom, everlasting peace, prosperity, life, liberty and happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now, Mr. Chairman, based upon these assigned reasons, I move the adoption of this resolution and I ask my audience, both seen and unseen, when the vote is taken, that those vrho are in favor arise and express themselves by crying out, Aye. Before voting upon it I wish to say the message today, by God’s grace, has gone out from Maine to California, from Canada to Mexico, and we hope to the uttermost parts of Christendom.

I take this occasion to express, upon behalf of the International Bible Students, my great appreciation of the cooperation of the National Broadcasting Company.

<p><span class="font7">The Resolution will be found on pages 777, 778.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">[Radiosfrom Station WBI!R on a nave of 256 3 ireters bj R. H. Baiber.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">LL Christian people agree that it is necessary to overcome something in order to get into heaven. Just what that something is does not seem to be clearly defined in the minds of many people; in fact, there is a variety of opinions as to what must be overcome. Jesus said: “Bo of good cheer: 1 have overcome the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people, of a fanatical turn of mind, understand the world here mentioned as meaning the good things of earth, its pleasures, its beauties, its friendships and its loves; and fearing that in some way they would be contaminated by these, and thus rendered unfit for heaven, they have secluded themselves in convents, monasteries and other places of solitude, and denied themselves the beauties and bounties which a loving God has so generously scattered everywhere for the blessing of His intelligent creatures. They expect that in some way this course will win the divine approval and entitle them to heaven’s choicest gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seemingly they fail to observe that Jesus did not thus seclude Himself, neither did the apostles ; and it is very difficult to see how they could obey the Scriptural injunction to “preach the word”, and the command of Jesus himself, found in Matthew 28:19,20: “Go, disciple all the nations, teaching them to observe all things which I have enjoined upon you.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott) </span><span class="font7">Such a course of isolation makes voidmany other texts which I have not time to mention hero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our observation has been, also, that by thus secluding themselves such persons gradually develop a sanctimonious, holier-than-thou manner, which God calls hypocrisy, and which will most effectually debar them from heaven. Thus w<sup>r</sup>e ©an see that this idea does not square with the Scriptures, with Jesus’ example, or with common sense: and that the results ato not satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mistaken Ideas &amp;f Overcoming</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">NOTHEE class of Christian people think that overcoming the world means to over-eon the wickedness in the world, such as gambling, drinking, grafting, lying, stealing, inur-dc-mg, etc. They fall to see that when Jesus saul, “I Lave overcome the world/’ it could, not moan th^«A v’ic'md f&gt;n&lt;l sinful thincrc’ for we aio told that Jesus was holy, harmless, and imdealed and separate from sinners. Therefore overcoming the world cannot mean overcoming them things. They also fail to see that there are heathen and inf dels who do none of these thxW’s, a,id jet do rot expect to go to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am not trying to prove that we should not trj to Keep from sin ami everything evil; for there are many scriptures which show that to be pVasinc to God one must abstain from evil, as far as possible. 'What I am trying to prove is that to get, to heaven not only is it necessary to abstain from sm, but that one must do more than that, viz: he must overcome something: He must overcome the woild; and I propose to show just what is meant by “the world” in this talk. I propose to show that the churches, the clergymen and Christian people in general have not had the correct understanding of what the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">it rid</span><span class="font7"> moans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Impossible to Overcome the Flesh</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270907_files/g_E_19270907-12.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">EFORE proceeding with my argument, I want to call attention to another erroneous idea respecting overcoming. It is this: Many Christian people think that they must overcome the weaknesses of their flesh in order to get to heaven. This is another great mistake. We very often hear the words quoted, as though it &quot;were </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">Scripture text, “Overcome the world, the flesh and the devil”; and these are referred to as man’s threefold enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Search your Bibles diligently, and you will not find a single text which says that a man must overcome his flesh. It is very fortunate for us that there is no such, text; for it is absolutely impossible to do so. If it could be don® it would mean that a man could make his flesh perfect, without sin. If this were possible, then that man would not need to go to the throne of grace to confess his sins, for the reason that he would have no sins to confess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If it wore possible for a man thus to perfect himself, then it would be unnecessary for Jesus to die as man’s Redeemer. Such a thought engenders spiritual pride and boastfulness, which is characteristic of our holiness friends, who are the chief exponents of this idea of fleshly perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible hi unmistakable terms tells us that it is impossible to overcome the flesh. I quote Galatians 5:17’ “For the fle^h Jn«+eth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the tilings fha^ ye would.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Listen also to Paul’s statement, in Romans 7:15,19: “For what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that I. do. . . . for the good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not. that I do.&quot; Every honest man has to confess that he has the same experiences that Paul did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fleshly weaknesses are those infirmit'es which we inherit from oim foibears, simli as envy, jealousy, selfishness, anger, pride, the tendency to hold a grudge, wilfulness, evil speaking, evil surmising, etc. According to the Bible the Christian is to strive against tlwse weaknesses as much as possible; he is to mortify the deeds of the flesh, which means to kill as far as possible these fleshly desires; he is to do his best at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then for all his shortcomings the Lord has graciously prepared a throne of grace, given us Jesus as our advocate and intercessor, and invited us to come boldly to this throne of grace, and confess our sins; and He also assures us that He will forgive us our sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These scriptures being true, it is apparent that God knew that we could not overcome these fleshly tendencies, and in His love and mercy made this provision for the forgiveness of the same. I desire to emphasize the thought that to get the forgiveness the sinner must come penitently to the throne and confess his sins, and ask for the forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of our holiness friends claim that they have not sinned for years; but I wish to call attention to the fact that the very claim itself is a sin. I will give the proof of this statement (1 John 1:8,10): “If w® say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us’’; “If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ri?? Important Question</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HUS we can see that the question of what a Christian is to overcome becomes a most important and interesting one. In Revelation 3:21, we read the words of our Lord Jesus: &quot;To him that overeometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I call your attention to two things mentioned in this text: First, Jesus had to overcome in order to sit down with Hm Father in His throne; second, Jesus .-mid that we must overcome &quot;even as I olfo overcame''’. Therefore the Christian must overcome exactly what Jesus did. and in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What did Jesus overcome? Listen to His words in John 16: 33 • &quot;In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be cf good cheer: I have overcome the world.” Again in 1 Jolin 5:4,5 we read: He that is ‘ begotten of God overcometh the world: . . . and this is the victory that overeomdth the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the 'world, but he that be-iieveth that Jesus is the Son. of God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It should be easy for anyone to see that faith is not involved in overcoming fleshly weaknesses nor in overcoming the sinful things of the world. Whatever must be overcome, according to these texts, must needs require a large degree of faitli, in order to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word world has a great variey of meanings both in the Bible and in daily usage in our day. For instance, we say: The world is beautiful, referring to the scenery on the earth. Again we say: The world is gone mad, referring to the people on the earth. We say again: The world « corrupt, rotten, referring to the political, financial, industrial and religious organizations collectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now notice some of the different ways that this &quot;word world is used in the Bible. Psalm 97: </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font7">reads: “His lightnings enlightened the world.” “Lightnings” here mean truth, and “the &quot;world” means the people, and the text simply means that it will be the flashes of truth from Jehovah </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God that will enlighten the race of mankind. lAgain, we read that Jesus gave His flesh for file life of the world, which means the life of 'til® people who have lived on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Psalm 50:12: “For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.” This refers to the earth and the bounties of nature. In James 3:6 we read: “The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity.” This means that there is a tremendous amount of iniquity and evil done by the tongue, by gossiping, tai.tli.ng, lying, slandering, evil speaking, and in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">World Often Cleans Devil’s Orgiimzation</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270907_files/g_E_19270907-13.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HK word vorld is used a great many times in the Bible as a name applied to the Devil’s organization. ‘'Try feu people realise that the Devil has an organization, a wicked, cruel, vicions otganizatioii. through which he deceives the entire him'an race and which he uses to slander Jehovah God and to misrepresent His purposes; an organization that is founded on fraud, hypocrisy, sham, deception; an organization which has only one purpose, viz: to keep the people under Satan’s control, by deceiving them about God and Ifis loving designs for the race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We often speak of the political world, and mean that world or order or arrangement of affairs relating to polities and dominated by politicians: we also speak of the financial world, and mean that world or order or arrangement of affairs relating to financial things, and dominated by financiers. Just so Satan has a realm, a world which he dominates, vliere he rules and controls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has some servants who cooperate with him willingly, because they have his spirit. But the majority of those who are serving Satan are his dupes, that is, he has blinded them, deceived them and lied to them, until they think they are right in doing the things they do. So with the rulers of the political world and the financial world. There are some who willingly cooperate in the profiteering and lying and graft, because they have the spirit of selfishness controlling them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Others, and by far the majority of people, cooperate with them because they are deceived into thinking that there is no better way, and that conditions cannot be changed: yes, they even think that it would be unpatriotic, almost treason, to try to change conditions for the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There are millions of people on the earth who are cooperating with the Devil’s organization, not recognizing it as such, but recognizing and </span><span class="font7">acknowledging the wickedness and evil, the bribery, the graft and the corruption of the same, and yet who are so thoroughly deceived by the Devil that they would consider it almost an unpardonable sin to try to change conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They would consider themselves, and the majority of people also would consider them, as very unpatriotic, as traitors and worthy of death, if they should make an effort to right the wrong or even point it out. This is the spirit that operates in the Devil’s world. This spirit is what holds it together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All true Christians, all honest people, cannot have any sympathy with such a spirit. They cannot in any way support or sympathize with evil, injustice, corruption or oppression, and hence would not want to cooperate with the Devil in doing these things, when once they see what his kingdom is, and especially when they see that the Lord has another and a better way.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>What the Devil’s World Is</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19270907_files/g_E_19270907-14.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">OW let us get down to real facts and find out what the Devil’s organization is, what his world is. It will be necessary for me to speak plainly, and yet I shall speak in love. I am well aware of the fact that those who are cooperating with the Devil’s organization, because they are selfishly profiting thereby, because it is to their advantage in some way to do so, will not like this talk. I will not expect them to like it; for the same class of people who heard Jesus denounce their hypocrisy and their oppression in His day, sought to kill Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures reveal the fact that Satan’s organization, or world, has two parts, a visible and an invisible; and that the invisible part is called by the name heavens, and the visible part is called earth. It shows that the heavens consist of some angels that sinned; that these are organized under Satan as their leader; that these angels, having become wicked, are now called devils and demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Revelation 12:9 tells us of a time when the Devil and his angels will be cast out of heaven. Matthew 25:41, tells us that the lake of fire is prepared for the Devil and his angels. In Mark 3: 23, 24,26, the scribes charged Jesus with casting out devils by the prince of devils; and Jesus said, “How can Satan cast out Satan? and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">if a </span><span class="font7">kingdom be divided against itself, that king</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">dom </span><span class="font7">cannot stand. . . . And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand.” In these words Jesus acknowledged that Satan has an empire, a world. But these angels organized and controlled by Satan constitute only a part of his world, the invisible or spiritual part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the Bible there is another part to Satan’s world, a visible part, made up of wicked, tyrannical, unjust and cruel men and women. These two parts, visible and invisible (called heavens and earth) are thoroughly organized. Satan controls them both; he uses them to accomplish his wicked purposes. Unitedly, they constitute what the Apostle Paul calls “this present evil world”.—Galatians 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul refers to both parts of this world again in Ephesians 2: 2, in these words: “In time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air [the invisible part], the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience [the visible part].”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Its Visible Phase</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HILE the invisible part of Satan’s world is made up of certain angels that sinned, that have Satan’s spirit and disposition, all cooperating together to accomplish a certain purpose, the visible part is made up of organizations of men dominated and controlled by Satan, and cooperating with Satan to accomplish the same purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These organizations of men are wicked and corrupt; and everybody on earth knows that they are wicked, selfish, cruel and corrupt. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Yet </span><span class="font7">few people dare oppose them; for to do so is considered treason, and will arouse a storm of protest from these organizations themselves. And since they control all the means of communication of knowledge and news, the schools the pulpit and the press, they are able to control the people, some through fear, and others through selfish interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These organizations are known to men as big business, big politics and big religion. Everyone knows that these organizations are working together, that their interests are one, their aims are one; and that these interests and aims </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">to keep the masses of people under their control for selfish purposes. Everyone knows that the masses of the people fear this combination. Everyone knows also that no good thing can </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">said about the combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has only one purpose in having an em</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">pire </span><span class="font7">or world, and that purpose is to misrepresent God, slander His name, and lie about His Word, the Bible. To do this it is of vital importance to the Devil that the people be kept </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">ignorance of God and His plans, His love and His teachings. More than that, it is of vital importance that something else be substituted for the plans and teachings of God, and that the people he deceived into believing that these substitutes are the truth. This is exactly what Satan has done, and is still doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Revelation 12:9, the apostle says that Satan is the deceiver of the whole world. How has he deceived the world? The answer is, By using the two parts of his organization, his world or empire, and through these teaching false doctrines, false ideas of government, finance and religion, all of which keep the people in bondage, in ignorance and superstition, and make them the dupes and tools of the Devil in his one work of misrepresenting God and blaspheming His name.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>How the Two Parts Cooperate</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19270907_files/g_E_19270907-15.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">ET us see how the visible and invisible part of Satan’s world cooperate in this work of deception. In the garden of Eden, God told Adam that in the day that he ate of the forbidden fruit he would surely die. Satan said to Mother Eve: ‘God doth know that thou wilt not surely die.’ This was a direct charge that God was a liar, while the truth of the matter is that the Devil was the liar. In John 8:44, Jesus said that Satan was a liar when he uttered these words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wicked angels, serving Satan’s purpose, are trying to perpetuate that lie by using spirit mediums and others, and through them deceiving the people into believing that they are talking to their dead friends, when in fact it is simply these wicked spirits, lying spirits, demons, devils, imposing on the people. God said: “Thou shalt surely die”; and the Bible says that the dead know not anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Practically all the clergymen on earth are cooperating with the Devil and these wicked deceiving spirits in perpetuating that lie; for all of them teach that the dead are more alive than ever and fully conscious either in heaven or </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now notice carefully the words of Paul which, he said, applied to our day, the last day. 1 Timothy 4:1: “The spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” Thus we see that there are seducing spirits and that devils teach doctrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To teach a doctrine, a spirit has to use some human agency, and I ask my audience: Who it is that are teaching doctrines on this earth? Everyone of you know that it is the clergymen. It is the creeds formed by clergymen that misrepresent the Bible and the God of the Bible. They teach for doctrines the commandments of pen.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>What the Devil Does Not Want</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">HE Devil does not want people to study the</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270907_files/g_E_19270907-16.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Bible; for if they did they would soon get their eyes open to what the Devil is doing. It serves his purpose best to keep the people in ignorance of the Bible. Do the clergymen cooperate with the Devil in this work ? Let us see. For a thousand years the Catholic Church did not let the masses of people own a Bible and kept it buried in a language which the people could not read; and when it was translated into the people’s language, this same church persecuted to the death the men who did the translating, and confiscated and destroyed the Bibles. To this day the priests and popes advise that the laity should not try to study it because they claim the people cannot properly interpret it. Among the Protestant clergy the same position is taken, viz., that the clergymen are the only ones who can properly interpret the Bible. Many clergymen tell their people that the Bible is an old fiddle that you can play any tune on, by which they mean to discourage investigation of it. Other clergymen claim that it is a book of mystery, and not intended to be understood; and their purpose is to discourage investigation of it. Jesus said: “Search the Scriptures,” while the clergymen advise against it. Pray, tell us whom are they serving then? Why are they so interested in keeping the people from investigating the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The answer is that the people would soon learn that the Bible does not teach the trinity, eternal torment, immortality of the soul; that it does not teach the divine right of kings or clergy. The people would soon learn that the human ordination of the clergy is a stupendous fraud, that the Bible teaches that the dead are actually dead and that the creeds are false on this point. Thus the people would see just what the Devil’s empire is, and would no longer serve or cooperate with it; and this would interfere with church attendance and the collection box. The people can be controlled only as they are kept in ignorance.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>What the World Really Is</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font7">OST of the profiteering financiers and politicians belong to some church, and lend their dollars and influence to perpetuating these falsehoods and shams on the people. The profiteers are the ones who plunge the nations into war, and the clergy stand up in the pulpits and disgrace the cause of Christ by preaching the boys into the trenches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul said of true Christians: ‘‘The weapons of our warfare are not carnal.” The Devil's organization urges the use of carnal weapons, such as poison gas, liquid fire, cannon, battleships, armies and navies. This great, powerful, entrenched, wicked and oppressive organization, visible and invisible, is called the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil has deceived the people into thinking that it is the proper thing. Men speak of Christendom, thus connecting the name of Christ with the Devil’s organization, with all those wicked, cruel, unrighteous and corrupt systems of earth, which are so full of graft, bribery, oppression and deceit. It is a criminal libel against Jehovah God and His Son, our Lord Jesus, to charge that that either one of them has anything to do with these organizations. It is blasphemy of the worst kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus said : “My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants light.” This clearly teaches that the servants of the Lord must not, fight. But the elements which make up this present evil ’world, viz., big business, big politics, and big preachers, are a unit on this matter of fighting. They unitedly promote war by urging larger and yet larger armies and navies: by urging the governments of earth to be prepared for any emergency, with stupendous supplies of poison gases, liquid fire, and every other devilish and fiendish device for the destruction of life and property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They are the first ones to cry “Treason!” “Pacifist!” “Bed!” and through the pulpit and the press to heap odium and reproach upon every honest-hearted, liberty-loving, peace-loving and law-abiding citizen who dares to protest against these evil machinations of the Devil's kingdom, his world.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Present Evil World is Popular</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">WHILE present evil world is very popular. It</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">is lauded to the sky, by its supporters. The pulpit and the press reek with the laudations of those profiteers, politicians, financiers and pulpiteers that impose the most wicked, oppressive measures on the people, and make the people foot the bills against their will. The spirit of the world is selfishness. It is destructive of liberty. It suppresses man's God given free moral agency, and makes him only a part of a great machine controlled by the Devil, and doing a work which every honest man acknowledges is unjust and wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men and women have been taught that there is no better way, until they believe that this statement is true. But there is a better way clearly outlined in the Bible. It is God’s way^ When put into operation it will give to the people just what they desire. It will establish and inculcate righteousness, justice and peace on the earth. It will destroy the Devil and his evil world, both the visible and invisible part, as the Apostle Peter tells us in 2 Peter, 3rd chapter, where we read that the heavens (the invisible part of Satan’s world) being on fire shall be dissolved, and the earth (the visible part) and the things that are therein shall be burned up. This simply means that both are to be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a Christian discovers that this world is of the Devil, and that the Lord has a different and a better way of bringing blessings to the people, loyalty to God demands that he at once cease to cooperate with the Devil, and that he shall begin at once to cooperate with the Lord. He cannot do otherwise and be pleasing to God. This moans that he must take his stand against this present evil world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now notice some texts on this point, and bear in mind that these texts apply only to a Christian. James 4:4: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.” I ask my audience now, Are you the friend of the unjust, tyrannical, wicked, oppressive present order? If so, you cannot be the friend of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No Christian can cooperate with, nay, he cannot even sympathize with anything which is controlled by (he Devil, and and belonging to the Lord, 1 John 2:15 reads: &quot;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. I1‘ any man love the worid. the love of the Father is not in &lt;&nbsp;Ivm. For all that is in the world. the lust of the t’&lt;, E m&gt;.I th &gt;&nbsp;Inst of the eyes , and the pride of life, is r.ot of Tie <sup>T</sup>F’L&lt; r ’,jf A of th&quot; world.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Devil offers prizes to all who will cooperate with him. To some he offers honor among men, to others wealth, and to some preferment, or infmenre, or power. Some accept the world's prizes of being kings, queens, emperors. czars or presidents. Some accept its prizes of a religious nature, and prefer to be a pope, bishop, presiding elder, i everend, honorable, right reverend, doctor of divinity, father, rabbi, et«.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some are satisfied with being a power in financial circles, coal baron, steel king or a railway magnate, in the Devil’s world all the honors are given to men and none to God. It is our faith that enables ns to overcome the world, our faith in the fact that God's plan is the best, in fact, the only one that will bring permanent blessings; out faith in the knovdedge that the present world belongs to the Devil, that it is a curse, and that to sympathize with or cooperate with it will bring divine disapproval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus was tempted to jump off the temple top, so that men would regard Him as a hero; but He steadfastly refused to accept the honors of men, knowing that to do this would forfeit His Father’s approval. The' spirit of the world is selfishness. That means to get all you can lor yourself, regardless of the injustice done to others. What a temptation this is, and how difficult it is to overcome it, and how few succeed in so doing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only those who love the Lord can possibly succeed, those who have an abiding faith that the kingdom of Christ is the only panacea for all of earth's ills, those who love to do things that are right, true, honest, just and loving. All othm-s v,ill dc’iaht to cooperate with the Devils world, because it is to their selfish advantage to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s people are in the world, but not of it They are obeying the commands of their Ccptoin. “Come out of her. my people, touch not the unclean thing, my Lord.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">If it be that any one should take his stand against the “ D-wi’ and his organization, of court-e the Devil will do all in his power to defame, injure and kd! sneh. Tins he has always done. He killed I he Lord Jreus; aud Jesus said, ‘The servant re not above his master. It they have hated jto t‘ f-y will hate you.' But, adds Jesus. “Be thou faiiliLul unto death, and 1 v ill give thee a crov.n of lite.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To take one’s stand against the Devil’s world brings reproach, ridicule, persecution, reviling, and has brought death to thousands in the past. Any one who stands against the Devil’s worid will get no favors from that world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While we are not to sympathize with or cooperate with the Devil's arrangements in any way, no matter under what guise they are sail-’ ing, nevertheless, the Bible teaches that the Lord’s people are to be the most peaceable and most law abiding people on earth. If everybody were like the Lord's people there would be no necessity for jails, penitentiaries, policemen, wars, cannon, liquid fixe or poison gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who shall dwell on high? Isaiah 33:15,16 answers: “He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despisefh the gain of oppressions, that sliaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; be shall dwell on high.” In other words he that scorns to do and to teach the things that are taught in the Devil’s empire; he who has a faith so strong that he can take his stand on the Lord’s side no matter what men say or do or think. This is the victory that overcometh the world.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark71"></a>The First Great Prophet of Jehovah</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">[A juvenile Bible story radioeast from Station WORD on a wave length of 275 meters by C. D. Nicholson.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE first great prophet of the Lord was <sub>t</sub> Moses. We have learned considerable about him in previous lessons. The Bible says of Moses that he w<sup>r</sup>as the meekest man in all the world. As we consider the experiences which he underwent as the leader of the Israelites for forty years, we are able to understand why the Lord chose a very meek man for<sup>-</sup> leading the children of Israel to the land of promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most remarkable events which took place among the Israelites in their wilderness journey happened some months after leaving Mt. Sinai, less than two years from the time they left Egypt. They had now approached the land of promise, and Moses selected twelve men to make a search of the country to see where the best places were for them to settle. These spies found the rich new country abounding in fruits and crops, a land greatly to be desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, ten of the spies were cowards and fe.ued that the Israelites would not be able to take the land from the people already living there. When they made their report to Moses to this effect, the people were so discouraged that they literally cried in disappointment and were ready to return to Egypt. Two of the spies. Caleb and Joshua, had faith in the power of God to fight their battles for them, and assured Moses and the people that they should at once go into the land of promise; but the people vmre afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They seemed to forget that the Lord was their leader and that He was able to help them in every time of need. None of the wonderful things He had done for them during the past two years of their lives were even thought of. Tl.ey were depending entirely upon their own strength; and because of their unbelief and lack of faith in God and His promises, the Lord punished them by making them wander around in that barren wilderness for a period of forty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lesson vhich seemed to be the hardest for the Israelites to Iwin was that of not murmuring against Moses; for they overlooked the fact that Jehovah was their leader and not Moses. On one occasion the people murmured so bitterly that even the Lord lost patience with them and caused a great plague of red-headed serpents to break out and bite the people, killing many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The purpose in sending the serpents, however, was not the destruction of the people, but that they might learn to trust in the Lord and to acknowledge Him as their leader. He therefore caused Moses to erect a pole or cross, and on that crc ss to fasten a serpent made of brass or copper; and the people bitten by the serpents were instructed to simply look up to this figure on the cross which Moses had erected, and they would live. This was another picture of Christ and the work He shall yet do for all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the end of the forty years’ journey, MoseH work drew to its close. A new leader must be provided for the people; not that Moses was too old to lead the people, lust because he had accomplished that which the Lord wanted him to do in connection with the deliverance of His chosen &gt;&nbsp;people. Moses had finished the v ork that the Lord eave him to do, and the time had now come for him to die. Moses therefore called the leader of the various tribes of the children of Israel together and gave them counsel and advice, to serve them the remainder of their lives. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Moses took leave of the people in the plains, and climbed the tallest mountain in that part of the country vhieh was situated close to the river, from whose top all the land which God had promised to Abraham could be seen. When he reached the top of the mountain the Lord appeared again to Moses and showed him tins good land, and said unto him, &quot;This is the laud which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy see d: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, bet thou shalt not go over thither.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Moses lay down, his breath went forth, and he rvas dead. Then the most extraordinary thing any one has ever heard of happened. The Lord actually buried Moses in one of the valleys in the land of Moab. Just where he was buried no one ever kne-w, but the word was carried to the people that Moses was dead, and they mourned for him thirty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the Bible, Moses is to be awakened from the dead in God’s due time and will again walk upon this earth as one of its greatest rulers and teachers. Do you think any one else will know more about Jehovah and be a better instructor and lawgiver to the people than Moses?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">162. But most of the people would not believe that Jesus was really the Messiah, or Redeemer, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">whom God </span><span class="font7">had promised to Abraham so long </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ago. </span><span class="font7">Jesus lived in a very modest way, and had simple clothing to cover Him. The people expected to see a great king arise with mighty armies and fine uniforms and brass bands, and rush around doing something with a big noise. That was their idea of the Redeemer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">163. Was that the right idea, and according </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">what God had said? No; Christ is called the Lamb of God, and we know that this means He </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">very gentle and quiet in all His ways; for a lamb does not make a big noise and rush around with a show of importance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">164. So the people did not think that this kind, gentle man, who walked from place to place, and 8id and said such wonderful things, was really the Messiah, or Christ. Only a very few really good people, who believed the promises that had been handed down from the time of Abraham, were willing to follow Jesus and learn of Him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">165. Twelve men in particular were chosen by Jesus to preach the Word of God to the people, and these twelve men were inspired by the holy spirit to write parts of the New Testament. These twelve good men were called apostles of Jesus. Apostle means </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">messenger.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">166. Jesus was a perfect </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">man.</span><span class="font7"> The Bible tells us that while He was on earth, He had the nature and likeness of a man. He was a spirit being, like God Himself, before God sent Him to earth. But when Jesus came to the earth, He was simply a roan, a Iraman being; but He was perfect-</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">167. God was His Father, which means Life-giver; and so Jesus was perfect. He did not make any mistakes or do or say anything wrong during the 'whole of His life on the earth. Think of that! In this way Ho was better than Adam; for Adam made the biggest mistake that has ever been made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">168. God allowed the people to put Jesus to death after His three and a half years of teaching and healing the sick. The people thought they were doing right; but of course we know that they ■were very wrong, and did not realize what they were doing. However, they crucified this gentle, loving man, who had never don® toy; harm. They took His life. And that was all in fulfilment of God’s plan, as He told it to Abraham so long before.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">169. Here is a short group of the main facts of this wonderful plan of God, that -will help us to see it all more clearly: Adam was a perfect man. He disobeyed God, and this made him imperfect. All of his children have since been imperfect. Everybody would have to die, for ever, and never see the green grass or hear the birds in the trees again. God docs not intend this to be so, however. He loves everybody very much.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">170. There have been no perfect men since Adam, of course. So none of Adam’s children could pay the price of a perfect life for a perfect life. If some perfect man would give his life to pay for the life that Adam lost, everybody would have a chance of living for ever; for God will make all the dead live again. But there were no perfect men on earth.</span></p></li></ul>
