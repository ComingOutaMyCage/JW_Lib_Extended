<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">TO NEW READERS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The TOWER comes to you as unpretentiously as the ministers of the early church.  We present no list of titled and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-renowned contributors--none whose fame would command your attention to the subjects we present.  But we come to you with the Bible as God's Word, and seek to enlist your attention to its statements and your obedience to its requirements and thus to lead the hearts and minds of some of God's children away from the jarring confusion of precept and doctrine, prevalent among the various divisions (sects) of Christians, into the harmony, beauty, simplicity, and confidence, which come from the study of God's Word and its acceptance as a harmonious whole and a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">self-interpreter.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It would be but natural that you should wonder </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">how</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> these things could be true, yet not recognized long ago by earnest Christians; and why so many of those in the churches manifest a bitter opposition to things so full of harmony with God's Word, and so fully vindicating the justice, wisdom and love of our heavenly Father.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In answer to your supposed queries, we suggest that if a broad view of God's dealings be taken, it shows that he has a plan with reference to men.  While he was pleased in past times to reveal an outline of that plan, it was nothing more; no details were given.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">details</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the plan </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">began</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be recognized since Pentecost.  The light of revelation shines with special brightness on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ends</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the ages.  Upon the ending of the Jewish age which was the beginning of the Gospel Age, new and special light shone out relative to the blessed privileges about to be enjoyed in the Gospel Age.  Remember, too, that it came from the Scriptures, written long before, but which were never before appreciated or understood. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter and Paul, all quoted the prophecies and applied them to the events taking place and due to take place, in their day--the opening of the Gospel Age. The prophecies had been there for centuries, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">revelation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or understanding of them, was reserved for those in the ends of the ages.  (See `1 Cor. 10:11`.) So now in the closing of the Gospel Age and dawning of the grand Millennial Age, we should expect the light to shine out brightly relative to God's plans for this incoming age.  And so it does.  Search and see.  Gem after gem of precious truth now glows with unparalleled lustre to the diligent searcher, not because of his superior ability to find it, but because God's due time has come for such to understand it.  Soon the blessed bow of promise shall span the whole heavens, and weeping earth shall dry her tears and shout for joy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is no more surprising that these truths relative to God's plan for the blessing of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all mankind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should have been but dimly seen heretofore, than that the call of the Gentiles to be heirs of the Abrahamic promise, (`Acts 11:18`; `Eph. 3:5,7`; `Gal. 3:29`,) should have been but dimly seen until the Gospel Age began to dawn.  We can understand prophetic scriptural statements only as they become due.  Thus--&quot;Light, (truth, was long ago) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sown</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the righteous.&quot;  When due, the light springs up and gradually unfolds.  Thus our Father has made abundant provision for the household of faith and the true servants shall bring forth things both </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">old,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the household may have meat in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">due season.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The cause of the opposition on the part of many to the truth now due, is the failure to recognize this progressive and unfolding character of God's revelation of his plans.  Most Christians take for granted that good men of the past who walked in the light then due, had all the truth worth knowing.  Knox, Calvin, Luther, Wesley and others were, we believe, followers in our Lord's footsteps of self-sacrifice and devotedness to God; but more truth is due in our day than in theirs.  According to God's plan, the light should shine more and more until the perfect day.  Therefore many Christians of to-day make a great mistake, and sit in comparative darkness, when they might be walking in glorious light, because they search the theology of these men instead of the Word of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">O, that all would turn away from musty church creeds of times past and give more earnest heed to the ever living, ever fresh, ever unfolding, ever new Word of God.  Again, others take the Bible and search it only for the purpose of seeing how nearly they can make it to fit either their mental or written creed. If your habit has been such, we hope you will at once resolve to lay aside all human teachings as authoritative, and hereafter judge all you hear or read by the statements of Scripture.  If you believe anything, make sure that you have Scriptural statements warranting it. Prove all things, hold fast that which is good, and cast away all else.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The action of the nominal church today relative to the light now shining clearly resembles that of the Jewish church relative to light in the end of their age.  They reject every new ray of light because it would conflict with some cherished theory or statement of their creed.  They are so enwrapped with their own plans and arrangements for converting the world, that they are unwilling to hear that God has a better, grander, and infinitely more comprehensive way of dealing with evil, and blessing and teaching the world.  Their ears are so stopped by the din and confusion of their own religious efforts that they cannot discern the plan of Jehovah.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Satan is doubtless interested in the promotion of the confusion of sects, and stimulates and encourages that zeal which is not according to knowledge, and thus hinders their hearing Jehovah's voice, saying, &quot;Be still and know that I am God, (the mighty one); I will be exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted in the earth.&quot; (`Ps. 46:10`.)  The power to do this is with our Father, and not with us.  When he gives the saints with Christ their Lord, the heathen for an inheritance --when </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he gives</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the kingdom under the whole heavens to the people of the saints, THEN, and not by poor human effort, will God's kingdom come and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven. (`Dan. 2:35,44` and `7:18,27`.)</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A FORMER PASTOR'S LETTER</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">TO THE PRESENT PASTOR AND HIS</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CONGREGATION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER:--Your note, stating that you and the church of which you are the pastor, desire me to write to you, is at hand.  Not doubting the general interest of yourself and those for whom you speak, in the welfare of a former pastor whose relations were mutually most amicable, I still suppose that it is particularly on account of my having withdrawn from the ministry and membership in the M.E. Church that you desire to hear.  To those who listened to my preaching during my pastorate at Townsendville, it is unnecessary to state that I was at the time a Methodist.  My notions of the teachings of Scripture were gained while yet a child.  They were taught me by Methodist parents, in Methodist Sunday-schools, and from Methodist pulpits.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I find that years before I was capable of forming for myself intelligent opinions concerning even the general scope of Scripture teaching, they had already been moulded, and I had unquestioningly accepted the opinions of others and made them my own.  I am now disposed to believe, however, that it was with some degree of mental reservation that I accepted </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">some</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the doctrines of orthodoxy.  How else could I, while professing to believe in endless torment for the unrepentant, associate with them, accept their many kindnesses, and speak to them from the pulpit on themes often tending to divert their attention from, rather than attract it toward, so horrible a fate.  I believe, however, that by the churches I served, I was adjudged faithful to my duties; and, though coming short of my own model of what a minister of Christ should be, I have the happy consciousness of having ordinarily walked up to the degree of light I possessed. To relate my varied and peculiar experiences after resigning my pastorate would transcend the limits of an ordinary letter, and perhaps would be without interest to those for whom I write.  Suffice it to say, that after about two years of such experiences, there fell into my hands, providentially as it seems to me, a publication which was the means of a decided change in my understanding of much of God's Word; a change, however, which led me to much more exalted views of the character of God, and served to harmonize many passages in his Word which before appeared either unmeaning or contradictory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Though disposed to look with much suspicion on all that cast a doubt on so-called orthodox teachings, I nevertheless found them so fatally assailed by God's own Word, that my prejudices, one by one, yielded, and orthodoxy crumbled and lay in a mass of ruins at my feet.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You are now ready to ask, which of these doctrines appear to me to be out of harmony with the teaching of the Word, that my prejudices, one by one, yielded, and orthodoxy crumbled and lay in a mass of ruins at my feet.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You are now ready to ask, which of these doctrines appear to me to be out of harmony with the teaching of the Word?  The present opportunity will allow me to speak of but few of these, and I will select such as I trust will appear plain to you.  Orthodoxy teaches that the present life irrevocably determines the future condition of every human being.  Though it is nowhere stated</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R659 : page 1::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">in Scripture that there is not for any a probation after this life, it is preached and enforced much more vigorously than many things which the Bible </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">does</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> affirm.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If it be true, as preached, that there will be no probation after this life, then surely much the larger part of the human family never have a probation.  No person can be said to have a probation until made acquainted with that for which he is to be held accountable.  Besides, if there be no future probation, many passages of the sacred Word are to me unmeaning; nay, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are positively contradictory. Please notice `Luke 2:10`, &quot;Behold, I bring you good tidings of GREAT JOY, which shall be to ALL PEOPLE.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are all aware that a large majority of the PEOPLE who have lived and died, even since these words were uttered, never heard of the event here referred to.  In what sense, therefore, has it been GREAT JOY to them?  What possible advantage can they have derived from it?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, in `John 1:9`, it is stated of Jesus, &quot;That was the true light which lighteth EVERY MAN that cometh into the world.&quot;  How, permit me to ask, has he lighted those millions of the race who never heard of him?  How can this be true, unless there is to be a trial for them in the future in which this light shall be received?  Again, in `1 Tim. 2:6`, it is stated that Christ Jesus gave himself a ransom for ALL, to be testified in DUE TIME.  Now, we all know, that it has not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">yet</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> been testified to ALL.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, if this Scripture be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be; so we can reach no other conclusion than that the DUE TIME--God's DUE TIME--for much the larger part of the human family to receive this testimony will be FUTURE.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I might cite many other passages that are susceptible of a rational interpretation only in this light, but surely they will occur to your minds.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, you may ask, Why is it not taught in the Scripture, if there is to be an opportunity</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R659 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">for those who have never heard of him of whom it is declared, &quot;There is no other name given under heaven, among men whereby we must be saved?&quot;  To this I answer, It is so taught, and not in a single text merely, but in many Scriptures.  Before referring you to such teachings, however, permit me to remark, that the doctrine of a future probation for the world is not more strange to nominal Christianity to-day than was that of a salvation for the Gentiles to the Jewish Church at Christ's first coming.  In illustrating my position, I will call attention to a single instance from Scripture; not because it does not contain others, but because the limits prescribed me will not permit their notice.  This one instance, however, will be sufficient, I trust, to answer every reasonable objection.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We will select what is usually regarded as the most marked illustration of Divine wrath, viz.: the Sodomites.  Now, if we can show from the plain statements of God's Word that these people are to come back to life, in order that they may have an opportunity of having it testified to them that Jesus Christ gave himself a ransom for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of believing this testimony if they will, and of receiving the benefits of belief, viz.: justification: if we make </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> plain, then we think the case of the others will appear, at least, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">very hopeful.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But, first, let us learn from the Great Teacher, who &quot;knew what was in man,&quot; what he thought of these Sodomites.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In his preaching he compared them with the Jews, and particularly with the people of favored Capernaum (`Matt. 11:23,24`). Jesus here says, &quot;If the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day.  But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus we see that it was for want of light that these people were destroyed. We see also, that Jesus teaches a time of retribution--future--which shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tolerable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for ALL, even for the people of Capernaum, who rejected Jesus and his miracles; and yet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more tolerable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the Sodomites that perished in ignorance. Are we not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ready to say, this is surely, as we have a right to suppose God would deal with those to whom in their lifetime he had never given light and knowledge?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, turn if you please to the prophet `Ezekiel, 16th chapter`, and see that God is teaching the Jews of their final restoration to the &quot;land of promise,&quot; as he had long before promised to Abraham.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Bear in mind that the prophet is writing about 1,000 years after the destruction of this people, and that Jesus says (`Luke 17:29`), &quot;It rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Notice now, that in the `46th verse` the prophet refers both to the people of Samaria and to those of Sodom, and in the `53d and 55th verses` plainly states that these people who were all destroyed SHALL RETURN to their FORMER ESTATE.  In the `60th and 61st verses` it is again stated that God will establish with Israel an everlasting covenant, and that he will give to her Samaria and Sodom for daughters (that she may instruct them and bring them into harmony with God's plans).  Thus we see that the promised blessing to Israel is not alone for herself, but that she may be God's agency in extending light and knowledge to &quot;ALL PEOPLE.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How well all this comports with Peter's words (`Acts 3:21`), in which he declares the &quot;times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all of his holy prophets since the world began.&quot;  A careful study of these holy prophets can scarcely fail to discover this glorious doctrine of a restitution of all things interwoven in all their writings.  We are able in this light to comprehend John's definition of God's character--(`1 John 4:8`)--&quot;God is love.&quot; Is it not notably the case that the fear of future torment is now the principal incentive held out to induce men to come to God?  John says, however, that &quot;He that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">loveth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knoweth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not God.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another teaching of the nominal Church, which I believe to be at variance with the teaching of the Word is, that all believers are to be of the body or Bride of Christ.  The Bible teaches that the result of belief is justification to that condition which Adam forfeited by his disobedience.  He forfeited human perfection; moral--mental--physical.  Belief in Christ as the Redeemer, is the condition on which it may be recovered. The conditions to the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (`Phil. 3:14`); the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">holy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> calling (`2 Tim. 1:9`); the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heavenly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> calling (`Heb. 3:1`), are far different. These require not only justification, but that their justified human nature shall be presented to God a living sacrifice-- conditions which never were required until the narrow way to life was opened up by Jesus Christ (`Heb. 10:20`; `Matt. 7:14`). Those who follow Jesus' footsteps in this narrow way are promised immortality.  &quot;For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself&quot; (`Jno. 5:26`); and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (his body) shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him (`1 Jno. 3:2`), spiritual beings, no longer human, but partakers of the Divine nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">By rejecting the Bible doctrine of a future probation--after the dead shall have heard the voice of the Son of God and come forth, as illustrated in the case of Lazarus, the widow's son and others --by rejecting this and other Bible teachings, the nominal Church has been thrown into confusion and led into many errors.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That this confusion and these errors have largely contributed toward bringing about a rapid increase of infidelity, both within and without her own pale, I firmly believe.  What is the spiritual condition of the Church to-day?  Where are the revivals of former years?  Alas, they exist only in name, or are the result of the efforts of a few professional revivalists. The barriers that formerly separated between the Church and the world are mostly swept away, and the man of fair worldly prospects, with whom she refuses to share all her privileges, must fall below the world's standard of morality.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These, dear brethren, are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">some</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the causes which led me to sever a connection which I once so highly prized, and to accept doctrines which, though they may bring reproach and obloquy, I believe to rest on the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Commending you to God, who is able to make all grace abound toward you, and trusting that this letter may lead you to a more careful study of His Word, which only is able to make you wise unto salvation, and to trust less in human creeds and traditions, I remain,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Your servant, for Christ's sake.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUSTIFICATION DEFINED.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;--`Rom. 5:1`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The word justification has two meanings, which are closely related; one is to prove that a thing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> right, the other to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">make</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a thing right which is wrong.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Webster defines the word justify thus: I. &quot;To prove or show to be just or conformable to law, right, justice or duty-- to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">vindicate as right.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  II. &quot;To pronounce free from guilt--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to absolve.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These terms are used in these two senses in Scripture.  As illustrating the first definition, viz.: proving or showing to be just and right, notice that our Heavenly Father is said to be justified and Jesus also.  When John preached repentance for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the people who believed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified God; i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they acknowledged that God had been just in condemning and punishing them as sinners;</font><br />
<br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">his dealings were vindicated as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">being</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">right.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Jesus as a man was tried or tested in all points (the world, flesh, and devil) as we are, &quot;yet without sin&quot;--&quot;In him was no sin.&quot;  He was &quot;holy, harmless, separate from sinners.&quot;  Jehovah was his judge, and he justified, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> declared him to have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">proved</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> right and just.  He was vindicated as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">being</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">right,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or, as we read, he was &quot;justified in spirit and received into glory.&quot; (`1 Tim. 3:16`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His unspotted humanity he gave up to death, to pay for us, the penalty of Adamic sin.  Thus his death was not for his own sins, but for ours.  &quot;He bore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sins in his own body on the tree.&quot; &quot;Jehovah (in harmony with his own desire) laid on him the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">iniquity of us all.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ Jesus gave himself (his manhood) a ransom for all.  And one of the best evidences that in God's sight he was free from all sin, is found in the fact that though he gave his humanity as a ransom, yet God, while accepting the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sacrifice for our sins, raised Jesus to life on a plane far above the human. Had he been a sinner, this would have been impossible, for God's law condemns every sinner to death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now notice the second meaning of justification--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">making right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of something which is wrong.  This is the sense in which the term is applicable to us, who by &quot;the fall&quot; are wrong and sinful.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God cannot say arbitrarily, though you are sinful, a violator of my just laws, I will declare you to be right.  No, he must be just--justice is the foundation of his throne; everything rests upon it.  If you are imperfect and sinful he cannot say that you are righteous.  If you were righteous he could not declare you a sinner, nor treat you as such.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do you remind us that there is none of the Adamic race </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">righteous</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--no, not one--and urge that, therefore, God cannot justify any of us?  We reply that he cannot justify us in the first sense of the word, as seen above, but there is a way which God's love and wisdom have devised by which he can be just and the justifier of those sinners who believe in or accept Jesus. (`Rom. 3:26`.) Thus our justification is in the second sense explained above; that is, we who are wrong, sinful and condemned before God, are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">made right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by having our sins and shortcomings settled by another-- by having the perfections of another set to our account.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, some one may raise the question as to what is the cause or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">basis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of justification. One claims that is by Jehovah's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grace,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not because our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has been paid, and quotes `Titus 3:7`, &quot;Being justified by his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grace.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Another claims that we are justified, not by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grace,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor by a ransom, but by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and quotes `Rom. 5:1`, &quot;Being justified by faith.&quot;  Another claims the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the basis of all justification, and refers to `Rom. 5:9`, &quot;Being now justified by his blood&quot; (death).  Are there three ways to be justified?  No, answers Jesus, &quot;I am the way....No man cometh to the Father but by me.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What can there be about believing in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Why not believe in Peter or Moses or Samson or Isaiah or Jeremiah? Why could not God justify those who believe in these as well as those &quot;who believe in Jesus?&quot;  There must be something special and peculiar about Jesus, something different from all other teachers and prophets that we may be justified through faith in him, and not by faith in them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, what is it to believe in Jesus? Is it merely to recognize the fact that such a person once lived in Judea and died on a cross?  Surely not; many prophets perished in Judea; many persons died on crosses.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In explanation, we suggest that if the context be studied, these texts will be found harmonious.  It is by Jehovah's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grace</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or favor that we are justified, for</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Grace first contrived the plan</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       To save rebellious man.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are justified by faith, too; that is, we must by faith grasp the agency of God's grace--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--before we can realize its full value.  But down under all is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--Jesus' death--the basis of all justifying </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the channel of God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grace.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  These three things: the value of the ransom as the power of justification, the grace which provided it, and the faith which appropriates it are all beautifully joined by Paul in `Rom. 3:24,25`. &quot;Justified freely by his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grace</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redemption</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in his blood.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The secret is, that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> died </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But, does some one suggest, that as sin is the cause of all death, therefore Isaiah, Jeremiah, Peter and others died because of sin as well as Jesus.  We answer, yes; they all died because of sin; all except Jesus died because of their share in the sin, because they were descendants of the condemned Adam, whose life was forfeited by sin.  Thus all but Jesus die because of the inherited taint.  Jesus died </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">because</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of sin, too, but not because of inherited taint or personal guilt.  His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> came direct from God and was unforfeited; but he died for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our sins.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Jehovah laid upon him the iniquity of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all.&quot;  &quot;Him who knew no sin [either personal or inherited] he made a sin offering [treated as a sinner] on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in him.&quot; (`2 Cor. 5:21`, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Diaglott).</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus we see why God justifies believers through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not through themselves, nor through apostles or prophets.  Now, we see why there is no other name given under heaven or among men whereby we can be saved from the penalty of the fall.  It is because he gave his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinless, perfect humanity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a RANSOM--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">substitute</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for ours.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Did God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unjustly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> lay upon the willing substitute the iniquity of us all? Ah, no; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for the joy set before him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he endured the cross, despising the shame. Therefore his present exaltation and glory.  Wondrous wisdom of the infinite Jehovah!  Who can find a flaw in his glorious plan or charge him with injustice?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now we see what it is to believe in Jesus. Not merely believing that such a man lived and died, but that he lived and died free from all condemnation and sin--attested and approved of God--and that his death was for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sins.  And thus we see how God can </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> justify those who believe in and accept of that sacrificial offering of the humanity of Christ Jesus.  Now we can see that the sins and the frailties of the Adamic family were cancelled by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom price</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which the second Adam gave.  The first Adam's sins were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imputed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the second, and the second Adam's human purity is imputed to the first and his children--when they believe, and thus they are justified to live again.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is blessed to realize, too, that the spotless one who bought us by the sacrifice of his humanity is now highly exalted to the spiritual condition and power, and thus as a new creature--partaker of the divine nature--he will continue to carry forward the Father's plan. Soon he will bring from the prison-house of death those whom he bought, that they all might be (thus) saved (from the penalty of Adam's sin) and come to a knowledge of the truth, viz.: that they, by faith in Christ, are justified freely from all things and may come to perfection and harmony with God as before sin.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How Paul brings out this doctrine of justification in `Rom. 5:18,19`, showing the condemnation to death on all through Adam, and the justification out of death to life through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory throughout all ages. Amen.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God hath sent forth to be a propitiation (satisfaction) through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his blood; to declare his righteousness (right doing) in the remission of sins that are past....To declare, I say, at this time his (God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">righteousness:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. (`Rom. 3:24,25`.) Those who will study the chart in &quot;Food,&quot; page 105, will be helped in the understanding of this subject, and also the important subject of Sanctification, which should follow it, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cannot</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> precede it.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THE sentiment that it matters not what a man believes, so that he is sincere, is as unscriptural as it is absurd. Sincerity in belief has no more effect in warding off evil in the spiritual, than in the natural kingdom.  If the teachings and persuasions of a reputed chemist should prevail on you to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believe</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that arsenic is harmless, would it therefore be harmless?  Could you mix it with your bread, and you and your children eat it without injury to health life?  Oh, no!  Neither will the sincerity of your belief save you from the consequence of error in religious faith. Right belief--truth, God's truth, my brethren, is the only foundation on which you can safely rest your hope.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE LAW OF GOD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Christians are in the habit of looking at &quot;the law&quot; as a great enemy.  Why? Because it does not countenance the least sin.  It says, &quot;walk before me and be thou perfect.&quot;  Is this not right--could a perfect God recognize or make a law in any way imperfect?  Surely not.  The reason men count the law their enemy is that all have sinned, and ever since the disobedience of Adam they have been in the condition known as &quot;sinful flesh.&quot; Prior to sin's entrance, the law was Adam's friend, and justified him; but the condition of death obtained after sin had entered, and man in this fallen condition of death finds it utterly impossible to so live and act in harmony with his Maker, that God's perfect law would not condemn him.  And since </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are sinners, of course none but a defective law could recognize such persons as perfect.  The law of God has condemned all, and every one who has reasoning faculties seems to recognize that he is not perfect.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God has always had a law; even before the giving of it at Mount Sinai.  Since God always has been perfect, his laws always have been perfect, and condemned and opposed even </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the slightest sin.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Abel, Noah, Abraham, and all the patriarchs recognized the fact that they were sinners when they made altars and sacrificed thereon, before attempting to hold communion.  Thus they acknowledged themselves sinners and unable of themselves to approach God.  How different from the way Adam and God walked and talked in the garden!  No sacrifices or offerings for sin were there needed, for Adam was justified, or recognized as right by God's law.  Thus we see that what the patriarchs knew of God's law condemned them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The giving of the law from Sinai did not take away man's sin.  No, it only showed it the more fully.  Did the keeping of it ever justify any of them?  No; &quot;By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his (God's) sight.&quot;  Was the fault in the law, or in the people? Paul said, &quot;The law is holy,&quot; and God's commands &quot;holy and just and good.&quot; (`Rom. 7:12`.)  The imperfection was with mankind.  Since the law did not justify them, it must have condemned them, even as it had condemned the patriarchs.  Not any more really (for there is only one penalty--death) but more loudly.  They were no greater sinners than those of the Patriarchal Age who had not had the full law given them, but they were shown their condition as sinners more clearly.  Why?  That they might see their own fallen and imperfect condition, and learn the exceeding sinfulness of SIN, (`Rom. 7:13`,) and by this knowledge be prepared for the Redeemer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have seen that God always has had a perfect law which condemned every sin in every being, and how it was shown in different degrees to the patriarchs and Israel, yet that the effect was the same--condemnation--only more fully realized by those who saw the law most clearly.  Now, how about the great heathen world?  Surely a righteous law could not say: The heathen are RIGHTEOUS; unless they live in harmony with God.  And if you thought they were living in harmony with God you would not send missionaries to them.  No, they too, are condemned by God's law.  And as Paul says: These that have not the law (the full written law as given to Israel) &quot;show the work of the law written in their hearts,&quot; a spark of that principle of justice and knowledge of right and wrong which must have been an important part of the natural organization of the first perfect man, Adam; a spark merely, not quite extinguished by the degrading effects of sin.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What did this spark of conscience do for them?  It sometimes justified, and sometimes condemned.  But if their spark of conscience condemned them only ONCE during their lifetime, it showed that they were imperfect--sinners-- hence subject to the sin penalty, death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, &quot;all unrighteousness is sin,&quot; and &quot;sin is the transgression of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the law,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;the wages of sin is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  So we see that the only voice of the law of God to any who hear it is: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">You cannot live.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;All have sinned and come short of the glory of God:&quot;  Therefore must &quot;every mouth be stopped and all the world become GUILTY before God.&quot; (`Rom. 3:9,19`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There lay the whole human family dead and dying through sin; the law hanging up before them, they admit, is grand, &quot;just,&quot; and &quot;holy.&quot;  They were told that &quot;The man that doeth these things shall live.&quot; (`Rom. 10:5`; `Gal. 3:12`.) But O, they could not do them. Some tried hard, as Paul describes. (`Rom. 7:14-24`.)  When with their minds they resolved to &quot;do those things and live,&quot; they found </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in their members hindering and preventing.  When the striving ones found they could not deliver themselves from death, they exclaimed: &quot;Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death?&quot; (Diaglott) or, from the sin and death which has gotten possession of me. When he so cries out, he has reached the place God wanted to bring him to, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to realize that he can NEVER deliver himself from death and sin.  But some one asks: If he dies does not the act of dying fill all the requirements of the law, and could he not, after thus dying, be raised up by God?  No, you err in supposing that the act of dying is the penalty. Man has been dying ever since sin entered the world, but the penalty will not be entirely inflicted until all are dead.  The penalty is, that sinners shall have life no longer; they forfeit their right to live.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But when will the law of God release the sinner from the bondage of death?  Never; if he could not obey the law while </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partially</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> dead, he certainly cannot when completely so.  Ever since the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;fall&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect manhood</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through sin, man has been in a dying condition, sometimes spoken of as already dead (See `Matt. 8:22`).  And none but a perfect man could keep a perfect law.  But, says one, did not God send his Son into the world to show us how we could work our way up to spiritual life--appearing among us on the lowest round of the ladder, did he not point out to us the way? he being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thus</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;our forerunner?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This view in many respects is held by a great many, mostly &quot;Unitarians&quot; and &quot;Universalists,&quot; and like many other views has a mixture of truth in it; but as a whole it is far from being &quot;the truth&quot; on this subject.  Jesus did indeed &quot;lay aside the glory which he had with the Father, before the world;&quot; he did appear to &quot;set us an example that we should follow in his footsteps&quot; and to be &quot;our forerunner,&quot; but more, he is also our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Redeemer&quot; from the curse of the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Law.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The curse of the law upon us as sinners is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  How did he redeem us from death?  To redeem is to purchase back.  He is therefore said to have &quot;bought us with his own precious blood.&quot; Blood represents life--&quot;The life of the flesh is in the blood&quot; (`Lev. 17:11`), therefore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shed blood</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> represents </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrificed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life.  &quot;He gave his life;&quot; &quot;He shed his blood;&quot; &quot;He tasted death;&quot; all have the same meaning.  But how could his life purchase or redeem or buy ours?  He as a man, a perfect man, kept the perfect law; and was therefore uncondemned by it.  Therefore the same law which was the sinners' enemy condemning us to death, was his friend and guaranteed life to him.  But was he not born into the world under condemnation of death, as much as any other son of Adam?  No he was a direct creation of God--&quot;made in the likeness of sinful flesh,&quot; but &quot;in him was no sin.&quot;  If he had done sin or been born a sinner, his life would have been forfeited as was ours.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If born under </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">condemnation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as other human beings, he would have been as much a sinner as we, and as such would have been obliged to die for himself, and consequently would have nothing to give as a ransom for our life.  But he was perfect, he kept the law, had a right to perfect human life forever; But &quot;for the joy set before him,&quot; by the promise of the Father to raise him from the dead a spiritual body, he renounced the natural, human life, and gave it for our ransom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But when he arose from death, was not that a taking back of the price?  Yes, if he had taken back the same life which he had laid down; but he did not take back the human; he was quickened by the Spirit--&quot;made a quickening Spirit,&quot; raised a &quot;spiritual body.&quot;  There is a natural, human body and there is a spiritual body.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus, &quot;by his precious (valuable) blood&quot; (life,) we were &quot;redeemed from the curse of the law&quot;--death.  To what kind of life were we redeemed?  The same which man had before death (the curse) came; the same kind that Jesus gave for us, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> human life.  But we are promised spiritual life, and that we shall be made like unto Christ's glorious body?  Yes; it is a part of God's offer to us (during the gospel age,) that we die earthly and fleshly--natural--life, we may be reckoned as &quot;members of his body,&quot; and partake of the same kind of life as our Head.  If we leave our Father's house (the human) we may become espoused to the Lord of glory as his Bride.  In this arrangement we are reckoned as being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the perfect natural life first, else we could not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">give our lives.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Being justified to life, Jesus says to us, you can either have this natural life, or, if you will renounce this natural, as I did, and become dead to the world, you shall have instead, the spiritual life and body.  &quot;If we be dead with Christ, we shall live with him.&quot; `Rom. 6:4-8`.  &quot;It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him; if we suffer we shall also reign with him.&quot; `2 Tim. 2:11`. &quot;Ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings.&quot; `1 Pet. 4:13`.  &quot;Joint heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.&quot; `Rom. 8:17`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And it is because God thus waits until the elect number, the bride, the body, the Church, has &quot;filled up the measure of the afflictions of Christ, which are behind,&quot; that the &quot;restitution of all things,&quot; purchased for the world by the blood of Christ, is delayed and yet future. The Head suffered and died over eighteen hundred years ago; but all of the suffering and death of the body are not yet completed.  Not noticing this, has caused wonder on the part of almost all, that the benefits and results of the ransom have not sooner come.  (See Typical Sacrifices, in the Tabernacle Tract.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But would it be right for God to reckon the one righteous life given, as a full payment for the lives of the millions of sinners who have died?  Does not the price--one, for a billion or more-- seem like a short payment?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a reasonable question, and we will allow Paul to give it a reasonable answer.  He is a logical reasoner, as well as an inspired Apostle, and argues that, as God had seen proper to condemn all men to death on account of Adam's disobedience, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">so</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he had a right to reckon the second Adam a representative man, and justify to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all the race, in return for the sacrifice of this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> perfect life. &quot;For as by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one man's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall many be made righteous. &quot;Therefore as by the offense of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> judgment came upon all men to condemnation,&quot; (condemned to suffer the penalty of sin, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;even so by the righteousness of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the free gift came upon all men unto justification to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Remember that none now enjoy life; our condition is a dying one.  &quot;Dying thou shalt die&quot; was the penalty pronounced on Adam.  Death </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reigns.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The condition of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as it was enjoyed before death came, is what all men are justified to, by the obedience of &quot;Jesus Christ who, by the grace of God, tasted death </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for every man.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;For as in Adam (or by Adam's sin) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all die,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so &quot;in Christ (or by Christ's obedience, etc.) shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all be made alive.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> As the first Adam's bride was a party to the sin, so we see the second Adam's bride is made a party with her Lord in the removing of the curse.  O glorious plan, of our all-wise and loving Father, and the exceeding riches of his grace toward us in Jesus Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But says one, I thought that Jesus had nullified, set aside and destroyed the law; and that therefore man could approach God.  Oh no, that was a great mistake.  Would it not be strange, indeed, if the Father made a law, which we have seen was &quot;just&quot; and &quot;holy,&quot; and in fact the only one he could give because perfect and holy himself, would it seem proper even to think of Jesus as setting aside and destroying that &quot;just&quot; and &quot;holy&quot; law, or in any way making a league with sin or sinners?  No, no. He came to do the Father's will, and the law is the record of that will.  Jesus kept it himself, and taught the true meaning of it to be higher than the letter, and that to be &quot;angry with a brother without cause,&quot; was to violate the command, &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot;  No, says Paul: &quot;Christ magnified the law (made it larger and more minute), and made it honorable,&quot; showed, in fact, that that law could not be set aside or broken. He showed, too, by keeping it perfectly himself, that God's law was just, and not beyond a perfect man's ability.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we read, &quot;Christ is the end of the law.&quot;  What can that mean?  The trouble is you have not quoted the connections. The text reads: &quot;For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.&quot; (`Rom. 10:4`.) To whom is he this?  To believers. How?  Righteously, not by breaking it, but by righteously fulfilling its requirements, and we in him are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before the law.  Because we in him are reckoned dead to the world and alive toward God through him--our new life, another similar text reads: &quot;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are IN Christ Jesus.&quot;  Why are those in Christ not condemned?  Because, since coming into him by faith they have received of his spirit, and with him can say, &quot;I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.&quot; (`Ps. 11:8`.)  They are then alive spiritually though yet living in the dead body of sinful flesh which they are opposed to, and which by the Holy Spirit given they are enabled to &quot;crucify.&quot; These walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, and to all so walking in</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R661 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ, there is no condemnation from the law.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And in the glorious Millennial age, when all shall know God from least to greatest, when, &quot;the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the whole earth;&quot;--&quot;the times of restitution&quot;--there will be the same &quot;holy and just&quot; law, and under the &quot;Royal Priesthood&quot; after the order of Melchisedec (the order of an endless life), poor fallen humanity will be helped back again to that perfect condition from whence Adam fell; a condition in harmony with God's law, and therefore in harmony with God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But will they receive no punishment for misdeeds of the present life?  They will receive punishment, &quot;stripes&quot; in proportion as they had light and lived contrary to it.  As our Master explained, &quot;It shall be more tolerable for Sodom,&quot; in the day of judgment (in the age of trial) than for the Jews to whom he spoke, because the Sodomites had sinned against less light. (`Matt. 11:24`.) There will be many or few &quot;stripes,&quot; in proportion to the amount of light they have had and the use made of it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be rewards given to some during that age also; &quot;for whosoever shall give to one of these little ones (of the 'little flock'), a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, shall in no wise lose his reward.&quot; (`Matt. 10:42`).</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.&quot; `1 Pet. 2:9`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.&quot; `Rev. 1:5,6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And hast made us unto our God kings and priests; and we shall reign on the earth.&quot; `Rev. 5:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.&quot; `Rev. 20:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The above scriptures clearly teach that a part, at least, of the Church's work in the future, will be to officiate as the priests of God.  As the work of the priest is one of intercession and of instruction in righteousness, they clearly prove that the glorious work of evangelization will go on after the resurrection has taken place.  The fact that these offices of &quot;king&quot; and &quot;priest&quot; will exist, logically implies that there will be subjects to rule and learners to teach; otherwise the names would be meaningless and the titles an empty sound.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is held by some that the reign of the saints will consist of a very brief &quot;reign of terror,&quot; during which--with Jesus at their head--they will trample their enemies into the dust and utterly destroy them.  We thank our dear Lord for a better hope.  Our work will not be one of destruction, but of salvation.  We shall rule as kings, even with a rod of iron; but the grand object will be to humble the nations, and so fit them for the reception of truth.  &quot;For, when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.&quot; `Isa. 26:9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What a blessed prospect! what a glorious calling!  A royal priesthood!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Who that is imbued with the spirit of the Master; who that has but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tasted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the Lord is gracious, could desire more agreeable employment than to show forth the praises of our Saviour King, to those sitting in darkness? to bind up the broken-hearted? to proclaim liberty to the captive? to give beauty for ashes and the oil of joy for mourning?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;To tell the old, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">old</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> story</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Of Jesus and his love?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To fit us for such an exalted and responsible position we require a peculiar training, and we feel warranted in claiming that the trials, temptations and discipline of this present life are for that very purpose.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Many a struggling believer, trying hard to overcome, buffeted by the enemy, tried by friends, weighed down by hereditary weaknesses in self, discouraged and faint, has cried out, from the depths of a loving heart: &quot;Why, O! why this suffering? why this severe chastisement?&quot; Let us glance for a moment at the pathway trod by the Master--our forerunner--and we shall find the answer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;So, also, Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my son.... Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared: Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered, and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.&quot; `Heb. 5:5-9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;For it became him, for whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  Wherefore, in all things it behooveth him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.&quot; `Heb. 2:10,17-18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;For we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.&quot; `Heb. 4:15,16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The reason, then, that the Church is called on to &quot;fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ&quot; is, that all the body, in like manner to the Head, may be trained to perfect sympathy and to perfect obedience through suffering.  In this present time, we in all our troubles come to our compassionate High Priest with boldness, realizing that he, having been partaker of flesh and blood, can truly feel for us and pity us; so in the age to come, the Church, the promised seed of Abraham, through whom all the families of the earth shall be blessed (compare `Gen. 12:3`; `Gal. 3:14,16,29`,) shall go forth a royal priesthood, according to the order of Melchisedec, fully prepared to sympathize with the nations, to lead them to the paths of righteousness, and to encourage them in the way of life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Shall we shrink, then, from our cross? Shall we seek to put away the bitter cup that is sometimes pressed to our lips? Surely not.  'Tis a loving hand that presents it, 'tis a loving heart (infinitely loving) that sees the need of it.  It is but the Master fitting us for his work; training us for the priesthood; teaching us to rule ourselves that we may know how to rule others; opening our eyes to the weakness of our own flesh, that we may have patience with those over whom we shall be given authority. (`Luke 19:17,19`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Courage, then, my Christian brother or sister, seeking with weary steps to run the narrow way.  Heed not the rugged course; it is all hallowed and sanctified by the blessed feet of the Master.  Count every thorn a flower; every sharp-rock a mile-stone, hurrying you onward to the goal.  Let every advancing step be a &quot;Nearer, my God, to thee:&quot; every hillock in the road an &quot;upward toward heaven.&quot;  Keep your eye fixed on the prize.  Soon--very soon--you may wear the crown.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It is a faithful saying: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">For if we be</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead with him, we shall also live with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him; if we suffer, we shall also reign</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with him.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">           W.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LOVE DEFINED.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;By this shall all men know that ye</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are my disciples, if ye have love one to</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">another.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Love is that tender solicitude and affection with which anything commanding admiration and respect, is regarded. That which is not lovely never can be loved in the true sense of the word.  A degenerated nature may desire and find a morbid satisfaction in that which is unlovely, but that is not love.  Love wherever found is a gleam of the divine likeness, and is spontaneously awakened by the presence of that which is noble and pure and good.  This wonderful principle binds in holiest and most delightful union and harmony all intelligent beings controlled by it.  God is the most glorious exhibition of its nobility and grandeur.  It is the law of his being and shall ultimately be the controlling law of all his universe.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But one inquires, if only that which commands admiration and respect can be truly loved, how could God love sinners and tell us to do the same?  We reply that God never loved sinners </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he loved the jewel he had brought into perfect being because it was truly lovely; and when, under temptation it lost its excellence and glory, his love for its perfection pitied it in its fall, while his justice condemned it; and that love devised the wondrous scheme for its recovery.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us here note the attitude of Jehovah toward those whom he so loved as to give his only begotten Son to redeem them.  For six thousand years he has permitted their adversary to have dominion over them.  Famine and pestilence have stalked abroad; hatred and strife, and war and bloodshed, have filled the earth with untold agony and woe, until the grave closed over generation after generation.  Six thousand years, but no deliverance yet; God still stands off, and still the king of terrors reigns. When the long promised Deliverer comes, it is to rule with a rod of iron-- to dash in pieces as a potter's vessel the kingdoms of earth, which from human standpoint seem necessary for protection against greater evils.  In fear and dismay men look upon God as an enemy, and seek to hide from his presence; yet &quot;God is love,&quot; and</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;He knows, not they, how sweet accord</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Shall grow at length from out this clash</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Of earthly discords, which have jarred</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  But do not know that on His ear,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Breaks harmony--full, deep and clear.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now the love of God is vailed, but soon it shall be revealed in the glorious restoration to Edenic perfection and bliss.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R664 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Soon &quot;the redeemed of the Lord (all mankind) shall return and come with singing unto Zion, (the Church in kingdom power,) and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&quot;  Thus viewing God's dealings, we see that his wisdom often veils his love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">True love while it seeks to shield and protect, will justly judge and endeavor to eradicate a fault--expose it, let the light shine on it and show it up </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to those</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">affected by it,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that it may be removed, and grace and beauty take its place.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A very false notion of love obtains among the majority of Christian people, and under this false notion our adversary endeavors to shield some of the most dangerous and deadly errors that seek to sap the very foundation of the Christian's hope.  Let this deadly thing which the adversary dares to present to God's children be touched by the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God, and he who wields it is said to be uncharitable, loveless.  But does this make it so?  By no means.  Jesus was full of the love of God, but he spoke most emphatically against evil doers:--&quot;Ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel;&quot; &quot;Woe unto you, for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.&quot; (`Matt. 23:13-33`.)  And again he said to erring Peter, &quot;Get thee behind me Satan, (adversary) thou art an offence unto me, for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.&quot; (`Matt. 16:23`.)  But how differently the Lord's rebukes affected his loving disciples and the proud Pharisees.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul was a noble pattern of his Master's spirit in his zeal for the truth, and his care for fellow members of the church.  His usual manner toward all, like that of Jesus, was kind, generous, and affectionate, but did Paul cover the truth, shield error, or fail to warn an erring brother or the flock of God against the encroachments of the enemy?  If he had so done, as an unfaithful steward he would have lost his stewardship.  Though Peter was a noble soldier of the cross and fellow servant in the Lord, Paul withstood him to the face when, by giving way to the old nature for a time, he was to be blamed. (`Gal. 2:11`.)  Note in connection with this, the sympathy and love existing between these brethren; (`2 Pet. 3:15`,) evidently the rebuke was accepted in the spirit of meekness.  And again we find Paul faithfully warning the church against &quot;some&quot; who had become the enemies of the cross of Christ. `Phil. 3:18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Does some one object that we must &quot;judge not that we be not judged?&quot; We reply that to exercise </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> judgment in condemning others would be wrong; but to apply the judgment of God as expressed in his Word is right. We are commanded to do so.  And the various descriptions of evil deeds, false teachings, and seducing doctrines, are given that we may judge--&quot;That the man of God may be thoroughly furnished,&quot; for reproof, for correction of error and instruction in righteousness. (`2 Tim. 3:16-17`.)  It is therefore the duty of every child of God to judge what is right and what is wrong, what is true and what is false.  That against which we are cautioned is judging by other standards than the Word of God --condemning on our own, or any other human authority.  That Paul judged according to God's Word and taught the church to do the same is very clear. (See `1 Cor. 5:3`; `Gal. 2:11`; `1 Thes. 5:21`; `2 Tim. 4:2`; `1 Cor. 6:2,3`. Note also Paul's prayer that love might abound in judgment, `Phil. 1:9,10`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">No doubt Paul's faithfulness in seeking to build up and establish the church in purity of doctrine and life, was often misunderstood, and failed to be appreciated by them.  This is very apparent from `1 Cor. chap 4`.  &quot;But (he says) it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment. He that judgeth me is the Lord.&quot;  Then speaking of his labor and suffering for them, he says: &quot;I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.&quot;  (Read the chapter throughout).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus said: &quot;By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if ye have love one toward another,&quot; and Paul says: &quot;Let love be without dissimulation; abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.&quot;  When contending with an unseen, but wily and powerful foe, what mere hypocrisy is that profession of love which fails to warn of immediate or approaching danger.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The new creature in Christ is a jewel of infinite value, &quot;and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him.&quot; (`1 John 5:1`.) Dearly beloved, &quot;Be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;&quot; &quot;Reprove, rebuke, exhort (each other) with all long suffering and doctrine.&quot;  Give and receive in the spirit of meekness, remembering that &quot;Love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly (unbecomingly) seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">By this mutual love, and this care one for another, will all men be able to discover who are Jesus' disciples--&quot;Let love be without dissimulation; abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.&quot;  So shall you &quot;be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">MAN'S INHERITANCE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When God created man, he endowed him with qualities of being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his own. Qualities of justice and judgment fitted him to be a ruler; qualities of mercy and love prepared him to be a reasonable, kind and wise ruler.  Such is a brief description of earth's first king-- Adam.  An image of his Creator, (not physically, but mentally and morally,) he was invested with authority over earth and its affairs, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as God is ruler over all, as we read: After our likeness let them have dominion over the beast of the field, the fowl of heaven and the fish of the sea. (`Gen. 1:26`.)  Thus was he installed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lord of earth.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He was but another form of creation, a step lower than angels, as lower and under him, came the brute creation.  Accordingly we read: &quot;Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.  Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands.  Thou hast put all things under his feet,&quot; (`Ps. 8:5-6`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All of this glory, honor and rulership was invested in him, to be used in harmony with his nature, which being perfect, was in perfect harmony with the will of God.  This was his inheritance, but he lost it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As God had foreseen, man disobeyed his superior ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords.  This could not be allowed to go unpunished.  He had been informed from the first that disobedience to God would be sin, and that its legitimate punishment and effect is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> While man always was mortal, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> liable to death, if disobedient to God's laws, yet the loving Creator had made every provision necessary to his welfare, in the garden prepared for his trial.  And not only had he arranged that the soul (person) that sinned should die, but also that if obedient the person should continue to live.  The means for life's continuance was in &quot;every tree of the garden,&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the food provided for man's sustenance was amply sufficient to meet all the wastes of his system, and would have preserved the freshness and vigor of his perfect being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forever.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This would be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">everlasting life.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When man became a sinner the penalty </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;death&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must be executed.  It mattered not so far as the penalty was concerned, whether Adam should die the same moment that he disobeyed, or the same year, or a thousand years after. He must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;day&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> used in connection with the penalty, is the general term used now as well as in past times, for a period or epoch of time, as: &quot;The day of temptation in the wilderness --forty years;&quot; the days of creation, etc.  The marginal reading clears up the meaning: &quot;In the day that thou eatest thereof, dying, thou shalt die,&quot; (`Gen. 2:17`.) This was fulfilled not by God's striking Adam dead with a thunderbolt but simply by cutting off his access to the life-giving food supplied by the trees of the prepared garden.  Accordingly an angel drove Adam from the garden and prevented with flaming sword, his access thereafter to the tree (trees or woods) of life, (`Gen. 3:24`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus was the lord of creation driven out into the world which God, foreknowing his fall, had left in an unprepared or &quot;cursed&quot; condition.  The garden which we are told was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;prepared&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was doubtless an illustration of what the whole earth will be when man and his perfect conditions are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restored</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--in &quot;The times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus thrown upon his own resources for obtaining by sweat of face elements to sustain life, Adam found it a hard lot, and by its effects was enabled to know what evil is, and the exceeding bitterness of sin.  And oft, no doubt, he desired, perhaps prayed, that he might be permitted again to dwell in Eden, and promised that with his present knowledge of sin and evil he would more highly prize the good things there enjoyed and more fervently love and obey him &quot;from whom cometh every good and perfect gift.&quot; But though God's plan was no less loving than this, it was broader, wiser and more comprehensive.  God's plan was to let not only Adam, but also </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the entire</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">race,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> learn just this same lesson of the bitterness of sin and disobedience which each must individually learn to fully appreciate. Then bringing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> back to the Eden condition, sin might be forever banished, and the entire race live in harmony with God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Toil and care told in time upon even the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect physical</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> form of a perfect man, resulting finally in his complete overthrow and wresting from his grasp the last shred or spark of life.  He is dead.  After nine hundred and thirty years of struggle with his foe--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- he is conquered.  The penalty of sin was inflicted and continues to this moment, since he still is one of the prisoners in the great charnel house of death, which has since swallowed up the race, and will hold them all until the second Adam, who ransomed the race, and who declares, &quot;I have the keys of hell and death&quot; [hades--the grave] (`Rev. 1:18`) shall take his great power and reign, releasing &quot;the prisoners of the pit&quot; [grave], &quot;the captives&quot; of sin and death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But not only did the casting out from the life-preserving fruits of the garden tend to the impairing of Adam's physical powers, but of his mental qualities also.  It was not possible that he should retain perfect mental vigor, when he became physically impaired, thought being the product of the mental organism made active by the physical vitality.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We see then that Adam's mental powers decreased with his physical deterioration, and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">moral</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> qualities of his mind suffered the most.  While the energy of body and mind were taxed to their utmost to take care of self, it is but reasonable to suppose that the quality of benevolence (love) which, as he was in God's image, must have been one of the ruling characteristics of his being was crowded out, and the qualities of acquisitiveness (selfishness) and combativeness were developed instead.  This same idea followed out would show us that all the higher, grander, nobler qualities were suffered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">measurably</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to decline, while all of the lower ones (common to the lower animals) were the more developed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As man lost the grandeur of his being, and its powers decreased, his rulership over the lower creation, as well as over self gave way, until to-day we find him afraid of all wild beasts, and that they no longer recognize the rulership of their fallen lord.  And the influence once exercised by our father Adam is barely discernible in the occasional man who can master and tame (partially) the ferocious beasts.  Here we have a brief glance at the first dynasty of earth and its overthrow.  Now we see the result: &quot;By sin came death.&quot;  In the expressive language of Paul,</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;DEATH REIGNED&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">King of Terrors under &quot;him that has the power of death, that is, the devil&quot;-- &quot;the prince of this world.&quot;  All bow before him; all are under his control. From the cradle to the tomb, every ache and pain attests his power over us, and the same agency which first placed us under his rule (sin) conspires yet, to more quickly destroy the race.  His rule or reign must continue so long as there is sin to be punished, or until </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the entire</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">race</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is reduced to the condition of lifelessness. But Jehovah foresaw all this, and in his plan has</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A DELIVERER PROVIDED.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Such a ransom and deliverance was a part of God's plan from the first; and we read, &quot;for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil&quot;--sin and death, (`1 John 3:8`.)  And not only so, but also &quot;him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil,&quot; (`Heb. 2:14`,) and thus release from his grasp all of the race.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But as Satan, in exercising the power of death, is the executor of justice, and thus unwittingly serving God's purpose for a time, his destruction is delayed for a season.  The one who would deliver the race from death must first satisfy the claims of the law of God.  This the fallen ones could not do for themselves, as God had from the first foreknown and arranged for in his plan.  Carrying out this plan he had already condemned the entire race on account of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one man's disobedience.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> His purpose from the first being that he would provide another, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who, being without sin, should give himself </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;a ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all&quot; the race-- that &quot;as by one man's disobedience [the] many [all] were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall [the] many [all] be made righteous&quot; (justified from sin and death,) (`Rom. 5:19`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But who is the one righteous, pure, holy, sinless, one?  How could there be such an one among a race </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of whom were condemned?  &quot;There is none righteous, no not one,&quot; the scriptures answer.  But when mankind had learned effectually his own weakness and inability to deliver himself from death, his extremity became God's opportunity, and &quot;God's eye pitied and his arm brought salvation.&quot; The very chief of God's creation higher than angels (`Heb. 1:5-8`,) he who is called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;the beginning of the creation of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rev. 3:14`) is selected as the one who shall undergo the labors of redeeming humanity.  We are not to suppose this was an irksome or unwilling work, for we cannot suppose a being in perfect harmony with Jehovah who would not take delight in doing his will.  Nor would obedience be the only motive which would actuate, partaking as all perfect beings on whatever plane they exist must, of the divine quality--love --he would love to do the work for the sake of its benefits to mankind, in releasing them from death.  This no doubt was a part of &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">joy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> set before him, for which he, &quot;endured the cross despising the shame.&quot; (`Heb. 12:2`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But in addition to this joy at the opportunity to release the human race from death, was that of &quot;bringing many sons to glory,&quot;--some to the lost earthly glory and some to heavenly glory.  To a little flock gave he power to become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sons of God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of a higher than human nature--even to be &quot;partakers of the Divine nature,&quot; and joint heirs with him of his own inheritance.  These, according to God's plan are reckoned as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bride of Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and as such enter the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heavenly family.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  To these sons this mighty one is now the leader or &quot;captain of their salvation.&quot;  He leads them now through suffering, toil and sacrifice even unto death, which is working out for them an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.  Another part of this</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;JOY SET BEFORE HIM,&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">was that he himself should, because of his obedience, labor, sacrifice, etc., be accounted worthy of still higher honor and more intimate relationship and communion with Jehovah than he had ever yet possessed, even to partake of his divine nature.  So we read: &quot;He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wherefore,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name,&quot; (`Phil. 2:8,9`,) &quot;that all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father.&quot; (`John 5:23`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But how shall this redemptive work be accomplished?  We have seen that God's plan was, that since by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> came death, by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should also come the resurrection of the dead. (`1 Cor. 15:21`.) Then to redeem man, this mighty one must become a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in every particular. He must partake of &quot;flesh and blood,&quot; (`Heb. 2:14`,) and consequently must have the exact nature of the fleshly race, but not the sinful and depraved dispositions with which we are now burdened, but he must be a perfect man, standing exactly where Adam stood, except to know more perfectly the exceeding sinfulness of sin and its dire effects which he saw everywhere about him, and also for what purpose he had come.  He took not the nature and form of angels, for that would not have served God's purpose, but he took the nature and form of a man.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All things were now ready.  &quot;In the fullness of time, God sent forth his Son, born of a virgin,&quot; &quot;born not of the will of the flesh but of the will of God&quot;--in a word, as much of a specially creative act on God's part as was the creation of Adam; the difference being that the one could say, &quot;The earth is my mother,&quot; the other was &quot;born of a woman.&quot;  Had he been a descendant of Adam he would have been under the curse of death, as all other members of that race.  He would have been unable to keep the law as other men in whom sinful dispositions and depraved tastes are born.  But while of the same (human) nature he is a new being, distinct from the race.  He is born, grows in wisdom and in stature but manifests powers beyond others because he is perfect, they imperfect.  Now he has reached maturity (according to the law) at thirty years of age.  He knows as no one else does, the great work for which during those thirty years he has been coming--his body preparing--it was &quot;for the suffering of death&quot;--that he &quot;should taste death for every man&quot; --&quot;that through death he might destroy death,&quot; and liberate the dead race--&quot;in due time.&quot;  Now he is come, the second perfect sinless man, and offers his perfect life as a ransom for the race--&quot;Lo, I come, (as) in the volume of the Book it is written of me, to do thy will, O, God.&quot; (`Heb. 10:7`.)  This was his covenant, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to die,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as he afterward expressed it, saying: &quot;For this cause came I into the world.&quot;  And here in type he was buried in the water and rose again, thus making the picture of that which he covenanted to do.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There then, as the perfect one he had done all that he could do, given himself up to die in whatever way the Father might direct.  But though the death had not actually occurred (at baptism) it was so reckoned, (as with us when we covenant,) and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new nature's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> powers and will, which belong to the spiritual body, which he was to be when the work of death was complete; (&quot;raised a spiritual body,&quot;) these powers and qualities were given to him in a measure as soon as the human--earthly--body was consecrated. This was at his baptism when the spirit descended and a voice from heaven acknowledged his begetting again to the spiritual plane, and to the divine nature--&quot;This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.&quot; (`Matt. 3:17`.) Henceforth the life of Jesus is that of a dual being, the outward form being</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R664 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the man Christ Jesus, whose life and being were daily spent for the good of others--a body already given up to death, and a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new being</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> within--the Divine nature--the spirit power of God. And in this he is the pattern and leader of &quot;all who come unto God by him,&quot; &quot;who become partakers of the Divine nature&quot;--the &quot;little flock&quot; called his bride--his body.  We must surrender ourselves to God--be baptised in his death--in order to be begotten of the spirit and receive the earnest of our new spiritual being, the fullness of which will be received when we are completely delivered from this fleshly condition to our spiritual bodies.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thenceforth he &quot;did not his own (human) will&quot; but was &quot;led of the Spirit,&quot; and the actions now were of God, as Jesus testified: &quot;The word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.&quot; (`John 14:24` and `17:8`.)  &quot;The Father that dwelleth in me, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">He doeth the works.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`John 14:10`.) If we as our head &quot;are led by the Spirit of God&quot;--even unto death-- we also become &quot;the sons of God,&quot; (`Rom. 8:14`,) who will also work in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to will and to do of his own good pleasure.&quot; (`Phil. 2:13`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And we who are now </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;new creatures</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (in Christ Jesus&quot;) should take courage from the life of our beloved Master; as Paul says:</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;CONSIDER HIM</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds.&quot;  If you sometimes find it hard to endure the frowns of the world and to be thought of and treated as a deceiver by your friends, think of him weeping in Gethsemane, condemned before Pilate, crucified as a malefactor, forsaken and denied by his loved ones, &quot;yet he opened not his mouth.&quot;  And if human nature sometimes shrinks, although reckoned dead, think of him.  Remember that he was tempted in all points like as we are, (yet without sin,) and can and does sympathize with us, and though you may sometimes cry out, as he did: &quot;Father, if it be possible, let this cup (the ignominy) pass from me,&quot; forget not to add, as he did, &quot;yet not my will but thine be done.&quot; The human will of Jesus though given up at consecration--baptism--felt the crucifixion so that he needed the heavenly &quot;grace to help in time of need&quot; to keep the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> perfectly obedient to the new being--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the divine.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This dying process continued during the three and one-half years of his ministry, from the moment of his consecration and acceptance at baptism, until on the cross he cried: &quot;It is finished.&quot; But what was finished there--the work of atonement?  No, the work of atonement signifies the making </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">at one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of two parties.  In this case God was one and humanity the other party.  Man's sin had brought upon him God's curse, death, instead of his blessing; and by its degrading influence (as we have seen) it had so marred the mental and moral likeness of man to his maker, that he no longer took &quot;delight in the law of God,&quot; but in sin, and it will be readily seen that there was much work necessary to bring about full reconciliation between God and man.  First--Justice must be met, a ransom must be given for the sinner, else God could never, to all eternity, recognize him as having a right to live. Secondly--Man must be brought to his original condition of perfection--in God's image--before he can be of himself perfectly in harmony with God's perfect will and law.  Now, while this work, as a whole, was Jehovah's plan from &quot;before the creation of the world,&quot; its accomplishment only began with Jesus, and will not be completed until the end of the millennial reign, when Jesus shall deliver up all things to the Father, having put down (destroyed) all opposition to God's law. `1 Cor. 15:24-28`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When Jesus cried, &quot;it is finished,&quot; he referred only to the first mentioned part of this work of atonement viz.: The giving of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> this was now complete; the penalty of Adam's sin was now met, for &quot;Christ died for our sins according to the Scripture&quot;-- &quot;He gave himself a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all to be testified in due time.&quot;  He &quot;is a propitiation (satisfaction) for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.&quot; (`1 John 2:2`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Having thus &quot;purchased us from death with his own precious blood,&quot; all the race belongs to him.  A race of sinners they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">were,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> having no right to life; a race of ransomed beings they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> against whom justice has no claim, who may be restored to perfect life at the pleasure or will of Jesus their Redeemer who proclaimed, that in due time &quot;all that are in their graves shall hear the voice of the Son of man and come forth.&quot;  And again: &quot;I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of hell </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[hades</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the grave] and of death.&quot; (`Rev. 1:18`.)  Yes, says Paul: &quot;For this purpose Christ was manifested, [in the flesh] that he might destroy death, and him that has the power of death, that is the devil.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But while we are thus informed of the plan of God to destroy &quot;death,&quot; yet nearly two thousand years have passed since the ransom was paid and still death reigns.  Why does not the purchaser take his &quot;purchased possession&quot;? Ah, he has a grand plan with regard to some of the race he has purchased. He will by trial of faith and patience, develop and separate from the world &quot;a little flock&quot; whom he will associate with himself as his bride.  They will be a peculiar people, zealous of good works, and full of faith, who walk in his footsteps of self-sacrifice and entire giving up of their human nature--will and body--receiving instead the Divine nature --will and body.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the Church, the body of Christ is made perfect through suffering and trials, and united with him [which event we believe to be so close at hand], then the great work and reign of earth's new monarch--the second Adam--begins. Though possessing the power over evil ever since he rose from the grave its victor, yet he has not exercised that power up to the present time, because evil is necessary to the development of his body.  But when we are complete, he shall take to himself his great power and reign. (`Rev. 11:17`.)  This statement is applied as having its fulfillment at the end of the Gospel age during the sounding of the seventh (symbolic) trumpet.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now let us inquire, how long will Christ reign--or exercise authority and rule?  The Scriptures answer, &quot;He shall reign forever and ever,&quot; (`Rev. 11:15`.) that is, being associated with the Father, Christ (and we in him) shall always belong to the reigning and ruling power--Jesus at the Father's right hand (next in authority) and we at his right hand, consequently &quot;above all principalities and powers.&quot;  But in the especial sense of ruling over and subduing earth, the reign is limited to the period of time necessary to the restoring of all earth's people and affairs to a condition of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">at-one-ment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or harmony with God, the Father.  As Paul expresses it:</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;HE MUST REIGN TILL HE HATH PUT</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ALL ENEMIES UNDER HIS FEET.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">last</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> enemy that shall be destroyed is death.&quot;  For &quot;He (the Father) hath put all things under his (Christ's) feet,&quot; but it is evident that the Father did not put himself under the control of Christ. &quot;And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also, himself, be subject unto him (the Father) that put all things under him, that God may be all in all,&quot; (or above all.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Man having been restored to his original dominion, every inferior creature will recognize him as its Lord, and every human being will recognize &quot;Christ as Lord to the Glory of God the Father.&quot; (`Phil. 2:11`.)  And thus will be completed the great work </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">planned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before our creation, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">commenced</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at the baptism of Jesus and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ending</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the close of the Millennial reign. (`Rev. 20:6`,) viz.: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">At-one-ment.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then, &quot;the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the whole earth,&quot; and his &quot;will be done on earth as in heaven.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That this is God's plan, is implied in the term &quot;Restitution,&quot; and is the legitimate conclusion to be drawn from Paul's argument. (`Heb. 2:6-9`.)  He starts out with the original plan of God in creating man perfect--&quot;Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honor and didst set him over the works of thy hands.  Thou hast put all (earthly) things in subjection under his feet.&quot; But as we have seen, sin has marred all this glory and honor, and has degraded us far below angels; taking the dominion out of our hand and permitting death to reign.  And if we look about us we will say with Paul, that it seems as though God's plan was a failure, for though six thousand years have passed, &quot;We see not yet all things put under him&quot; [man].  But is there any hopeful sign to indicate that man may yet be restored to his honor and glory, and set over the earthly works of God's hand? Yes, we have the assurance that ALL </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God's purposes shall be accomplished,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Isa. 14:24`,) and that a &quot;seed of the woman&quot; should yet destroy the serpent --evil--and &quot;bless all the families of the earth.&quot;  And though this work is not yet accomplished, yet we see a beginning of it.  As Paul says, &quot;we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels,&quot; [the condition of a perfect man], for the suffering of death... that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man.&quot;  Thus far had the plan progressed in Paul's day and if he were living now, he would doubtless add, as we can, that the Church, as his body, is about complete; that the Gospel age of suffering </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him and &quot;filling up the measure of the afflictions of Christ which are behind&quot; is ending and the Millennial age in which we shall &quot;live and reign with Christ a thousand years&quot; is dawning.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As those who expect to be of the bride--the body--of Christ and to be glorified together with him, we rejoice to think that the time is so near at hand when we shall be changed, leaving forever the human nature, and being made like unto Christ's glorious body.  But one thing which adds much to our interest and rejoicing, is the thought of the necessity of our development and change, as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the body of the great deliverer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before death can be destroyed and the race liberated, brought to the liberty of the sons of God, as Adam and angels --free from the bondage of corruption --death.  For we know that &quot;they without us shall not be made perfect.&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">We</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must be perfected, on the spiritual plane as divine beings, before </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> can be perfected on the earthly plane as human beings.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Seeing then what high honors and glory await the overcoming sons of God, and the blessings awaiting the world through us, can any one wonder that we long for the happy moment of change? Surely not, and not only we, but the world also, are waiting and hoping [though ignorantly] for a good time coming, for the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now waiting for the manifestation of [the Church] the sons of God, (`Rom. 8:22,19`,) --the sun of righteousness which &quot;arises with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">healing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in his wings&quot; to heal, and perfect, and restore all things to the perfect will of God.  Thus earth will have had when man is restored, the following great over-ruling powers: First, Man under God; Second, Death reigned and him that has the power of death, that is the devil (`Rom. 5:17`; `Heb. 2:14`); Third, Righteousness under Christ; Fourth, The first restored, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man under God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God classes all present governments of earth as Satan's.  &quot;The prince-- ruler--of this world&quot; would not permit any government which would not in a great measure, act in harmony with him, so long as he has the control, which will be until the end of this age, when the Redeemer takes his great power and reigns.  Satan has ruled among the nations for ages, except the one nation, Israel, of which God says: &quot;You only have I known of all the [nations] families of the earth.&quot;  (We have seen that they were used thus as a type of the higher spiritual Israel, the Church, which was to be in the world, but not of it). The time came, however, that God gave over even this nation as the others, when they went into captivity to Babylon, and God's prophet said of the last reigning prince, &quot;Take off the diadem, remove the crown; this shall not [continue to] be the same, I will overturn, overturn, overturn it [the kingdom] until he come whose right it is, and I will give it him&quot; [The Christ]. `Ezek. 21:27`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time, God indicated that the government of earth was given over to the dominion of evil, and pictures it to Nebuchadnezzar as</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A GREAT IMAGE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">illustrative of human power, divided into four parts, Nebuchadnezzar's government representing the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the succeeding, Medo-Persian government represented by the breast and arms; and the belly and thighs representing the third or Grecian government; while the fourth and last part, the legs and feet represent the last phase of earthly government, the Roman Empire, which, in a divided form, still continues, and is to be followed by Messiah's Kingdom--the kingdom of heaven, which &quot;shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[not people],</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and it shall stand forever.&quot; (`Dan. 2:44`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus, as a glorious image, did these earthly kingdoms appear to the natural man; and as glorious they still are regarded by the world.  Extolled in prose and verse, through all generations, are their deeds of blood and violence, which shock the feelings of all possessed of the spirit of love.  Their history is one successive record of crime and death, each of their heroes claiming higher honor than his predecessor because he had butchered greater numbers of his fellow-beings, and made more widows and orphans and more misery.  No wonder that when God pictured the same four earthly governments to the holy prophet Daniel, he gave it as a beastly picture. (`Dan. 7`.)  They are indeed beastly governments.  How perfectly they represent, in their evil and death-dealing power, their master, the devil. The picture, or likeness of the fourth (Roman power) to Satan is so strong that Jesus, when presenting it in symbol in Revelation, almost invariably calls it &quot;the dragon,&quot; &quot;that old serpent, which is the devil and Satan,&quot; etc., thus using the name of its prince as a name for the kingdom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While God thus permits evil to triumph now, seemingly without restraint, and uses it as an agency for punishing sin, yet it is under an over-ruling guidance by which God &quot;causes the wrath of man to praise him, and the remainder he will restrain.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The inventions and arts of the last three centuries (machinery, printing, application of steam, electricity, etc.,) have come about gradually, but we believe are none the less of God--His agencies now in preparation for the blessing of humanity during the coming reign of righteousness. These scientific attainments, which will so fully bless in the future, are even now exercising a powerful effect upon humanity, enlightening the understanding, and, by increasing the dependency of one upon another, they naturally tend to promote sympathy, affection, and fraternity between the various members of the human family.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But all of these blessings, while they serve to lift mankind in a measure out of evil, are only temporary helps.  Satan is still equal to the occasion, and though he could not now induce millions of men to follow for years a leader for his glory's sake, he can foment angry strife between nations upon pretexts of honor, etc., and, though men do not now fight as incessantly as of old, yet the &quot;arts of war&quot; more than keep pace with those of peace, so that to-day the standing armies of earth are far larger and far better prepared for mutual destruction than ever before.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The progress of science and art fails to bring now the blessings which will result in the future, because avarice (selfishness) has crowded out love and benevolence.  Capital and power combine to oppress the poor, and they in turn despise and envy the rich.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor can we wonder if the masses of mankind notice this condition of affairs; and that as knowledge increases among them, they should seek to band themselves together for self-protection, especially if they see, as in Europe, kings, emperors, nobles, and landlords rolling in wealth and luxury, while some of them</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R664 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">barely eke out an existence on the commonest necessaries of life, without luxury or comfort.  All that they can earn more than will purchase meal, potatoes, and salt, with coarse fabric for clothing, is required as tax to support these corrupt governments, which, like great boils, absorb the strength and vitality of humanity. So we see that Satan is still ruling over earth.  He may change his tactics according to the necessities of the hour, but he is ruling still.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God's Word informs us that, by the general uprising of humanity and overthrow of governments, the new age will be introduced.  In the coming struggle the two spiritual powers, Christ and his saints, and Satan and his angels, will each have earthly armies whose causes they will support and advance.  Satan's will be the kings, chief captains, rich men, and mighty men, [`Rev. 19:19`,] while Christ will espouse and bring to victory the cause of the oppressed, who, inspired by a vague sense of justice and right, will be used to some extent as agents to their own liberation from the thraldom of evil and oppression.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How we see the preparation for this time of trouble in the world going on all around us, and how unconsciously each one takes his place to play his part in the closing act of the reign of sin and death!  In this country, less oppressed and in every way more blessed than others,</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CAPITAL AND LABOR</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">are arraying themselves against each other as if against enemies; labor fearing that capital will grind the life out of it unless it organizes and protects itself; capital fearful of losing the upper hand of labor.  Look abroad and see the Nihilists of Russia, the Land Leaguers and Liberals of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Socialists and Communists of Austria, Germany, and France, and tell me, do not all of these things, visible to our natural eye, corroborate what our spiritual eye of faith has seen by the light of the prophetic page--that &quot;the day of the Lord is a day of trouble,&quot; and &quot;distress upon nations&quot;?</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE RESTORATION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The future dynasty of earth, like the present one, will be the ruling of an invisible power through visible agencies of earth.  As now Satan reigns unseen, then &quot;The Christ of God&quot; will reign and rule unseen.  As now sin abounds, so then the opposite--righteousness--will rule.  As Satan now has agents in men and governments, so with Christ's reign, every man coming into harmony with truth and righteousness will be reckoned a servant of God.  The kingdoms of this world being all overthrown, (`Dan. 2:44`,) will be re-established on principles of justice and equity, based upon the golden law of love to God and men.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The chief nation of earth during that age, the Word informs us, will be fleshly Israel, in glory and prominence exalted above all other nations--&quot;The joy of the whole earth.&quot;  And next in positions of favor and blessing will come other nations in proportion as they conform to the law of the kingdom of God.  Thus will the light of truth emanating from the spiritual city--the church--the New Jerusalem, (`Rev. 21`,) bless all nations, and result in healing and blessing all mankind, until ultimately, having put down all opposition, and brought all men to the condition of perfection and righteousness, the third empire will give place to the fourth, which is the first restored, viz.: man over earth its lord and himself in perfect obedience to the King of kings and Lord of lords.  Thus, &quot;God [will be] all in all.&quot;  Amen.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Whosoever in faith prays, &quot;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven,&quot; let him watch for the evidences of the presence of the King and the manifestations of his power.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">====================</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R664 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE ECCLESIA.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a Greek word which is translated church.  It signifies a company, assembly, or body of people bound or compacted together.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To-day there are many organizations claiming to be the church, and having various bonds of union; but we wish to know, upon the authority of God's Word, what </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ekklesia,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body, or church, Jesus established, and what are its bonds of union; secondly, we wish to show that every Christian should belong to that church; thirdly, the injurious effects of joining the wrong </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ekklesia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or church; and fourthly, having joined the right church, what are the results of losing our membership.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">First, then, the church which Jesus began to gather during his ministry, and which was recognized by the Father at Pentecost after their ransom price was paid, was the little company of disciples who had consecrated earthly time, talents and life, a sacrifice to God.  They were organized and bound together as members of one society, and as such had laws and government, and consequently a head or recognized ruling authority. The bonds, were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bonds of love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and common interest.  Since all were enlisted under the captaincy of Jesus, the hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, and aims of one were those of the other; and thus they had a far more perfect union of heart than could possibly be had from a union on the basis of any man-made creed.  Thus their organization was of the Spirit; their law for the government of each was love, and all as a whole were put under obedience to the &quot;law of the Spirit&quot; as it was expressed in the life, actions, and words of their Lord.  Their government was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of him who said, &quot;If ye love me keep my commandments.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus we see the early church organized, governed, and in perfect unity and harmony under the rulership or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">headship</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Jesus.  Contrast this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">church organization</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with what now affects to be a continuance of the same--viz.: the various denominational organizations, each of which binds its members to a mental union on the basis of some creed or dogma of its own (many of them anything but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-ly) and each having its own laws.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These laws emanate from their heads, and rulers or law-givers; so it is clearly seen that these present day churches, have and recognize as heads, or directing, ruling powers over them, the ancient founders of their various creeds, each contradicting the other, while their clergy, in conferences, councils, synods, and presbyteries, variously interpret and enforce the &quot;traditions of the elders&quot; which &quot;make void the Word of God.&quot;  These take the place of the true head of the church--Jesus--and the true teacher and guide into all truth, the Holy Spirit. Hear the prophet Isaiah express it. (`chap. 9:15`.)  &quot;The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ancient</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">honorable,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prophet that</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">teacheth lies, he</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tail.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And the whole nominal system is described in the Revelation as &quot;Babylon&quot;--confusion-- Papal mother and Protestant daughters.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Will they own this to be so?  No, for the lukewarm nominal church of to-day believes herself to be rich and increased with goods, having need of nothing; not knowing that she is wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. (`Rev. 3:17`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These are &quot;hard sayings, who can receive them?&quot;  But these are not our sayings: it is the warning voice of the &quot;sure word of prophecy...whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.&quot;  And it is a loving voice, for again our Lord declares: &quot;As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are two senses in which the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ may be considered: All who, like the early church, were fully consecrated to the doing of our Father's will, amenable only to His will and government, recognizing and obeying none other--these saints, from the beginning of the Gospel Age down to its close, when all of this class are sealed, constitute the &quot;CHURCH OF THE FIRST BORN,&quot; whose names are written in heaven. These are all one in aim, hope, and suffering, and in due time will be joint-heirs with Jesus Christ to the great inheritance --heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised for them that love him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The other sense in which this same class is recognized, is by counting a part for the whole; thus all the living of this class may be spoken of as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> church; or, again, any part of this class of living followers who may meet together may properly be called the church; for, by the word of Jesus we know that wherever two or three are assembled he will be among them, consequently that would be a church meeting--an assembly of the &quot;church of the First Born.&quot;  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">general</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> assembly will be, when all the church are made like, and glorified with, their head--Jesus.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Such, then, is our definition of the church of Christ; it is perfectly illustrated by Paul (`Rom. 12:4,5`) when he compares the church to a human body.  In this figure Jesus represents the head, and all who are his constitute the body, over and through which the head rules.  Jesus has been and always will be the head over his church as a whole; he is likewise the head and ruler of the entire living church, and in every assembly where two or three meet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in his name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he is the head, ruler, and teacher.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Is it asked, in what sense does he teach?  We answer, by exercising the qualities of the head, or teacher; by using one or more of those present as his mouth-pieces in unfolding truth, strengthening faith, encouraging hope, inspiring zeal, etc., just as the head of your body can call upon one member to minister to another. But here a word of caution: If one becomes a useful instrument as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hand,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he should take care that he aspire not to become the head.  Be not puffed up; pride will paralyze and render useless. &quot;Be not ye called Rabbi, (master, teacher,) for one is your master, (head,) even Christ, and all ye are brethren.&quot;  And let not the least member despise his office, &quot;for if all were one member, where were the body?&quot; &quot;Nay, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary&quot;-- &quot;God hath set the members </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of them,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the body </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as it hath pleased</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How simple, beautiful and effectual is God's plan of organization!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This brings us to our second proposition, viz.: that all Christians should be joined to this organization.  In the light of what has just been said as to the class constituting the Church which Jesus organized, it is evident that if you have given up all your will, talent, time, etc., you are recognized by Jesus as a follower, and member of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ekklesia,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or body of which he is the head, whose names are written in heaven.  Thus we join Jesus' Church and have our names recorded as members by consecration. But, says one, must I not join some organization on earth, assent to some creed, and have my name written on earth?  No; remember that Jesus is your pattern and teacher, and neither in his words nor acts will you find any authority for binding yourselves with creeds and traditions of the elders, which all tend to make the word of God of none effect, and bring you under a bondage which will hinder your growth in grace and knowledge, and against which Paul warned you, saying, &quot;Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.&quot; (`Gal. 5:1`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But some say: If it is not proper to unite with any of the present nominal churches, would it not be well to form a visible organization of our own?  Yes, this is what we have--an organization modeled after that of the early church. We think we have come back to primitive simplicity.  The Lord Jesus alone is our head or lawgiver; the Holy Spirit is our interpreter and guide into truth; our names are all written in heaven; we are bound together by love and common interest.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do you inquire--how shall we know one another?  We reply, how could we help knowing one another when the Spirit of our Master is made manifest in word and act and manner and look? Yes, the living faith, the unfeigned love, the long-suffering meekness, the child-like simplicity, coupled with the constancy and zeal of maturity, make manifest the sons of God, and we need no earthly record, for the names of all such are written in the Lamb's book of life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do the sick need visiting or assistance? --these stand ready with consecrated time.  Does the Lord's work require money?--these stand ready with consecrated means.  Does His work bring the reproach of the world, and of a degenerate </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nominal church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- these have also sacrificed reputation-- all--all to God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But again, do you inquire how shall we deal with one who walks disorderly in our midst; if we have no organization such as we see about us, how can we free ourselves from such, as the Lord requires us to do?  We answer, Do just as Jesus and Paul directed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, as in the early church, there are various degrees of advancement among the individual members; and Paul says, (`1 Thes. 5:14`,) some are feeble-minded, comfort them; some are weak, support them; but while you should be patient toward all, you should warn the disorderly, (those who are drifting away from the true spirit of Christ).  Don't mistake the disorderly for the weak, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">them;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor for the feeble-minded, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">support them;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but patiently, lovingly, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">warn</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the disorderly.  Whom does he call disorderly?  Doubtless there are many ways of walking disorderly, but in `2 Thes. 3:11`, he speaks of some who work not at all, but are busy-bodies, these he says should do as he did-- work, that they be not chargeable to any; and if any will not work, neither should he eat.  Thus he said he did, that he might be an example to others. He warns us also against immoral and unjust persons, and those who wrest (twist) the Scriptures, and thus turn the truth of God into a lie.  Then again, `vs. 14`: After you have warned such a one, if he &quot;obey not,...note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.  Yet, count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again Jesus gives explicit directions where there is a matter of offense between two brethren, (`Matt. 18:15,17`): &quot;If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church, (the company of brethren who assemble together,) but if he neglects to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.&quot;  If, under the organization of our Head, we heed his commands, which we will do if we love him, how few will be the misunderstandings and difficulties among the brethren.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This organization has its evangelists, pastors and teachers appointed and directed by the Lord.  They need no laying on of hands by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">so-called</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;Apostolic succession&quot;; for the &quot;Spirit of the Lord&quot; hath anointed all the members of the body &quot;to preach,&quot; (`Isa. 61:1`,) and it is the duty of every member of the body to exercise his office for the edification of the other members.  How complete is the organization of the Church of Christ with its heaven-written, love-bound and Spirit-ruled membership, and how sad the error of mistaking the nominal for the real Church!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The importance of our fourth proposition need not be urged.  It would, indeed, be a dreadful calamity to lose our membership in the true Church or body of Christ.  And no member is out of this danger except when keeping a vigilant watch over the old nature, counted dead, lest it come to life again, and assert itself in the form of pride, selfishness, envy, evil-speaking--or what not? But if </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">filled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with love (the love that prompts to sacrifice) and clothed with humility, and under cover of the redeeming blood, we are safe in the Church (body), having the assurance that it is our &quot;Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, the kingdom is the glorious destiny of the true Church--the &quot;little flock&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> treading the pathway of humiliation and drinking the bitter cup of death.  The glory that shall be revealed in us, doth not yet appear except to the eye of faith, but the temptations and trials are very apparent on every hand.  &quot;Let us, therefore, fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.&quot; (`Heb. 4:1`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus Paul warned others, and thus he</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R664 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">feared, lest (even after) having preached to others, he himself should be a castaway. (`1 Cor. 9:27`.)  We may have our names cast out as evil by those of the nominal Church, and yet &quot;rejoice and be exceeding glad because our names are written in heaven.&quot;  They may frown upon you and despitefully use you and say all manner of evil against you falsely, or they may seek to win you back by flattery, saying they cannot afford to lose your influence-- you could do so much good by remaining among them.  Oh, how necessary in this &quot;evil day&quot; is the faith--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;That bears unmoved the world's dread frown,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Nor heeds its flattering smile;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  That seas of trouble cannot drown,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Nor Satan's arts beguile.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dearly beloved, let us again repeat the warning: &quot;Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not again entangled with the yoke of bondage&quot;--not even in the slightest degree.  Make sure that you are of the Church which alone is recognized in Scripture and cut loose completely from all the Babylon systems which it condemns--&quot;Come out of her my people.&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Half shyly the Church approached the World</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And gave him her hand of snow;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  And the old World grasped it and walked along,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Saying in accents low,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Your dress is too simple to please my taste;</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And diamonds to deck your hair.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  The Church looked down at her plain white robes,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And then at the dazzling World,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  And blushed as she saw his handsome lip</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       With a smile contemptuous curled.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;I will change my dress for a costlier one,&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Then her pure, white garments drifted away,</font><br />

<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Your home is too plain,&quot; said the proud old World,</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Carpets of Brussels and curtains of lace,</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And furniture ever so fine.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  So he built her a costly and beautiful house;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Most splendid it was to behold;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Her sons and her beautiful daughters dwelt there</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Gleaming in purple and gold;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Rich fairs and shows in the halls were held,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And the World and his children were there.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Laughter and music and feasts were heard</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       In the place that was meant for prayer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  There were cushioned pews for the rich and the gay,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       To sit in their pomp and pride;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  But the poor, who were clad in shabby array,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Sat meekly down outside.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;You give too much to the poor,&quot; said the World,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       &quot;Far more than you ought to do;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  If they are in need of shelter and food,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Why need it trouble you?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Go take your money and buy rich robes,</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Buy pearls and jewels and dainty food;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Buy the rarest and costliest wines:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  My children they dote on all these things,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And if you their love would win,</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">  You must do as they do, and walk in the ways</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       That they are walking in.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Then the Church held fast the strings of her purse,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And modestly lowered her head,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  And simpered, &quot;Without doubt you are right, sir,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Henceforth I will do as you've said.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  So the poor were turned from her door in scorn,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And she heard not the orphan's cry;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  But she drew her beautiful robes aside,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       As the widows went weeping by.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Then the sons of the World and sons of the Church</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Walked closely hand and heart,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  And only the Master, who knoweth all,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Could tell the two apart.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Then the Church sat down at her ease and said</font><br />
<br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  The sly World heard, and he laughed in his sleeve,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And mocking said, aside--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;The Church is fallen, the beautiful Church,</font><br />

<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  The angel drew near to the mercy-seat,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And whispered in sighs her name,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Then the loud anthems of rapture were hushed,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And heads were covered with shame.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  And a voice was heard at last by the Church</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">A beautiful landscape might inspire the artist or poet, each in his talent.  Circumstances, audiences, etc., may be said to inspire a public singer or speaker. Murder is sometimes inspired by jealousy, etc., etc.  And the child of God should be so </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inspired</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the teachings of Jesus, the Apostles and Prophets, as to act and teach in harmony with them.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">But let no one forget that these, though proper uses of our English word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inspired,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> yet, when used in Scripture the word has a much deeper significance.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WAITING FOR HIS COMING.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If in this world only we have hope we are of all creatures the most miserable. It is comparatively easy for the few of us who live in comfort, who have been refined by culture and thought till we can see how the shadows of time lend a new intensity and beauty to its lights, and how pain and suffering are a discipline in wisdom and goodness, to think this world a very tolerable one, and to regard human life as a grand, a sacred possession.  But think what life is to the countless myriads of our race; think what the world is, and has been, as a whole.  Remember how in all ages the vast majority of men have been plagued by toil, by care, by fear, by sordid penury; how they have been crushed under the bloody heels of tyrants who were bound to protect them, maimed and tortured, stultified and coerced, by the very priests who were bound to enlighten and emancipate them; how they have been decimated and degraded by war, by famine, by disease, by ignorance and superstition; and who can deny that, if this life be all, then human life taken as a whole, is the most fatal of blunders, of curses the most terrible?  If the tragedy of human life be pregnant with no divine purpose, if there be no better time coming, no golden age of righteousness and peace-- if, in short, we can no longer believe in the advent and reign of Christ, then surely every thoughtful spectator of this vast tragedy must say, &quot;It were better for men that they had never been born!&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But if we believe in this great promise, if we cherish this great hope, then can we with patience wait for it.  And this is the very posture which our Lord enjoins. He would have us to be like servants who watch for the coming of their Lord, that, when he comes, they may open to him immediately.  He would have us believe in, and look for, the advent of a better era, in which all the wrongs will be rectified.  He would have us sustain ourselves under all the toils and sorrows of our individual lot, and under the still heavier oppression of the world's lot, by looking forward to that end and purpose of the Lord God Almighty which will vindicate all the ways in which we have been led, the painful discipline by which we have been tried and purified and refined.  And whosoever holds fast this great hope for himself and for the world at large, he is a true believer in the distinct promise of the New Testament, viz., the second advent of Christ, and may use with sincerity all the words and phrases which it has expressed.--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Expositor.</font></b><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE LORD'S JEWELS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">BY H. GRATTAN GUINNESS.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Christian Church as a witness for God in the world has failed, like the Jewish nation, and become apostate.  There is a little flock, there is a true Church, but its members are scattered abroad and almost invisible in the great Babylon; they are the seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal, they are the called and chosen and faithful who follow the Lamb, they are those who have turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven; they are those who have not the form only, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of godliness, those who keep themselves unspotted from the world, and overcome through faith.  They are found in every section of the professing Church, and the Lord knoweth those that are his--&quot;They shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in the day when I make up my jewels.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But for the rest--for the vast professing body which bears the name of Christ, it has not continued in the goodness of God, it has turned his grace into licentiousness, its sentence is gone forth, it must be &quot;cut off.&quot;  The long suffering of God has been abundantly manifested, it is right that his holy severity should be again revealed.  The professing Church has long been unworthy of the sacred name it bears, and of the high and holy responsibility of being God's witness on earth, which belongs to it; it is time it should cease to hold the position it has so fearfully forfeited.  Instead of being the instrument of spreading the truth of the Gospel among men, it is the worst hindrance to their attaining that knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ whom he has sent, in which life eternal lies.  Like the Pharisees of old it stands as the great obstruction, neither entering itself into the kingdom, nor suffering those who would, to enter in.  The name of God is blasphemed among the nations, by reason of the corruption of the professing church; the light that should have been in it, is become darkness, and great is that darkness!  The church is confounded with the world, and the true saints are strangers in its society; It is no longer the pillar and ground of the truth, it is the hotbed of heresy, false doctrine, and corruption of every kind. What contrast can be more complete, than that between the church as Christ intended it to be, and the church as it now exists in the world!  An end must come to all this!  Not only does the Word of God predict it, not only does our own sense of righteousness demand it, but the solemn analogies of history distinctly intimate it.  Let the undeniable fact that past apostasies brought down the judgment they deserved, forewarn men what must be the end of the existing apostasy of the professing people of God.  Babylon must come in remembrance before God, who will give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath, for her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CONSECRATION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Submission is a strong word, consecration still stronger.  Surrender is cessation of resistance, consecration a transfer of all we are and have to Christ for active service.  It covers person and property, talents and opportunities, and accepts of Christ as leader, manager, friend, and Saviour, present, active, and efficient in all the minutiae of life.  There are degrees of consecration, and even entire consecration is progressive, for new interests, cares, burdens, capacities, and opportunities rise and await disposal, and Christ is revealed in new relations, making new demands, offering new privileges, and these await trustful acceptance, so that ever and anon the proposition to devote all to Christ and receive all of Christ claims fresh attention. Many commit spiritual interests to his care, and worry on alone with temporal concerns; they trust Him to save their souls, but hesitate to ask His aid in business; accept daily grace, but doubt respecting daily bread; rejoice in Christ, as a Saviour, but fail to apprehend Him as a brother, a companion, a present constant friend.  Consecration is not absolutely perfect until the fulness of our Lord is perceived and received, and the fulness of life is devoted to Him, for every revelation of Christ calls for new devotion from us.  The consecration must be as broad as the apprehension, covering the fulness of Christ and fulness of man.--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sel.</font></b><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">WHENEVER I meet with the will of God, I feel that I meet with God; whenever I respect and love the will of God, I feel that I love and respect God; whenever I unite with the will of God, I feel that I unite with God; so that practically and religiously, although I am aware that a difference can be made philosophically, God and the will of God are to me the same.  He who is in perfect harmony with the will of God, is as much in harmony with God himself as it is possible for any being to be.  The very name of God's will fills me with joy.-- </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Madame Guyon.</font></b><br />

He shall thrive and increase most that is busiest in this, which is our traffic with Heaven, and fetches the most precious commodities thence.  He that sets oftenest these ships of desire, that makes the most voyages to that land of spices and pearls, shall be sure to improve his stock most, and have most of heaven upon earth.-- </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sel.</font></b><br />
