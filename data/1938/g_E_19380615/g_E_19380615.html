<p><span class="font9">THIS IS the account of Judge | M 11 Rutherford’s trip to Australia and I J his fight for Jehovah’s kingdom on ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many geographic fronts. The battle</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">was waged against' the enemy in Honolulu, Samoa, Fiji, Auckland, Sydney, and fought all the way back without cessation. Jehovah hailed truths upon the hiding places of entrenched Catholic-Fascists from America to Australia, and their howls went up from Honolulu to the southern tip of New Zealand. The battle was desperately fought by the enemy, but they prevailed not. Through Judge Rutherford the Lord trounced them with such cutting exposures that they were still screaming abuses as the boat left the successive ports of call.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Introduction.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">When a man’s one ambition in life is the honoring of God’s name, he has entered fully into the joy of the Lord; whatever then takes place in his career ean bring only contentment and satisfaction. When Jehovah God revealed to His people that He had put His name upon them, and that they were and are His witnesses, He brought them a joy that will last for eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is God’s will that the majesty of His name should be proclaimed throughout the earth prior to the destruction of &quot;Christendom”, of which Australia is a part. It is His will that Jehovah’s witnesses, of whom and for whom Judge Rutherford is the principal spokesman, should carry that message thither. And it was His will that Judge Rutherford in person should take to Australia the warning from Him that the time of His vengeance and of His deliverance is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Necessarily that message would and did anger the Devil’s representatives in the one continent, in all the earth, that is bounded </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 15, 1638</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">* by the ocean on all sides. Those representatives are, first, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Jurisdiction, and, second, all Jewish and Protestant clergymen, all of whom have participated in the dishonoring of the name of God for centuries and for generations.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Story of the Trip</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">On the 30th of March the S.S. Mariposa sailed from Los Angeles fifteen hours late, bound for Honolulu, Samoa, Fiji, Auckland and Sydney. On board were Judge Rutherford, a secretary, and several companions. Docking at Honolulu on Sunday April 3 the party was met by a group of friends who had assembled. Although they had endured a wait of many hours, they ran forward, with much joy on their faces, throwing leis of perfumed flowers over the head of Judge Rutherford, and then took him and the party to Kingdom Hall, the Watch Tower branch headquarters, in the center of Honolulu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When he told the friends there of the significance of the Memorial of the death of Christ Jesus it was after ten o’clock at night, , due to the boat’s delay. But the hall was packed with Hawaiian, Japanese, and American witnesses, some with sleeping children in their arms, who had waited there most of the day in anticipation of hearing him speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After arrangements for a public talk on the return, departure was made the same night. Just one day later a radiogram was handed to Judge Rutherford disclosing that the Catholic-Fascist group, headed by representatives of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, ■ were desperately striving to prevent him from landing in Australia and that they were conspiring to prevent his use of the Town Hall in Sydney, where the public lecture had been scheduled,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Although howls against the judge had come</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">from the Catholic press of Sydney as early as ten days before, March 24, it was about on the date of this radiogram, April 4, that newspapers of Sydney took up the fight of the Hierarchy; and in their effort to heap calumny on the Lord’s cause and His representative, they donated much unintentional advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When later it was possible, to see the newspapers they showed such scareheads as the following; “Move to Ban Ex-Judge<sup>7</sup> ’ (Sydney </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sun and Guardian, </span><span class="font9">April 3); “May Prevent Rutherford’s Lecture,’’ “Cancellation of Town Hall Date to Be Considered” (</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph,</span><span class="font9"> Sydney); “Ban Use-of Town Hall” (Sydney </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Herald,</span><span class="font9"> April 7) ; “City Council Refusal Commended” (Sydney </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sun,</span><span class="font9"> April 10). Such notices appeared in similar form in all parts of New Zealand and Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few papers had articles on freedom of speech, for which Australia was once well known, and favored permitting Judge Rutherford to speak; but for the most part they spread the abuse which the</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTENTION PLEASE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford, who is travelling on this boat, to Sydney, Australia received from the Sydney DAILY TELEGRAPH the following wireless message:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">At the request of the DAILY TELEGRAPH Judge Rutherford answered by wireless as follows:</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Newspapers Fear the Truth</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">While this battle raged in Aus-trail a, every bit of which publicity was used by the Lord to forward His work and give free advertising - &nbsp;&nbsp;—for the lecture, Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">received a radiogram from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Tele-i graph</span><span class="font9"> of Sydney, which radiogram and the judge’s reply are copied together on a leaflet reproduced on this page. Although the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span><span class="font9"> feared to publish the reply they had requested, and admitted as much, excellent use was made of the leaflet by distributing it to all the passengers aboard ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A late arrival at Suva, capital of the British crown colony, the Fiji Islands, prevented a public lecture there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At Auckland, a town of about 220,000, largest city in New Zealand, several hundred friends were refreshed by a talk on the Memorial, by Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the next day, April 15, while the S.S. Mariposa sailed the Tasman Sea en route to Australia, and still two days from Sydney, there appeared an article in the Sydney </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font9"> stating: “During the trip several Mariposa passengers complained to the purser that they had been rung up and asked to Rutherford’s cabin to hear his teachings explained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This was, of course, an intentional lie, and it is mentioned in this account as one incident of a series which pointed to full co-bp-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">eration between the Catholic purser's' office and the bigots of the same stripe ashore. More than ninety percent of the whole crew and personnel of the Mariposa were said to be Catholic. Later events show how servilely the Mariposa was doing the Hierarchy’s bidding;</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Cowards of a Warless (?) World '</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">Meanwhile the battle continued, throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. Lord Mayor</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION *</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nock, of Sydney, had banned the use of the Sydney Town Hall, as early as April 6. His reason, based upon allegations of the Finance Committee, was that the Anzac [Australian and New Zealand Army Corps] Day celebrations of the returned soldiers of Australia and New Zealand, occurring at the same time as the scheduled speech, April 24, might cause disturbance of the peace ‘because of the soldiers’ animosity’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">t <sup>!</sup> ■ 7 ' <sup>:</sup> That th is was merely an other f al se alarm originated by the Hierarchy, <sup>;</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;and used to hammer any spineless</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">members of the City Council into -line, was clearly demonstrated by a curious incident that occurred at the dock on arrival of Judge Rutherford at Sydney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses were shouting cheers of greetings, one member detached himself from the throng and, concealing his identity, went up to a man wearing a “Catholic Action” button, and asked the Catholic what all these people were doing at the dock. The reply was: “They are down here to see Judge Rutherford. There would be some trouble, and he probably couldn’t have landed, but the returned soldiers fell down on us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The real soldiers repudiated this effort to protect the Hierarchy’s racket by use of their name. Six hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses, many of whom were returned soldiers, demanded a public apology from the Lord Mayor. “Ata meeting of the Katoomba ex-service men objection was taken to the City Council using the name of the ‘diggers’ [ex-service men] as the excuse for canceling the letting of the Town Hall for Judge Rutherford’s lecture.” (Sydney </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Herald,</span><span class="font9"> April 11)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Invaluable Free Publicity</span></h5>

<p><span class="font9">' ground, where Judge Rutherford finally spoke to about 25,000 people [at least six times as many as the Town Hall could accommodate], a.Protest was presented by an ex-service man and was approved by the whole audience, many of whom were ex-servite men. In New Castle (Honeysuckle Iron Works) ex-seryice men passed a similar resolution.' </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(LabourDaily, </span><span class="font9">April 15) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ■ ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 18, 1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At Auckland, New Zealand, where the judge addressed an audience of 4,000 people, a similar resolution was unanimously passed, and it was found by a show of hands that over 80 percent of Jehovah’s witnesses there were returned soldiers. As Judge Rutherford so reasonably pointed out: ‘Why should the returned soldiers be against me? They fought to make the world safe for democracy, and returned to find all nations going under dictators. I have told them this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This fight of the Hierarchy naturally furnished invaluable publicity. Many articles on freedom of speech appeared, and advocates of fair-dealing wired the government and voiced their criticism of the discrimination on all sides. Jehovah’s witnesses had no difficulty, because of the outrageous action of the council, in obtaining 120,000 signers to a petition of Protest. Newspapers took many pictures, gave much front-page space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One news film showed a picture in the theaters in which the judge’s remarks about coming to Australia to tell the people the truth were carried with the film; but his statements regarding the combination of the Nazis and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy were carefully censored. Two good pictures, with very fair captions, appeared in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pix</span><span class="font9"> of April '30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To show the volume of publicity it is here recorded that more than seventy articles, good, indifferent and abusive, appeared in the Sydney papers alone during three weeks of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Similar news items were carried by papers throughout the Commonwealth and New Zealand, aboard ship, over radio, and several articles even appeared in the carefully censored </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times and Herald,</span><span class="font9"> of Fiji Island, where the Catholic Hierarchy’s influence has so far succeeded in sustaining a ban on Watch Tower publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was natural and undoubtedly maneuvered by the Lord that the people of Australia desired to hear for themselves what they read so many conflicting reports about. And they came to the Sydney Sports Grounds, and poured into the stadium 25,000 in number! where Judge Rutherford delivered an epochal speech “Warning”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">pies are quoted to show the vicious endeavor to becloud the issue and blacken the Lord’s cause. A scurrilous article of personal attack on Judge Rutherford appeared in Sydney </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth,</span><span class="font9"> whose editor, on interrogation, refused to admit what his religion is (and can you blame him ?); but other people who know him said he is Catholic. Another representative of Rome, acting as vent for the Catholic Press Sewage System, was appropriately named Rumble. These two got their reward for personal attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Others carried on by innuendo, misinterpretation and lies. The Lord Mayor, as reported in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph,</span><span class="font9"> April </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">14, </span><span class="font9">put locks and guards on the Town Hall and stated to the Press that he hoped no effort would be made to create a disturbance. His attempt to make the public think that violence would be used to obtain the hall was ridiculous in view of the fact that the Sports Grounds, with a capacity of six times that of the Town Hall, was already secured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Telegrams to the Parliament members requesting that the judge be permitted to give his lecture “ Warning” were construed as threats.

<p><span class="font8">Reply: This is a nice country, splendid climate, and some very kind people, and some of the other kind. As to the newspapers, they don’t want to tell the truth. They would not tell the truth if it would suit better to tell a lie. They belong to the same crowd that is trying to deceive the people, because they withhold the truth from the people and publish lies instead. Newspaper editors well know that the Fascists, Nasis and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are in a combine to grab control of the nations of the earth to rule them by dictators. I have made this clear time and again, furnished the facts, which they refuse to publish; and since they refuse to publish these truths, they show they are traitors to their country and to the people, and are delivering them into the hands of the country’s worst enemies. Tell them I said they are traitors and that they have not the courage to tell the truth. You boys will understand I am not saying this to hurt you. You go out and gather up your story, turn it in, and the man that sits back in the swivel ehair blue-peneils it and publishes nothing that is the truth. I do not know what to compare you to. There is nothing that more suits you than that you are a bunch of pimps to a bawdyhouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reporters: Well, we have to make a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer: That may be true, but I would be ashamed to represent such a cowardly, treasonable crowd. I would rather get a tin bill and pick with the chickens than have such a job.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Reporter’s question: Have you some parting message for the Australian people?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">drawing on his imagination when he wrote, April 22, that the judge would speak in the Sydney Domain (the safety-valve publicspeech park, like Hyde Park of London). And April 23 his paper said: &quot;Judge Rutherford arrived in a . . . steelbodied car with bullet-proof windows.” When asked why he made these false statements, he replied: &quot;Well, I had to write something. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The significant feature of these newspaper accounts is that the Australians, a pleasure-loving and liberty - loving people who would have had scant time to hear a religious talk came out in the number of 25,000 to hear the answer to this major newspaper controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The whole effort of the Hierarchy, through their hirelings, the newspapers, resulted in stirring up the people’s curiosity and giving great impetus to the work in Australia and New Zealand. It is a sorry spectacle to see the public press, which is dedicated to tell the people the truth, and by inference bound to supply them with news concerning their welfare, and which admittedly knows that the Hierarchy plans to deprive the people of their liberty and by means of avowed or covert dictatorship subject them to the control of a foreign power, yet, because of fear, refuses to publish the facts.

<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Usurpation of Authority</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">By a usurpation of authority, or rather by a wrongful use of authority, which use of authority was contrary to the Constitution of Australia, the postmaster general refused permission for the use of the land lines (which are under control of the Posts and Telegraph) for the broadcast of Judge Rutherford’s speech “Warning” until he was furnished with a script of the talk. Agreement was made by Judge Rutherford to furnish script for the files </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">but not for CENSORSHIP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. II. P. Brown, postmaster general, or director general of the Posts and Telegraph, took the responsibility before the Lord of refusing to permit the use of the wires, although a public property, unless he could censor God’s message! He preferred to take liberties with the Constitutional rights of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia (for the Constitution expressly forbids interference with free speech or discrimination against any religion), and not incur the anger of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is further evidence that the public officials of Australia have prostituted their office to serving a group whose headquarters are in the foreign country of Italy. The full extent of this betrayal of the people’s trust will be fully realized by the citizens of Australia as a whole only when the Nazi-Catholic Hierarchy begins to purge all protest by execution as in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah from on high laughs at His adversaries. The broadcast of the speech “Warning” was not made, for the reason that Mr. Brown, postmaster general, preferred to serve the Hierarchy, and not keep faith with the people; but a recording was made of the lecture, and the lion est-hearted throughout many lands will, with sound-reproducing machines, hear God’s message contained in the speech “Warning”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Brown’s efforts bring to memory the attempts of-a few New York policemen to stop the operation of sound cars receiving a former broadcast that was at that very time encircling the globe; and of the soldiers who thought, as they stood guard at the tomb, that they might prevent the resurrection of Jesus 1 Opposition to Jehovah can lead to but one thing: “The wicked will he destroy.”—Psalm 145:20.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>25,000 Enthusiasts Assembled</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">At the public lecture April 24, given at Sydney Sports Grounds, upward of 25,000 came clamoring to hear Judge Rutherford give the speech “Warning”. Here the Catholic Hierarchy, in keeping with their practices everywhere, had emboldened a group of Nazis, gangsters, and hoodlums of such ilk, to heckle the speaker, and it is surmised, from the bottles and other weapons that some of these possessed, that their further intention was to turn the gathering into a riot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this they failed, and their uncouth remarks Judge Rutherford answered with such stinging and apt retort that the rest of the audience shouted applause. Perhaps because of fear of the sympathies of the people, these hoodlums finally were almost silent; and their few interruptions gave greater fire to a delivery by the judge that even surpassed his speech “'Safety” in Columbus, Ohio, last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Apparently with the intention of disturbing the speaker, a succession of airplanes flew close to the stand and continued to circle near the field; but the Lord’s spirit was there and Judge Rutherford was at his best, and, unmindful of the racket above, his clear and ringing denunciations fell upon the ears of an enthralled audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Shouts of the hecklers but added vigor to the outpouring of the message and furnished occasion to trim the Devil’s agents. On one occasion, when some ignorant interruption had been made, he turned to the ruffian and said: “If you cannot stop your interruptions I will ask the police to put you out.” Then addressing the audience, he asked, “Do you approve ?” and with a roar they shouted “Yes!” With thunderous vigor he warned of the campaign of the Hierarchy to control the entire world, including Australia, by means of dictatorships, or otherwise called a “totalitarian” government. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The audience shouted applause at the just condemnation of the action of the City Council of Sydney and the postmaster general to prevent the people from learning the truth as contained in God’s Word. Many individual Protestants, some of which are still left in Australia, approved with shouts of “Hear! hear!” when told that unless the people’s interests were guarded by officials who served those interests, and not the Hierarchy’s, Australian freedom would soon be at an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The enthusiasm of an audience of people who love fair-dealing, and had had the principles of freedom of speech inculcated into them since childhood, wildly applauded the speaker, who so boldly warned them of the dangers threatening. More about this later.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Thrilling Climax</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">At the conclusion of the speech, and almost on top of roaring applause, a returned soldier jumped to the microphone, even ahead of the chairman, and proposed the following Resolution, which the chairman read. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. Mr. Chairman, as a returned soldier, who did military service in the British Army for several years, I desire to propose to this vast and representative audience of Australia a resolution. I ask the chairman to read it and move its adoption. . . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Resolved that :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“(1) </span><span class="font9">This body of Christian people, numbering upward of 25,000, assembled this day at Sydney, Australia, do hereby declare that we are in favor of freedom of speech and unhindered worship of Almighty God, which, have been the well recognized principles of this nation since the time of its' birth. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We, </span><span class="font9">heartily join with the 120,000 .persons and more of Australia who recently signed the following protest; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ Attempts are now being made to deprive the people of the Commonwealth of their rights as citizens to hear a 'lecture by Judge Rutherford to be delivered at Sydney Town-Had, April 24, at 4 p.m., and relayed by radio to all parts of the Commonwealth.

<p><span class="font9">“We, the undersigned, emphatically protest against any action being taken by the authorities which savors of Fascism or dictatorship and we petition the Commonwealth Government .to make arrangements immediately for the broadcasting of this speech so that we may hear the Word of God discussed by Judge J. F. Rutherford, an outstanding visitor to our shores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(2) We declare ourselves unalterably opposed to Fascism, Nazism, and religious dictators known as the ‘Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority’, which combine attempts to regiment all people, arbitrarily rule them by dictators, and to deprive them of freedom of thought, speech and of worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“We protest against the action of said unholy combine in their endeavors to induce public officials to prevent the people of this country from hearing Judge Rutherford speak on Bible prophecy. We hold that it is the right of the people to hear what they please and then to exercise freely their own will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(3) We vigorously protest against the action of public officials in refusing the use of public halls where the people might assemble and peaceably listen to the speech of Judge Rutherford. Such officials manifestly have yielded to the seductive influence of the aforementioned politico-religious combine and have thereby deprived the people of this country of their just rights to listen to a public lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(4) We vigorously protest against the action of public officials of the Fiji Islands, and of other possessions of the British Commonwealth of Nations, in preventing the people from obtaining possession of and reading books and other literature dealing solely with Bible prophecy now in course of fulfillment, and which prophecy and facts the people are in great need of hearing and understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(5) Fascists and Nazis, in utter disregard of the right of others, have destroyed the: n at ion of Abyssinia, seized control of Austria, imprisoned thousands of Christian people in Germany, for having in possession the Bible, and are prosecuting rebellious war against the government of Spain, all of which the Roman' Catholic Hierarchy fully endorses; and now that same unholy combine attempts to force dictatorial rule upon all nations, and against all of which we vigorously protest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“(7) We declare that it is man’s inalienable right and privilege to enjoy freedom of thought, speech and worship of Almighty God and that without let or hindrance from any political, religious or other selfish organization, and we call upon public officials to see to it that the people of this country henceforth have and enjoy such full freedom.” It was unanimously adopted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">■ One jack. ass in the au dienee insisted on being heard at the conclusion of the &quot;Resolution. He shouted: “Judge, I want to ask .you some question.” He immediately regretted getting so much attention to himself, as the judge shortly advised him, “Go ask your priest.” Those near-by who heard shouted, with laughter, at this identification of two jackasses at one and the same moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The enthusiasm of the witnesses of Australia, New Zealand, and Malaysia who had assembled in Sydney for the four-day convention, April 22-25 inclusive, was in many ways more inspiring than an American convention, as, for nearly all present, this was their first time ever to see Judge Rutherford. Many of his talks were interjected by frequent expressions of “Hear! hear!”, which meant heartfelt approval. The zeal and activity of the witnesses in this part of the world can be un</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 15,1938 </span><span class="font9">derstood from their obtaining 120,000 names to the petition of Protest in a few days in which many other convention preparations were laid upon them as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Leichhardt Auditorium, where most of the sessions of the convention were held, is situated about halfway between the business center of Sydney and Strathfield (the Australian headquarters of Jehovah’s witnesses), Strathfield being a suburb of Sydney, perhaps six or eight miles distant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At once striking and unique, in the decorations of the auditorium was a gigantic replica of the Calendar of Jehovah’s witnesses for 1938, which was placed as a background behind the speaker’s platform, and which appears in miniature on this page. It was from this dais that Judge Rutherford, in his farewell discourse, on Monday, well-nigh brought the audience to their feet by dramatically turning to the Calendar picture of ‘burning the whore ’, displayed there, and emphasized in this manner the fulfillment of how Jehoshaphat and his band saw Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir annihilate one another.—-2 Chronicles 20.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>A Great Convention</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">The convention, coming as it did, just after Memorial and the end of the “Companions” Testimony Period, found the friends eager to add convention work to an already full month. Truly the spirit of the Lord was greatly Upon those who attended, as, besides a great record in. their field service, Leichhardt Auditorium and the Sports Grounds were manned with ushers, decorators, elean-up squads, and radio experts, and the Sports Grounds were served with the finest of publie-address systems by</span></p><img src="g_E_19380615_files/g_E_19380615-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:553pt;height:687pt;">

<p><span class="font9">placing sound-ear equipment to cover every direction from the speaker’s platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The lecture itself was advertised by billboards, sound ears, placards and leaflets carried to the people to the number of over one million. This involved much extra work for printing and convention office work, as well as their usual duties, for the members of the staff of Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers located at Strathfield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Given many talking points by the volume of newspaper publicity, the friends spread over the country of Sydney and environs with sound cars, portable phonographs (which are now being made in Australia), books, booklets and advertisement. Their experiences were joyful indeed, and indicated that Australians were pretty generally indignant at the perfidy of the newspapers and outrageous action of the city council in banning the talk there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When it was explained that, no doubt, it was the Lord’s will that this ban be permitted in order that larger quarters be obtained, they seemed very glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One lady, who had arranged to board several delegates, declared that, on account of the ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses, both by officials and press, to those to stay at her house she would give breakfast free.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Of all things at the convention, from the time of the ship’s arrival, when an enormous crowd swarmed the dock to meet him, and a sound car broadcast melodious welcome as the ship passed up the harbor, and even the customs officer made special arrangements to courteously rush him through, to the last goodbye, nothing was more significant than the way the Australian friends received Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Americans can get a fair idea of this enthusiasm by reflecting how they would greet the judge if after reading his books containing the good news of the Kingdom for fifteen or twenty years they should see him for the first time. The love for a fellow fighter for the Kingdom, the devotion of one who so fearlessly expressed what they knew to be the truth, the zeal of the true liberty-loving Australian for a righteous cause—all this shone in their eyes, wreathed their faces in loving smiles, and burst forth in cheers that must have caused a trembling in many evil quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There was much oppression in Australia in the early days. Many were exiled there for trifling or trumped-up charges, and thereafter greatly abused, and the memory of this early beginning undoubtedly still lives in their minds; and the spirit of the pioneer still remains among a portion of the people of this antipodean commonwealth; a spirit that has about disappeared in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In all, the judge gave three lectures in Australia besides “Warning”. The hearers were refreshed and exhilarated by an explanation of the relation of the children to God’s organization and by being given a fine understanding of the David-and-Goliath picture and the dramatic episode of King Jehoshaphat’s deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To watch the friends devour the spiritual food which the Lord so graciously provided was almost like seeing them having their eyes completely opened for the first time to the full grandeur of Jehovah’s Word. So, when the time came for departure tears glistened in many eyes.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">On the voyage home the same animosity to our party was observed among both passengers and officers of the ship. Copies of the Resolution passed at Sydney were distributed among the passengers and many of the crew. It will be noted that paragraph 6 specifically refers to the Catholic activities on board ship, which offenses, namely, the celebration'of mass and communion, had continued throughout the voyage. The ship generally was pretty hot again after this resolution was circulated. Their retaliations need not be mentioned, but it is sufficient that, as far as Jehovah’s witnesses aboard were concerned, they had discharged their responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The public meeting at Auckland has been mentioned. On the platform, behind the speaker, were fifteen fine-looking returned soldiers. Immediately following the delivery of “Warning” (which 4,000 people, almost every one of whom was of Scotch, English or Irish descent, applauded with clapping and. shouts of “Hear! hear!”), a Resolution similar to that at Sydney was unanimously passed with a mighty “Aye”. In view of the fact that this meeting was held at noon, this was a remarkably large audience. Later, on the same day, Judge Rutherford addressed a meeting of about 1,000 witnesses, and 'sailed for Fiji.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is difficult to describe how constantly the enemy beset Judge Rutherford throughout the journey. Besides annoying disturbances maneuvered by the ship personnel, he was followed by a Fijian police officer, both on shore and aboard ship, while the vessel was in the harbor at Suva. Considering that the ship was ‘American soil’, this foreign espionage was galling in the extreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There seems more than a suspicion that the ship’s officers had some part in the cancellation of the Town Hall in Suva,- which had been rented for a public lecture; one of the officers at the purser’s desk was seen pointing out a member of the party to the Fijian police, and admitted as much on questioning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The property of another member of the party was held in custody in the customs office, while the official there held conference with a priest; such ill-treatment of Americans was protested in a letter to the governor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the return voyage considerable literature was placed among the natives and in the Naval hospital at the American Naval Base, Pago-Pago, Samoan Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now having been at sea for nearly six weeks, with only a little while ashore, the party arrived in Honolulu. After a public talk by Judge Rutherford there, and arrangements for conventions at Hilo and other points, the party embarked for America. With much rejoicing they landed in Los Angeles, after two months of constant strain of hattie, and thanked Jehovah for their safekeeping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Though bearing responsibilities such as no other man has borne since Jesus was on earth, and looking after the details of a world-wide organization with a care and consideration that could come only from solemn appreciation of the fact that the work is God’s, and that man at his best can only be a servant of the Creator, Judge Rutherford planned more than six months ago to visit Australia and tell the people of good will who might assembled in Sydney what he had found in the Word of God, of greatest importance to them. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font9">trip is long, expensive and tiresome.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>A Great Honor to Australia</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">Judge Rutherford had no misconceptions that the Devil or any of the Devil’s crowd would be glad to see him come. He knew, and his friends knew, that he has been and is too faithful to his trust to obtain any such reception anywhere. But Judge Rutherford is held in honor by the Most High God, Mid by </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 15, 1938 </span><span class="font9">millions of his fellow men, and it is customary in civilized lands for all to give ear to such, Australia had such an honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But Australia today is in bad condition. Not long ago there was a pagan celebration in Sydney styled a “Eucharistic Congress”. It consisted of alleged followers of the alleged first pope, Peter, who warned all Christian teachers to feed the flock of God “not for filthy lucre, . , . neither as being lords over God’s heritage”. (1 Peter 5:2,3) Needless to say Peter never was a pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The account says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Sydney, Australia, in 1023, the host was escorted for seven miles across the shining waters of Sydney harbor by ships emblazoned in silver and gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Judge Rutherford arrived in Sydney he was not accompanied by “ships emblazoned in silver and gold” which paraded “for seven miles across the shining waters of Sydney harbor”, and would not have wanted it (would rather have rebuked it), but was met by fully a thousand earnest Christian men and women, glad to see his smiling, earnest, honest, courageous face, and to welcome him in the name of the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those that came in Peter’s name were dressed in lace curtains and lingerie, hating the Holy Scriptures and defaming and dishonoring Jehovah God by their every word and act. Their alleged errand was to parade around with a little piece of bread, honor it, do obeisance to it, and glorify it; their real errand was to glorify themselves and promote their racket, the Roman Catholic religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When these impostors came to Sydney the Devil’s crowd fell prostrate before them. They were willing to kiss any part of their anatomy, and could and did manifest their servility by falling on their knees and kissing their rings. From pictures published in the papers of the time one could well imagine the whole thing as taking place in the days of Nimrod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Judge Rutherford wanted none of that; would have despised it; would not have accepted it under any consideration. All he wanted was an opportunity to tell the good people of Australia some of the purposes of God, that they may set their houses in order while yet there is time. The Devil’s crowd tried to prevent that achievement, and they got left in the lurch, as they always do, because they leave God out of their calculations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">R</span><span class="font11">ULE of the people by fanatical dictators is now the great peril threatening all nations. Fascists, Nazis and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have combined to force such dictatorial rule upon the world. The Hierarchy has become entirely a political organization and what is called “Catholic action&quot; is a well-organized movement’to gain control of the various governments of earth. When that does take place? all the liberties of the people will be taken away and all Protestants and Christians will be cruelly subjected to the old-time Catholic Inquisition and torture. By employing subtle, coercive methods of operation the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies are gaining undue advantage over many business companies, which companies are induced to co-operate in destroying the liberties of the people. Judge Rutherford, who travels in various parts of the earth, has carefully observed some of their methods. Recently, while on a voyage to Australia and return, he observed such practices used in discrimination against other passengers and he addressed to the president of one of the steamship companies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">May 10th, 1938. Mr. Wm. Rolf, President, Matson Lines;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">215 Market St.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">San Francisco, California,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is a friendly suggestion. Having made the voyage from Los Angeles to Australia and return on the Mariposa I express my appreciation of the material comforts it furnishes. I thought to render some assistance to your company but I am of the opinion that officers of the ship did not appreciate my purpose, hence I am writing to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each day-on the outgoing journey two Catholic priests operated in first class and one or two in the cabin class. On the return one priest operated in the cabin class. Each day there appeared in the ship’s newspaper a notice such as hereto attached. This to the exclusion of all other faiths or beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am certain that steamship companies in America, including yours, are being imposed upon by religious practitioners and that to your injury. The religious belief of every person is a matter of personal choice, which no one ean properly interfere with, nor should the practices of any religious belief be imposed upon the traveling public. It seems it is wholly uncalled for to daily put under the passenger’s nose a notice of what the Catholic priest is doing. At the same time I am informed that literature of other religious organizations, brought aboard to be distributed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">12</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">has been deliberately cast overboard by officers of this ship.-Such a flagrant discrimination caused me to make some inquiry, and I learn that the stewards are not permitted to attend any religious service except the Catholic. I am also informed that the priests go amongst the stewards and stir up their prejudices against others who are not Catholic. If their operations were carried on in a private room, without advertising their activities, then there would be no discrimination such as now indulged in by the steamship companies, including yours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am certain from the facts I have in my possession, and which facts are easily ascertainable by everyone who tries, that the “Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority”, operating from Vatican City, Rome, is putting forth a studied campaign of Catholic action and is operating in conjunction with Fascists and the Nazis to gain control of the official affairs of the world. The hypocrisy of the matter is this, that these priests travel on the ships and pretend to be serving God when in fact they are agents of what is generally advertised as “Catholic action” and which action is entirely for political purposes. It would seem that the Hierarchy has an understanding with steamship companies to carry on their practices on all the ships that ply the seas, and which practices are working real and great injury to the steamship companies, and in course of time even greater injury will result from their activities.</span></p>

The venerable gentleman declares it orenly!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Now let us analyse the prose of &quot;Father&quot; O'Brien and see just what his hierarchy expects to do in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He says that &quot;all loyal dilldrai of the Catholic Church are to assist our 'worthy President* with nil their strength to see that the individual comprising the United States Supreme Court shall obey the Prebident's injunction* and if ne* </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">effaqa</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ry will change, amend or blot out the present Constitution so that the President may enforce his or rather oar humanitarian Program on all phases of human rights as laid down by our Saintly Popes of the Holy Mother Church.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Evidently &quot;our worthy President” is doing the very thing which &quot;Father&quot; O' Brien advocates in changing or blut out the Constitu-' tioa of the United States, begin*, ning with the Supreme Court. W«; •wonder just how much pressure Jim Farley ia exercising upon the President to enable, the Roman: Hierarchy to blot out of existence the Constitution of America. In regards to the &quot;Saintly Papes&quot; that the Roman Church, has .had we ajl, know that, quite many of theml</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Seeing .the subtle method? employed by Fascists and the Hierarchy to run rough-shod over inoffensive people, an assembly of 25,000 Australian citizens at Sydney adopted a Resolution, copy of which is herewith enclosed. A like Resolution was recently unanimously adopted by approximately 4,000 people assembled at Auckland, New Zealand. The people are being informed of the crooked methods of the Roman Catiiolic Hierarchy and Fascists and I opine that they will call attention to the matter in no uncertain terms from now on. There are millions of honest and sincere persons amongst the “Catholic population” and, of course, what is said here is no reflection on them, but they, together with others, are being deceived by the political, deceptive and underground methods employed by the “Hierarchy of Authority”. Steamship companies of America, as well as others, should awaken to the danger now threatening the institutions of the earth. Fascism is growing rapidly in America and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is doing more to increase Fascism than any other thing in America. If that, radical organization, together with the Hierarchy, continues to push their schemes unhindered, America will soon be in as bad or even worse condition than Germany and Italy, and the financial institutions, as well as the political, will go to the pot. It is unbelievable that business men, such as operate your company, wish to be even indirectly made a party to a nefarious scheme carried on under the cloak of religion, but which, in truth and in fact, is political, the purpose of which is to deprive the people of America of their liberties and to rule the nation by a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why should steamship companies find it necessary to constantly carry Catholic priests, the agents of the Hierarchy and Fascists, and advertise them daily in their papers, and at the same time ignore every other faith or belief? I am convinced that the Hierarchy has obtained undue advantage of business men by some methods and which that organization employs with greater effect than any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The officers and many of the crew of the Mariposa seem to be under the dominating control of the Hierarchy, and which catlses them to discriminate against non-Catholic people who travel upon the ships. Your duty as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font9">American citizen is to see to it that no for</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">eign, </span><span class="font9">political power or agitators, such as Fascists and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are permitted to use the facilities of your company to destroy the liberties enjoyed by Americans. You cannot afford to let this practice on your ships continue without giving it due and proper consideration, and I am sure upon a fair investigation, if you regard your duty properly towards a traveling public, you will cease to force the Hierarchy’s practices upon others who use your ships. Doubtless you have not even stopped to consider that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, by causing its agents, namely, the Catholic priests, to travel continuously on the boats, is for the very purpose of furthering their political schemes. You surely would not wish to jeopardize your own business interests. Above all this, their operations are dishonoring Almighty God, although they pretend to be representing Him and the Lord Jesus Christ, and under that cloak carry on their political activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your ships furnish splendid traveling conditions for the public and should be enjoyed by all without discrimination against any. And believing that you are unaware of such discrimination I am taking this occasion to call your attention to it, understanding that a friendly criticism is always desirable. I am certain if some one was regularly carrying on a gambling game upon your ships that you would stop it quickly. The practice of the Hierarchy’s representatives on the ships is far worse than gambling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">May I suggest, therefore, that your ships put in practice rules that represent equality toward all and partiality toward none.

<h6><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>. Ratti Rules the Waves</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The old adage “Britannia rules the waves” now gives way to “Ratti rules the waves”. Here is a beautifully gotten-up folder of the Hamburg-American Line-North German Lloyd, boosting the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and explaining how easy it is to be on the side of the pope and on the side, of Hitler at one and the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The booklet contains nine full-page pictures of Roman Catholic “altars” as furnished for travelers on the Europa, Bremen, Hamburg, Deutschland, Hansa, Columbus, Berlin, New York, and St. Louis, and carefully refrains from mentioning Protestantism in any way, because between Ratti and Hitler Protestantism in Germany is dead as a doer nail. Vestments and all other requisites for the dishonoring of God’s name are provided; there are crucifixes on board which may be placed in the state rooms. “Altar” linens, “hosts,” wine, candles, incense and “holy oil” are supplied by Roman Catholic priests at Hamburg, Bremen and New York; the ships carry Roman Catholic organists and sacristans; the ship management looks out for the Roman Catholic days of “Fasting” and “Abstinence”, and everything is done as Mr. Ratti and Mr. Hitler would wish. It is a good piece of advertising, 12 pages in three colors. The silver cross on the outside front cover is surrounded with a very effective purple haze. The title of the-booklet is “Ship’s Altars”, and definitely marks the pope’s taking control of the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Newspapers that never willingly publish a truthful or favorable statement about the extensive work done by Jehovah’s witnesses devote one or more columns to inanities of chapels, “altars,” vestments, chasubles, burses and other religious junk that is supposed to be necessary in “ministering to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">spiritual </span><span class="font9">needs of passengers ’ ’. Such columns of drivel</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">16</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">are generally found in close proximity to the pages devoted to advertisements of steamship lines, and thus assist in giving publicity to the steamship companies that in turn give publicity and support to the religious racket.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Not a Ship in Fifteen Years</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ During the World War the United State? was cajoled and coerced into building hundreds of vessels of a type that would never be of the least use except to take soldiers and supplies to France. As a consequence, when the so-called “American merchant marine” was reconstituted it was one grand fiasco. Now the president wants to reconstitute it some more, pointing out that last year, except for oil tankers, there was not a single sea-going vessel of the passenger, combination or general cargo-carrying type under construction in an American shipyard and not a single seagoing ship of the general cargo-carrying type had been built in America in fifteen years.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Automatic SOS Signals</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ AH cargo vessels will now be fitted with automatic SOS signaling apparatus, which will work while the ship’s radio operator is sleeping. As soon as some ship in distress sends forth its signal, the automatic devices on all the ships within reach will immediately begin ringing bells and dashing lights until the ship's management does something about it.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>The Inside Passage to Alaska</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The inside passage from Seattle, Washington, to Skagway, Alaska, over a thousand miles, is as land-locked as a canal and might easily be mistaken for a large river. Snowcapped mountains rise from the water’s edge on each side: there are hundreds of islands. There are but two comparable inside passages in all the world; one along the shores of Norway, and one along the shores of Chile.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>“Fascism”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T</span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">otalitarianism</span><span class="font9"> is a government wherein all powers are centered in one dictator. Communism, Fascism and Nazism are all of one and the same kind, but appearing under different names. Russia, Italy, Germany and other European countries are thus ruled by dictators. The purpose of totalitarianism is to regiment the people and put the state forward as supreme over and above Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The facts show that in those dictatorial governments the freedom to worship Almighty God is denied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Religion, commerce and politics are combined or formed into a conspiracy to establish such dictatorial rule in all parts of the world. The London </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font9"> recently published a map showing that almost all of Europe has fallen away to totalitarianism and is therefore ruled by selfish dictators. The British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America are next in line, and the purpose is to rule these countries by dictators. The religious wing of -the confederacy is led by the Vatican at Rome, and almost ail religionists, being ignorant or blind to the real purpose, have fallen under the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and are supporting the totalitarian movement. The “Catholic Action” movement in America has for its sole purpose the control of the American people and government, and to that end that ultrareligious organization brings into its fold leading financiers and politicians of America. Note the following, both bearing the same date, showing that politicians and financiers are being flattered by the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Vatican City, JIarch 8. A Vatican City news service today announced that Pope Pius had made J. P. Morgan and Thomas W. Lamont, of the Morgan banking house, knights of St. Gregory the Great.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Washington, March 8, The apostolic delegation disclosed today that Alfred E. Smith </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 15, 1*38 </span><span class="font9">has been elevated by Pope Pius XI to tljie rank of papal chamberlain of the &lt;_j.pe and sword, A Catholic spokesman said the honor made Smith, 1928 Democratic presidential nominee, a member of the pope’s personal household. The honor was conferred on Smith for ‘outstanding service’ as a Catholic layman.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer,</span><span class="font9"> page 13, appears the following: ‘ ‘ Does the Church intend, should the power be hers, to change and modify the Constitution ? Does she mean to discard the American principle of the separation of Church and State? In fine, does she aim at being the established church of the United States? One cannot doubt, in view of the present Pope’s teaching, which indeed is simply the reiteration of age-old Catholic doctrine, that the answers should all be in the affirmative, ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some men in America, high in the political affairs, see the danger of Fascism, or totalitarianism, and among such is Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of the Interior. In a public address of February last Mr. Ickes said: “Totalitarianism, either of the right or of the left, is alien to the spirit that dominates the Englishspeaking democracies of the world. ’ ’ He said: “Totalitarianism is subversive of the ideals upon which our democracies are founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Those of us who continue to believe that it is better to be governed even badly by ourselves than to be well governed ]oy others, must be increasingly alert, especially against insidious Fascism. It seems to be that Fascism constitutes the greatest threat in the world today,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To my way of thinking, Fascism is a retrograde movement. It means a turning back of the hands of the clock. It means that liberty to live one’s life, with only sueh restrictions a:', are necessary in order to assure the equal liberty of others, must be surrendered to a dictatorial power which will think and act for all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fascism is the final scheme of the Devil to turn all men away from Jehovah God and plunge them into destruction. Do the Scriptures foretell the formation of this combination and what will be the end thereof?

<p><span class="font9">IT IS written: “All their works they do for to be seen of men, . , , and love ... to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. * ’—Matthew 23:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus spake Jesus of Nazareth</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">concerning the religious roosters of His day. They believed in self-praise. They delighted to have prominent positions at all public affairs, and they let it be known to all people far and near that they should be called &quot;Rabbi, Rabbi”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So it is today. The clergy have adopted and acquired for themselves a string of titles. They love to be called “Reverend”, “Right Reverend,” “Most Reverend,” “Eminence,” “Holiness,” etc., etc., etc. They resent being called “Mister” like the ordinary male person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font9"> here presents a few instances of the inordinate vanity and desire for praise by these professional religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us go first to the municipal court of the Town of Cheektowaga, a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y. The case against one of Jehovah’s witnesses (Joseph Banasik) is being tried. Paul C. Hoffman, minister of the Reformed Lutheran Church, has been subpoenaed as a witness for the defendant. The defense attorney calls: “Is Mr. Hoffman in court?” A black-garbed person &quot;rises from his seat in the front of the courtroom and speaks: “I don’t know whether I’m the person you want; my name is Reverend Paul C. Hoffman.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As “Exhibit 2”, the case of Mr. H. E. Peters is presented. This pastor of the Universal ist Church in Floral Park, N. Y., was subpoenaed as an expert witness for the defense in the ease of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The People of the State of New York</span><span class="font9"> against </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">William E. Johnson, </span><span class="font9">one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The defense attorney asks, “Is Mr. Peters in court?” Again a black-garbed person rises from his seat in the courtroom and walks to the witness chair and, in response to the attorney’s question, states: “My name is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reverend</span><span class="font9"> H. E. Peters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And now, in the same Floral Park ease, comes “Exhibit No. 3” in the 'gracious’ person of the black-garbed John P. Skelly, assistant pastor of the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Victory, Floral Park. Following is an excerpt from the record of his testimony, answering questions propounded by the defendant’s attorney;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">18</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Q. Your name and address?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“A. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reverend</span><span class="font9"> John P. Skelly, 2 Laurel Parkway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Q. What is your occupation, Mr. Skelly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“A. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Father</span><span class="font9"> Skelly—(addressing the Court) Judge, may I have my title?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Q. How would it be if we call you doctor? “A. No, sir, my title is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Q. You don’t want to be called Mister? “A. No, sir—. Judge, may I have my title? “Q. You are, of course, not my father— “The Court (interrupting) : lu the courts we cannot recognize titles. That privilege will have to be foregone. This lawyer may have some religious scruples and he is entitled to take the position that he is taking for religious reasons. Under the Constitution we cannot compel him to subscribe to any particular kind of religion. It is not necessary to address the witness in any way; just ask him questions. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How true it is, as Jesus said, that these self-designated “reverend” gentlemen are concerned entirely with their own importance and exaltation. Pathetically and infantilely they cry out, demanding praise and laudation of fellow human creatures. Although addressed by fellow humans with ordinary and common respect and courtesy, they are unsatisfied, w-a-n-t more, and childishly wail: “Judge, may I have my title?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But when it comes to ‘crying aloud’ (Isaiah 58:1) in the public interest; or ‘barking’, after the manner of the faithful watchdog, to warn of approaching danger that men of good will may properly meet the situation (Ezekiel 3:17-21), these lovers of titles are silent as the tomb, dumb, even as such “Dee-Deeze” are aptly portrayed in Holy Writ at Isaiah 56:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Alas! Alaek! And, forsooth I It’s just the echo; “Judge, may I have my title?”</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>A Contrast</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">An Italian Christian, Daniele Battisti, writing in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">II Testimonio,</span><span class="font9"> sets forth the differences between the Last Supper and the mass in Catholic churches. The Supper was eaten in a house. In the primitive church this was ordinarily so. (Acts 2:46; Romans 16: 5; 1 Corinthians 16:19) The priest, when saying mass, requires a temple, imitating pagan usage. In the beginning of the fourth century Pope Sylvester introduced the consecration of churches and altars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus reclined at the Supper. The priest stands at mass. Jesus reclined at a table. The priest stands before an altar. Jesus took the meal with others; the priest, alone. The Last Supper was in the evening; mass, in the morning. Jesus wore his usual clothing. The priest is sumptuously arrayed. Jesus took the bread and wine after the meal. The priest eats fasting. Jesus used the ordinary unleavened bread; the priest, the host.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the church of Byzantium the host was a round cake; in the Syriac church also. Roman, Coptic, Abyssinian, Nestorian and Marovite churches used similar oblations. According to passages in Livy, Suetonius, and Cicero, the pagans often sacrificed (in addition to annual sacrifices) little circular cakes to obtain forgiveness of sins. This was made of fresh flour and was called “ostia”, or the host. Cicero, in Chapter 3 of De </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Natura Deorum,</span><span class="font9"> says the priests believed that in eating the ostia they were feeding on thedlesh and blood of their gods. “Whoever founxl a race of men so little intelligent, ’ ’ he continues, * ‘ as those who think that which they eat can be their gods?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus took wine at the Supper; the priest, wine mixed with water. Jesus spoke out loud; the priest, softly, so that certain passages in the mass are called ‘ ‘ Secretae ’ ’. Jesus spoke; the priest reads. Jesus’ words were in the vernacular; the priest’s, in a little-understood tongue. Jesus did not move about; the priest ‘ at mass is so mobile that scarcely a member is still. Jesus never signed the cross; the priest crosses himself a thousand times as if assaulted by a legion of devils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus offered the bread and the wine to the apostles. The priest, feigning to offer it to God, consumes it himself. Jesus faced His disciples at the Supper. At mass, the priest turns his back on the congregation.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>A Defense of the Inquisition</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ On account of its claim to perfection the Roman Catholic organization would inevitably defend its Inquisition practices. It will be of interest to some to observe the language in which this is done, taken from a Catholic school history, Afodern </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">World,</span><span class="font9"> section 325, pages 345 and 346:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is evident that something like the Inquisition is a necessity for the Church, unless she is to neglect utterly her duty of preserving unchanged the teachings of Christ. In fact every “religion must, by some board or committee or assembly, or by some individual officer, or by the general vigilance of the members, watch over the integrity of the body of doctrines to which it has decided to adhere. And as soon as an actual case turns up, the transaction will of itself assume the nature of court functions. Some spiritual or temporal penalty, too, must be inflicted, if the whole proceeding is not to be an empty farce. It is therefore only natural that in the course of time the Church came to organize a regular “Tribunal of Faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The peculiar shape,</span><span class="font8"> however, which this tribunal took is due to the nature of the times. “The political and social development of the Christian world,” says a non-Catholic historian, “led with almost automatic precision to the establishment of . the Inquisition,” It was the product of its age, . . ,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(1)</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> The accused never found out</span><span class="font8"> the names of those who either had reported him or had given evidence against him. But those who prescribed this method knew it would appear incongruous. They considered it necessary to take away all risk for such as might feel bound to give information . . .</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">(3)</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> The prisons of the Inquisition</span><span class="font8"> were as a rale much better and perhaps in no case as bad as wpre those dens in which criminals were detained by secular potentates.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>One Priest to Every 45 Converts</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ In the year 1936 the Roman Catholic ' church of the United States and its possessions obtained a total of 62,062 converts. They added 1,399 priests, making one priest for each 45 new converts. Births increased the “Catholic population” by 374,019 more. The Catholic population of the archdiocese of New York showed a decrease of 50,000. The Hierarchy constantly boasts of the millions of Catholics, but the whole institution is a hollow fraud, because built upon lies. In Armageddon it will disappear like a snowflake.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The “Reverend” Charles E. Jaynes, Jr., the seven-year-old “evangelist” who has been making such a fool out of New England people that on one occasion 15,000 persons eame out to hear him at Boston, lectured to 150 persons in blase Brooklyn and made no hit whatever. It is admitted that his mother wrote his “Heaven and Heil” sermon, and probably all the others, and that young Charles merely committed the same to memory. When he slips, his mother prompts him. The whole thing is a swindle, and a work of the Devil. The boy has a gift of gab, an A-l bluff, and a good memory, and that is all. Boston was intelligent, once.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Objects to Bullying</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ If meat were served on Friday at a school lunch and a child refused it for religious reasons, nobody would think of objecting. If leavened bread were served at that lunch on the Feast of the Passover and a child refused to eat it, on religious grounds, nobody would think of objecting. But if a child who belongs, not to a large religious group, but to a very* small sect known as Jehovah’s witnesses, refuses on religious grounds to join in the flagsalute exercise, people not only object—they *expel him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That such a law exists in Massachusetts, of all places, shows that it not only can but has happened here. This commonwealth was founded amid incredible hardships by a handful of small townspeople seeking religious freedom. Most of our citizenship today is derived from persecuted minorities of one kind or another seeking that freedom of worship as their conscience told them, which is guaranteed to them under both our state and federal constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To protect this sacred right the Massachusetts Civic League has introduced a bill—Senate 315—which would enable school committees to exempt from the flag-salute children whose religion forbids them to join in such an exercise. These children are not disturbing the peace or interfering in any way with the rights of others. All they ask is that the same tolerance be extended toward them. To deny it to them seems a particularly cheap form of bullying.-Hingham Civic Leader in Boston </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Herald.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>From a 92-Year-Old Pioneer</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The hour and minute hands of a clock are together at twelve o’clock. When is the next time they will be together ? This problem can be worked out in three ways: by analysis, by proportion, and by algebra.' The answer is, in 65-5/11 minutes, or, at 5-5/11 minutes after one o’clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What is the most beautiful thing in the universe? A little girl answered, “My mother’s face.” Is there anything more beautiful? Yes. What is it? Read my report card below and excuse poor writing, as you know I am 92 years and 5 months of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Everything pertaining to Jehovah is infinite. Light, traveling to all eternity, can never get beyond the center of infinity. Jehovah has always lived in the center of infinity, and always will. “For thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy.”—Isaiah 57:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">His attributes are all infinite: life, light, glory, love, wisdom, power, justice, mercy, beauty, harmony, joy, peace, and everything else desirable. Is there not an infinite number of mysteries yet to be revealed ? What little we know about this world is proof of it. JTow light, heat, electricity, gravity, magnetism, were created, and for what purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Is it not astonishing that intelligent creatures, made in God’s moral and intellectual image, should be so deceived by the Devil (see John 12:40 and 2 Corinthians 4:3,4) that they refuse to love such a Being, on whom they depend for'life and everything else?— when His purpose is to make all His creatures * just like Himself, according to their capacities; when His purpose is to fill infinity with happy worlds. “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,”— Isaiah 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All He requires is ‘‘to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God”, (Micah 6:8) Can you imagine anything more reasonable than to love God supremely, and your neighbor as yourself? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">That </span><span class="font9">means: try to make everybody around you happy ; that means everybody and every thing growing better and better for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is just as true as the Bible, and everybody living will know it by experience in the very near future.—E. B. Haynes, Massachusetts pioneer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">: ; zerland, Salvador de Madariaga, ambassador of the Spanish Republic to the United States, urged his fellow Spaniards io stop the civil war and come to peace with one another, because Spain is being destroyed, and only foreigners will reap any possible benefits from the conflict now devastating the land. In one place he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To be sure, one side is fighting to free Spain from what it sees as tyranny, the other from what it sees as anarchy. But is there worse anarchy and worse tyranny than those implied in civil war? Let them bear in mind the appalling host of the dead and the still more appalling host of the living, for ever spiritually maimed by what they have suffered, seen and, worst of all, done.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ President Roosevelt was panned, and justly so, for causing to be rushed through Congress a one-sided neutrality measure which discriminates against the legitimate government of Spain. Under international law and by custom and by American practice, the Spanish government has the right to buy in America the things which it needs to defend itself against Fascism (Catholic Action). In rushing through this legislation, Uncle Sam played directly into the hands of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and that of the British Foreign Office, which the Hierarchy controls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Imaginary Government Receives Envoys </span><span class="font9">♦ General Franco’s imaginary government was recognized by the Italian and German governments’ sending envoys to him. All it amounts to is a recognition by two outlaws, two murderers, of a third one. But it has the pope’s “blessing”. And that is something, isn’t it? Incidentally, the pope himself, another murderer at heart, officially recognized the Franco government, on May 16, 1938.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>Tobacco More Deadly to Females Than to Males</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">THERE is a great controversy fe-j&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garding the effects of the use of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">tobacco. Those who want to smoke <sup>or e</sup>^<sup>ew can alwa</sup>&gt;<sup>7S</sup> find excuse . <sub>an(</sub>j <sub>a</sub>j<sub>so sonie</sub> &lt;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<sub>note(</sub>j <sub>sc</sub>i<sub>en</sub>tist” who has proved conclusively to their satisfaction that tobacco is not harmful, and, in fact, that it is a great germicide, and many other wonderful things in its favor. They will usually refer to some man 75, or 80, or 100 years of age, who has used it from childhood, and because they find a few here and there who have withstood its poisonous effects these are held up as positive proof of the non-injurious effect of the use of tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who do not believe in the use of tobacco, because it is injurious to both body and mind, point to some very interesting facts to prove its destructive influence over every phase of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are many reasons for opposing its use, but none is more interesting than the recent reports made from the American University of Beirut, Syria; the University of Chicago, and the University of Nebraska. Their experiments have been published in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</span><span class="font9"> Three hundred and thirty-six rats were used in the experiment. A concentration of one percent of nicotine alkaloid was given subcutaneously. The dose was correct for body weight, which killed three out of thirty-two male rats and killed twelve out of the same number of females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The same results were noticed in the injections of nicotine where an increase of the last dose killed every one of the remaining females, but was not fatal to one-fourth of the surviving males. It was estimated that it would take about 25 percent more nicotine to kill 25, 50, and 75 of the male rats than the same percentage of the females. It is an obvious conclusion that women (or female rats) are not able to resist the poisonous effect of nicotine as are the men (or male rats). If this is a fact, what will be the effect on our future generations ? The increase of smoking is terrific and is gaining at an alarming rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some time ago I saw published in a prominent journal the report that 60 percent of the babies of smoking mothers died within their first year. I also saw published in another journal that the blood of newly-born babies of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">22</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">smoking mothers carried in it a large element of nicotine. This being a fact, what chance has the coming generation if born of women saturated with nicotine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When will our national leaders be awakened to the crime of teaching or even permitting the use of so deadly a drug?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Every child has a right to be born of a mother possessing a good, clean blood stream. No parents who are guilty of saturating their bodies with such a deadly poison have a right, when begetting children, to expect other than the possibilities of an invalid child or one in some way physically or mentally subnormal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An investigation was recently made of a newly-born baby that remained in an unconscious state for many hours after birth, yet was evidently alive. Examination of the blood stream revealed the presence of a large amount of alcohol. The mother had consumed a large amount of liquor of some character the day before the child was born. The child was literally drunk when born, and as soon as its system could eliminate the alcohol the child became normal.-Seattle (Wash.) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vita-Therapist.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>By Trail and Stream and Garden Path-—Wings of June</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">“SALLY,” Jane called, “wait a moment. I believe I see a moth.” ^3? y “A luna?” asked Sally, hurry-BSgfesCl ing back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">' ' ' ' ' “No. This time we are to make the acquaintance of another of our Winged Shadows of the night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jane reached up to the trailing branch of the silver birch and gently lifted down the moth. For a moment the six sturdy, grayish legs worked frantically, then curled up quietly. The underwings were mostly a tannish-gray, in a delicate lacy design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Unbelievable!” murmured Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Wait till you’ve seen the upper wings,” Jane promised. “They are the joy of every moth admirer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Very slowly, then, Jane released the great, velvety wings, at the same time laying a finger along the little barbed feet, With scarcely any motion, the moth curled its six heavy legs around the support offered them, and just as easily lowered its wings till they were spread out flat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sally caught her breath, and said not a word. The soft tan of the hind wings was broken by a glistening circlet of blue, while a smaller, lighter circle marked the forewings. Both sets of wings were crossed by a band of , pink—a deep pink, with almost a mulberry tint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The large, tan body was covered with thick, soft down which seemed almost like tiny feathers. On the head were two immense plumes, so broad and heavy they seemed out of proportion to the rest of the body. It was at these plumes Sally was now looking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“What are those things?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Antennae,” Jane replied. “And they mark one of the chief differences between moth and butterfly. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“You mean, butterflies don’t have them?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Oh, yes; but a very different kind. The antennae of all moths are plumes. Butterflies, on the other hand, have smooth, rather hard antennae which end in a ball or a hook. Some moths, the imperial for instance, have such slender antennae that at first glance they appear to he smooth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Jane, could I hold the moth awhile?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Surely. Here, catch him — no, not that way; he’ll flutter and injure his wings. Slip </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 16, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">your fingers behind and under his wings, down close to the body. Now, gradually close your fingers, keeping his wings firm between them. Don’t pinch too hard, but be sure to hold tightly enough that he can’t rub his wings back and forth. That spoils them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“There. Is that right?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Just right. Lift him up and hold him awhile so his feet don’t touch anything. See how quiet he is? Now, put your index finger against his legs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Oooh! How he grabs! His feet almost hurt. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Notice the way he pulls now?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And how strong he is! Why, Jane, I can scarcely hold him! He almost pulls out of my fingers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Yes, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">he may hurt his wings. That is why it is best not to allow his legs to touch anything.’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“Polyphemus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Ill </span><span class="font9">call him ‘Polly’ for short. Now, what shall I do with him?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Let go his wings very slowly. He’ll settle, most likely, without attempting to fly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“His little feet feel so funny. Isn’t it wonderful, Jane?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“It surely is, Sally. We should be able to find quite a few moths if we continue our evening walks. You see, June is the month of moths.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I should say it must be!” cried Sally. “There’s a tan-colored moth -just settling on that twig above your head. Only it’s small.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Propaganda recently put out from Washington enlarges upon the cooperation there of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the Washington - Federation of Churches (representing the Protestant interests), and the rabbis of the principal synagogues at the capital to emphasize the importance of “religion in our national life ”, The president is a booster for it. It makes no difference what the religion is, only so that it is a religion. How silly! There are thousands of religions, and every one of them is a dishonor to the name of God, because it ignores Him and His Word and propagates something else. But this crowd means business. Notice this in the propaganda, put out to the world by David Lawrence, newspaperman, in his “Survey of the National Government”:</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Helping the President Out</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The president knows there is something wrong, and took a probe at it in his message to the United Council of American Methodism when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a world perplexed by doubt and fear and uncertainty there is need for a return to religion as exemplified in the Sermon on the Mount,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus said, among other things,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or' one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: hut Whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. — Matthew 5:17-19,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These are good words for President Roosevelt to bring to the attention of the American people. They show that Jesus was standing by the Scriptures, to the last, jot and the last tip-of-a-letter (tittle). He was not standing by the hypocrites, the scribes and Pharisees, popes and cardinals, bishops, priests, friars, nuns and other religious frauds; He was standing by the Word of God, and so are Jehovah’s witnesses doing today, and for which faithfulness to Gog such witnesses have been and are being imprisoned to this day in almost every part of the country over which Mr. Roosevelt aspires to be dictator. Mr. Roosevelt has had these matters brought to his attention repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The president has been provided with opportunity to learn the details of more than a thousand such cases of persecution, mostly at the hands of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, with which Hierarchy he is on such excellent terms. One wonders that he does not familiarize himself with these facts, so that when he preaches from the Sermon on the Mount, or refers to it, he may have recourse to modern fulfillments of Jesus’ words. He would thus help the president out. See Matthew 5; 10-12,</span></p>

Not long ago three illiterate Negroes in a southern state were convicted of killing their white employer. The only evidence against them was the tortured confessions wrung from their lips by methods which recalled the Hark</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ages. Nevertheless they were convicted and sentenced to die by a jury whose verdict was approved by the judge, and affirmed by the highest court in that state. They faced the last long mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But between them and the gallows there was one detour left—■ the Supreme Court of the United States, composed of nine men not responsible to anybody but their conscience and their oath to preserve the Constitution and with it the constitutional rights of every American, white or black, rich or poor, Protestant or Catholic, Gentile or Jew.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">It was a free court, and because it was free, and only because it was free, it held unanimously within the past year that the Constitution protected these three helpless, illiterate Negroes who could not even read the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Court said that “The torture chamber and the rack cannot bo substituted for the witness stand” here in America. Those words were pronounced by one of these “nine old men” —.Honorable Charles Evans Hughes. When he suiid them he not only gave a new ■ trial to these three men, but gave added safety and protection to the 12,000,000 men and women of their race and to all other men who might be the victims of mob rule or the third degree. I am sure they are going to think a long time before joining in any effort that will or might subject the Supreme Court of the United States to political pressure.</span></p>

Apart from poverty, or a less extreme impairment of the savings which afford the chief protection to the working class against old age and the hazards of illness, a matter of inestimable consequence to society as a whole, and apart from the loss of purchasing power, the legislature could have concluded that unemployment brings in its wake increase in vagrancy and crimes against property, reduction in the number of marriages, deterioration of family life, decline in the birth rate, increase in illegitimate births, impairment of the health of the unemployed and malnutrition of their children.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>Open Letter to British Labor Party</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Laborites:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How vociferous are you for the welfare of humanity! You seem to have it so much at heart! Doubtless this should be so, seeing that so many of you have sprung from the masses. You are better able to appreciate the lot of the poor, their hardships, their struggles for existence, and their impoverishment of mind and body. The sincere amongst you have tried to lift these burdens and alleviate the suffering, and in some measure have succeeded. But to-<sup>L</sup>day ’the sincerity of the party is in question, and this letter will give the reason why it is so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Fascist and Nazi bullies are stalking the earth, browbeating and bludgeoning all who oppose them, while you set up a cry for deliverance and justice. But your cry does not ring true; for you know the real enemies of mankind. Your ulterior motives prevent you from exposing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You are fully conscious that the Nazis and Fascists were born of the masses. Both Hitler and Mussolini held socialistic blandishments before the people, and, having ensnared them, they sacrificed them on the Fascist altar. In your own party today you are harboring the same reactionary elements that will, in a short time, turn and rend you. None know better than yourselves that the Fascist and Nazi militants are the secular arm wielding the sword for the religious hierarchy of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But this is where you must hush-hush. Your party depends on the Catholic political vote; hence you dare not expose the system. Your own labor councils are dominated in scores of cases with Catholic socialists, and under the pretense of socialism they are playing fast and loose with the militant forces of reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A recent article in a London paper reveals that many of your sincere members are alarmed at what they see, and are endeavoring to stem the tide. Said the London </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Socialist Catholics are suspected of favoring the junta cause. In Camberwell Mrs. A. Egan, the socialist councillor, was refused nomination for the next Borough Council elections. Her husband, also a socialist councillor, was refused nomination. Both are Catholies. Mr. T. O’Brien, a prominent trade unionist leader, said to the reporter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is a tendency in many boroughs to regard Roman Catholics as suspect; it is common practice to mistrust any Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Labor Party knows full well that Jehovah’s witnesses are denied free speech in many of the town halls where labor rules. No explanation is forthcoming, except “We have had complaints”. When pressed as to who makes them, there is nothing but evasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Labor cannot afford to lose the Catholic franchise: it is its sheet anchor in Greater London and vital to its existence in the provinces. The Labor council of London has done much for Catholics in giving them greater foothold in a Protestant country. Especially is this <sub>;</sub>so with regard to educational facilities. To get the vote, labor must pay the price. Thus the party is weakened and sapped of its strength by a hierarchy designated in the Scriptures as a “harlot”. Caughi in the toils of this wicked voluptuary, you trade on her influence to get power; but she will be unfaithful to you. She has many lovers, and the imposing “blackshirt” is far more handsome. You are the cat’s-paw. She flatters you, but in her heart hates you and your principles of democracy. Your daily press, so loud in its support of liberty, is muzzled where the interests of the “harlot” are concerned. It dare not expose what it knows to be true. It fears the powers of the priests; it dreads boycott and loss in circulation; and so both press and party are inveigled into the snare. Too late you will discover how you have been fooled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let the people of good will amongst you take heed, Jehovah’s King is here, assembling the nations to pour upon them all His fierce anger.

<p><span class="font9">♦ In December, 1937, Grey Owl, famous halfbreed Chief Scout of the North American Indians, author and lecturer, friend of wild life, refused to lecture over the air waves controlled by the hypocritical British Broadcasting Company (which company is under control of British clergymen), because the</span></p>

Which one was civilized, the one who wanted wild life to have a chance, or the aiders and abettors of murder wholesale, who have control of what goes out over the air to radio-listeners in Britain?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ For exposing for sale 30 eggs that were overripe a Bethnal Green (London) grocer was fined £16 and 10 guineas cost and was obliged to post a notice on his front door for 21 days proclaiming to all, '‘I have been convicted of exposing for sale bad eggs.” This setting of the gentleman back a little over $4 for each of the antique eggs, besides all the loss of trade occasioned by the sign on his door, it is figured, will make the grocer a little more concerned for the public hereafter, and a little less eager for immediate profits which may take to themselves wings and fly away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ Sweetening the demand for a united Ireland, the Irish Free State, despite the fact that it is overwhelmingly Catholic, nominated a Protestant for president, which nomination was endorsed by both political parties and approved by Cardinal Macrory. It was a clever move for conquering with molasses a people that cannot be conquered by force, and will do more to bring Ulster under Roman Catholic control than any of the recent abortive attempts to gain the same end by midnight assassinations and arson by marauders from across the line.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ In England four young men, all well educated and all with rich relatives, enticed a representative of a jewelry firm to a small hotel, beat him, and robbed him of gems valued at £13,000. They were given nine years to eighteen months at hard labor, and three of them were given 15 to 20 strokes of cat-o nine-tails, one of the most terrible of human penalties, because they knew better and their conduct was inexcusable. For the most part, the British people think the judgment was just.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ “Reverend Father” F. Woodlock, in a sermon at Oxford, complains that in England there are over 1,000,000 married couples with no children, and over 2,500,000 with only one child, and thinks something should be done about it. Not wishing to butt in on a delicate problem like this, but just a suggestion that maybe the dividing up of monasteries, convents and orphan and foundling asylums into cozy little apartments would help some. Better still, that the materials of which they are composed were used in making little homes where children would love to come and of which they would, in later years, have happy memories.</span></p>

News arrived that his wife had just borne him a son at Caernarvon. He said, “Will you accept a prince born in Wales who cannot speak a word of English, and of blameless life?” They said they would, whereupon he took them to Caernarvon and, somewhat to their surprise, presented to them his baby.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>The Reverend (!) Clergy</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">HAT these gentlemen, made into &quot;reverends’' by their fellow er^tsmen, should manifest their anger against the witness which Jehovah is now sending through the earth, is not a matter for surprise. They are in the same position as the craftsmen of Ephesus were when Paul’s witness concerning the Lord Jesus and the kingdom of God threatened the ruin of their business, the making of silver shrines for Diana. Paul told the people of Ephesus that Diana and all tl _ like were no gods, but the work of men, and their worship of the Devil. The craftsmen held a meeting and then decided to get up a commotion amongst the people by telling them their religion was being held at nought. They failed to do harm to Paul, but, his witness having been given and his work there being finished, he left them. The faithful disciples remained to continue the witness to the things concerning the kingdom of God which Paul had started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But there is a closer analogy, and a more significant one: these men take the same posi<sub>: </sub>tion towards the witness to the Kingdom as that taken by the clergy in the days of Jesus when He was on earth. Certainly those learned Jews made themselves believe they were right and that He was a mischievous intruder, untaught, and getting disciples from among the ignorant classes. But that which really stirred them was the danger to their position: they well knew the power of the truth there was in His message from God, and their fear developed into hatred, and quickly to His death, and, later, to their destruction. They could not meet Him as to His teaching, and they began to speak evil of Him, and at last they got up a charge that He was seditious and was a danger to the state. The old priest-politician put it very frankly to his fellow's when he said, &quot;It is expedient for us, that one man should die<sup>:</sup> for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. ’ ’ In this day, when the witness of the establishment of the Kingdom under the direction of the present Lord is being given, the clergy take the same attitude towards the message, and they have the same spirit towards the witnesses of Jehovah. One of them cries out in his pulpit, &quot;Heresy”; another in his magazine says, &quot;Aifti-Christian”; another in his publication has no hesitancy in repeating wicked and malicious lies of Torrey the dead &quot;evangelist”, who hated the truth and therefore hated God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">They Are AU Alike</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• Early in April at the annual meeting of the Scottish Colportage Society in Edinburgh, &quot;Rev.” W. Whie Anderson, of St. Cuthbert’s parish church, told the meetings that recently two respectable-looking young men called at his home in Edinburgh with pamphlets which they were selling as &quot;Bibles” on behalf of a certain organization. He went on to say, &quot;On examination they proved to be not real Bibles at all, but books containing revolutionary literature cunningly concealed in religious matter. ” Had he left the matter there this magazine could have nothing to say about him or what he said. But he went on to tell of the report of a Royal Commission which was set up in the copper-belt of Rhodesia, and wherein this same organization, the &quot;Watch Tower”, was blamed for much of the trouble among the natives, whose rioting became the cause of the commission’s being sent there to report. The report is a Government publication and can be obtained in the usual H. M. stationery depots. The simple facts are these: The natives, treated much as slaves, considered themselves to be unfairly treated: they were ill-paid, and sometimes ill-treated by their overseers. At last a disturbance broke out and there was'rioting in the mines and the compounds, and owing to some agitation the government in London appointed a Royal Commission to go there and report on the matter. Now it was the case that in that region of Northern Rhodesia there was a kind of religious activity, spoken of by the natives, and by others, as &quot;the Watch Tower movement”. It had no relation to or kinship with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Cape Town, whose representatives labor in all the South and East African countries, carrying the message of the kingdom of God, and its good.news for the peoples. This native 'movement' was started by a Glasgow man, who had been, sent out as a missionary by one of the religious societies. He became interested in the publications of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, but was more interested in a movement of his own conception. He was either the conceiver of the Ethiopian movement or one of its earliest agitators ; but he used the name ‘'Watch Tower” in this interest, though there was no association wha tever with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. That movement, wholly native, developed some fantastical ideas, and, sometime after the Great War, gave trouble to the European governors. When the Royal Commission was being set up some person saw a. chance of doing damage to the message of Jehovah’s witnesses, and a Presbyterian parson was made a member of the Commission. The end was gained. The report carries no evidences whatsoever that the friends of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society were in any way connected with the trouble which led to the rioting, nor any evidence that the native movement was connected, yet the gratuitous suggestion was made that the dissemination of the Society’s literature was a probable preliminary cause of the trouble. If the religionists had not. been involved in the arranging of its members, and the fixing of the report, the trouble would have been dealt with for what it was, namely, a labor trouble which arose out of bad conditions of<sub>v</sub>labor, and ill-treatment of the laborers. The Presbyterian minister of St. Cuthbert’s church, in his desire to do hurt to Jehovah’s witnesses, goes for a bit extra.: he says, as if the Commission report had stated it, “Actually they were revolutionaries of the worst, type,” and be warned the people of Edinburgh against these ‘bad people’. Inquiry has been made of Jehovah’s witnesses in Edinburgh to check on the “reverend’s” story of two young men trying to sell him pamphlets for Bibles. It is said that none of them has witnessed in his immediate neighborhood since September last. To say the least, his story is a mix-up; Jehovah’s witnesses do not sell their books and booklets: but it sufficed for the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After the Northern Rhodesian affair some religionists in Southern Rhodesia tried the same stunt of affirmation that the Society’s literature is seditious, seeking thus to suppress the message of the kingdom of God. A cqsc went from court to court till it got to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. In a full review of the ease in question the judgment of the Court was that, “there is nothing in any of the books intended to incite people to.use force against the gov-J U </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 15, 1938 </span><span class="font9">eminent, or to revolt, or to commit breaches </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the peace”.</span><span class="font9"> The Court cited several passages from the publications which incite to peace and obedience to the laws of any land, except w’here these are in direct violation of God’s law. The case was dismissed with costs against the objectors, and the publications stand free of the charges and insinuations of the religionists and their supporters. A little inquiry in Edinburgh, or anywhere else, as to the lives and motives of action of Jehovah’s witnesses would prove to him that they are more peace-loving than he is; for they are moved by the spirit of Christ, and he is moved by another spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Political Kaleidoscope</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• The political kaleidoscope is not being turned around so quickly at the moment. But the dictators cannot rest on their accomplishments ; were they to do so they would soon perish : movement and surprise is their only chance of keeping their position. Hitler and Mussolini must continue to scheme for bigger and greater things, either, as in Hitler’s case, to sfiow “divine appointment”, or, with Mussolini, to show' what a “big man” he is. The Hierarchy is always secretly pushing on to its ends. But since the Devil is at war with the Son of God, disputing the right to rule in Uis kingdom as set by Jehovah, these men wflio are his chief instruments will not be allowed to rest. Also, as Judge Rutherford has shown, Jehovah is maneuvering the forces of evil in position to bring destruction upon the Devil and all his agents, and all w<sup>r</sup>ho stand for them in preparation for the battle of the great day of God Almighty. By His prophet Zephaniah (3:8) Jehovah put this on record: “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey ; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my,fierce anger: for a.ll the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” Undoubtedly that prophecy is in process of fulfillment. East and west, north and south, all the nations of the earth are involved in the world troubles. In the Great War they were joined in two mighty units, in conflict ; now they are in the turmoil of national disputes, but. all are bound in the distress which is settling on the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The nations have'refused the rule of Jehovah’s. King, and Armageddon must follow,</span></p>
