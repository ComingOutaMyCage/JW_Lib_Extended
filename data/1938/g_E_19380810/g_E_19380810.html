<p><span class="font17">a</span><span class="font5"> Three boys were boasting about the earning capacity of their fathers. The first one said: “My father can write a few lines, call it poetry, and sell it for five dollars.” The second one said: “That’s nothing, my father is a preacher. He ean write a few lines, get up in church and say them, and it takes six men to carry the money down the aisles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Witticisms on Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ My </span><span class="font5">opinion of food is that we make too little use of it. We don’t use food as a weapon; but we should, because it is a weapon which is in everybody’s hands. We extend ourselves and our credit to please people with food, but have you thought of punishing people with food!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have you considered humiliating people or annoying people merely by serving them food ? Have you thought of the twenty different shades of expression that you can achieve through the food you give your guests?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For people of the type who try to embarrass others there is revenge in embarrassing them with food. You can serve them crunehy food that they cannot eat silently, try as they will, or fibrous food that will stick in their teeth or food that is difficult to chase around a plate. Give others food that is hard to cut and chew, or give a whole meal of mushy food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Or you might serve the finest foods that one would want to eat—with a strong cabbage odor coming from the kitchen. You ean reverse that and greet your guest with a delicious odor from the kitchen and then serve second-rate food. And, of course, you can always give too little food, which is a complete revenge in itself.—Gilbert Seldes, noted author, in an address at the Gourmet Society, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rules</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ An </span><span class="font5">old Scotsman was smoking in the waiting room of a railway station. A porter said to him: “Don’t you sec that notice on the wall, ‘No Smoking Allowed’&quot;?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, I do,” said the Scot, “but how can I keep all your rules? There’s another on the wall, *Wear Spire!la corsets.’ ”</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font1">President Roosevelt Comforts Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle f Or who shall rest upon thy holy hillf Even he that leadeth an nneorrupt life, and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart. He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbor, and hath not slandered his neighbor. He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes and maketh much of them that fear Jehovah, He that sweareth unto his neighbor, and disappointeth him not, though it were to his own hindrance. He that hath not given his money upon usury, nor taken reward against the innocent. Who so doeth these things shall never fall.—Psalm 15:1-5,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">y </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">President Roosevelt must be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">■*—</span><span class="font5">quite a student of the Holy Scrip* tures. He is on record as having k placed the above scripture at the head of a story which he gave to the press on the morning of his fifth anniversary of inauguration,<sup>1</sup> and as having said that it should be placed at the top of any story. It is well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here in the office the only translations of the above Psalm that are in regular use are: American Revised Authorized (so called) Chicago University Docay (Roman Catholic) ' Fenton</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Harkavy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Latter-day Saints (Mormon) <sub>h</sub> Leeser (Hebrew) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Margolis (Hebrew)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Moulton</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Revised (English Revision) Rotherham</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Schofield</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Young</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These fifteen versions are all excellent, and so is the presidents, which differs from all of them in many places in the words used to express the same thoughts. Probably the reporters made a slip in the expression “holy will”; and so this has been corrected to read “holy hill”, to agree with the original text of the Hebrew. To further help the president:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 10,1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word Jehovah is used twice in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Psalm, </span><span class="font5">as in the original Hebrew. The president was misled into using the word Lord in both </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of • </span><span class="font5">those places. With these slight corrections let his translation stand. It is good enough to suit anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Them That Fear Jehovah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president believes that it will be well in the end with the one that “maketh much of them that fear Jehovah”; and that is just </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font5">actly 100-percent true. Jehovah’s witnesses find great comfort in that promise. They stake their eternal destiny on their fear of Jehovah, and their unwillingness to turn from their . devotion to Him, and their service of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Him </span><span class="font5">and His truth, though the Devil’s '‘heavens” fall and his “earth” and all that is therein be dissolved into smoke and pass into nothingness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lamar 'Clay, seventy years of age, visited some people in La Grange, Georgia, talked with them about the gracious purposes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Jehovah to bring life and happiness to the people on earth and left with them some printed matter explaining the Scriptures. For </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">do</span><span class="font5">ing this he was convicted of crime and sentenced to thirty days in a chain gang, with 55 others: He was incarcerated in a cow stable, so filthy and indecent that the city authorities responsible therefor were strongly condemned by the State Department of Public Welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the president desires, in this instancy to “make much of them that fear Jehovah’’, and desires to send somd message of comfort</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font5">to Mr. Clay for his courageous stand on Jehovah’s side, as against the clergy of the Devil, he-will be supplied Mr. Clay’s full address on application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Delinquency of Minors</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">F m James Dziatkiewiez, himself one M of Jehovah’s witnesses, has two ehil-dren who share his desire to do something to offset the stream of defamation constantly leveled against Jehovah’s name. Mary and John are pupils in the public schools. They use much of their spare time in visiting the people to tell them of Jehovah God’s kingdom and the blessings it will bring to humanity. For so doing they were arrested at Irvington, New Jersey, and charged with juvenile delinquency. The father and mother of these two lovely and' lovable children were also arrested, charged With contributing to the delinquency of minors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the president desires, in this instance, to ■make public condemnation of such acts of intolerance against those that fear and serve Jehovah, he will bo given full information on application. Such action on his part not only would fulfill his expressed desire to “make much of them that fear Jehovah”, but would put some fear in the hearts'of religious inquisitors who are historically and actually the servants of the Devil, and it would do much toward keeping alive the liberties of the American people, now fast passing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Roy D. Goodrich, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, was arrested and-thrown into jail at West Palm Beach, Florida, where he was then beaten and maltreated to such an extent that he became a physical wreck, yet he had violated no law and no charges were ever filed against him. How would it do for the president to “make much of them that fear Jehovah” by public condemnation of such acts as were done in this instance in the West Palm Beach jail by those who have sworn, as has the president himself, to protect the humblest American citizen in his rights, and that regardless of whether he fears Jehovah or not ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Denial of Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Walter Gobitas, a good American citizen, and one of Jehovah’s witnesses, is in the grocery business at Minersville, Pennsylvania. He has two. children, Lillian and William.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Federal Judge Maris said of these two children :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[They] are conscientiously opposed to saluting the flag, since they consider such action to be a direct violation of Divine commandments laid down in the Bible, Liberty of conscience means liberty for each individual to decide for himself what is to him religious. To permit public officers to determine whether the views of individuals sincerely held and their acts sincerely undertaken on religious grounds are in fact based on convictions religious in character would be to sound the death knell of -religious liberty. To such a pernicious and alien doctrine this court cannot subscribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lillian and William were denied education ’N by the Minersville school board because they * were conscientious in their fear of Jehovah. If the president, in this instance, desires to “make much of them that fear Jehovah”, here is a wonderful opportunity to publicly reprimand this school board that has undertaken to place its will as to what children must do above the will of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president might be interested in the fact that numerous radio stations have received persistent requests for free time on the air from associates of a Roman Catholic Franciscan Father, Richard Felix, who is on record as openly advocating acts of intoler-anee and physical violence against Jehovah’s witnesses, and especially Judge Rutherford, for speaking and otherwise disseminating Bible truths in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If, in this instance, the president desires to “make much of them that fear Jehovah”, he could very well use his high office to encourage open discussion between an accredited spokesman of the Roman Catholic organization and Judge Rutherford, whose whole life is devoted to aiding “them that fear Jehovah”. Why not a little team work with those that take no stock in the antique, fossilized racket worked from Vatican City? Why be afraid of the truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Denial of Right of Petition</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19380810_files/g_E_19380810-2.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:44pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Charles R. Hessler, in July, 1935, in Maplewood, New Jersey, circulated a protest and petition addressed to the mayor and city council and was trailed for two hours by an officer in a police car, whose presence in front of the homes he visited intimidated many who wished to sign but were fear- ' fui of retaliation on the part of the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At length he visited the home of a Catholic, who refused to sign the petition and demanded Hessler’s arrest, which was what the police officer was waiting for. Copies of the protest and petition, which was lawful evidence in the case, were confiscated and Hessler .was searched, all his belongings taken away, and he was held in prison twenty hours before being released in the custody of his attorneys. He was then tried and fined one hundred dollars, with an alternative of thirty days in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president desires to “make much of them that fear Jehovah”. Here is another rare chance. If memory serves right, he holds a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font5">conspicuous place on the National Conference \ of Jews and Christians. Perhaps he could suggest to them that they individually and collectively abide by the law, and keep from such a course as the Jews of ancient time followed against the prophets and later resorted to to put to death the Savior of men, and which course is now fully approved by the Roman Hierarchy and the Protestant clergy in the injustices they so eagerly practice against those who fear Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president should be interested in the proposal of a judge at Northampton, Massachusetts, to send to a reformatory three children of Ignace Opielouski, Belchertown, Massachusetts, because they dared put God above the flag of their country. He might do something about that; also about the smashing of windows of the home of Jehovah’s witnesses at Howard Beach, New York, where gangs took turns in the work, being encouraged to do so by the local Roman Catholic priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Denial of Right of Livelihood</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">George Leoles, Atlanta, Georgia, was a law-abiding citizen of the United States in business in that city for thirty years. His daughter became convinced that it is wrong to put the flag above obedience to Jehovah God. When she refused to salute the flag the American Legion and the Ku KIux Klan picketed his shop and destroyed his business. Their attitude toward “them that fear Jehovah” is worthy of severe executive censure. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">0. R. Moyle, attorney, is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Because he defended these witnesses and “made much of them that fear Jehovah”, Judge Holleran, of Irvington, New Jersey, threatened, “I will stab you in the back at every opportunity”; another judge </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 10,1938 </span><span class="font5">intimated he would be held in contempt if he continued to aid the witnesses in their struggle to exercise their rights; and on another occasion the editor of this magazine was with him when both were threatened with arrest because Moyle called at a police station in behalf of his clients. Here is another chance for the president to “make much of them that fear Jehovah”, and not make so much of some others, Moyle’s address is 0, R. Moyle, 117 Adams street, Brooklyn, New York. If the president or any of his aides desire to obtain information on any of these eases, apply there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">George Rossier was one of sixty of Jehovah’s witnesses arrested and jailed in Plain-field, New Jersey, and held overnight in quarters crowded to suffocation, for the trial next day. One of those tried was a partially deaf woman. For daring to voice to the presiding magistrate a respectful offer to help that woman he was arbitrarily silenced by the magistrate and ordered locked up for five months. How about a little reproof of those that do not fear Jehovah, by one, who, if he means what he says, desires to “make much of them that do”? Why all the heavy silence?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why the Ruthless Cruelty?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Charles J. Sandstrom, Ronkonkoma, New York, has a daughter Grace, who conscientiously believes the God-given command at Exodus 20:3-5 means what it says and that the flag should not be saluted. The parents were haled into court and convicted of a criminal offense on the charge of keeping Grace home from school, when the facts were that they were anxious to send her to school and did send her to school but the school officials would not allow her to stay because she did not. “Heil Hitler” after their ideas. She was expelled from school, and threatened with incarceration in a reformatory, and except that friends provided private instruction the parents would have been sent to jail and the daughter committed to the care and companionship of politicians and prostitutes. Here is another good chance to say something in behalf of “them that fear Jehovah”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief executive should also be interested to learn of the arrest and imprisonment of Wallace Vick on the charge of violating the so-called “anti-Nazi law” of New Jersey. At the time of its enactment this statute was claimed by its sponsors to be a measure to prevent Nazi activities in the state. But although</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nazi organizations are very active in New Jersey, Mr. Vick was the only person ever charged with violation of that law, and the real reason why he was charged with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it was </span><span class="font5">simply that he is one of “them that fear Jehovah”, of which the president, so he says, is so desirous to make much. Well, let him go ahead and really make it. What is stopping him? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Harry Whittaker, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, was sentenced to 90 days in the penitentiary of Hudson County, New Jersey, because he is one of such witnesses. That was the only real case against him. While in the penitentiary itself he refused to salute the flag and disobey God’s law in Exodus 20:3-5. Eor this he was sentenced to solitary confinement in the dark dungeon, with nothing to do, no one to talk to, nothing to read, and only bread and water for food. Why the desire in America to ape Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Odd Treatment of Those</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">That Fear Jehovah</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19380810_files/g_E_19380810-3.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Those that fear Jehovah receive some odd treatment in the United States. For example, in Chicago, Illinois, Mary Schlorehetka was fined $210 because she refused to salute the flag. At Peoria, on the demand of a priest, over a hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested, some while sitting in their cars </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">others while walking on the streets or standing at street corners; their property </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">confiscated; they were denied the right to telephone for legal aid, were threatened with violence by police officials and were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">abused </span><span class="font5">by them, and were confined in filthy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">prison </span><span class="font5">cells and denied food while incarcer</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ated. At </span><span class="font5">Wheaton, Illinois, Mildred Slosser </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">fined $125 for informing her neighbors about God’s kingdom for which, it is believed, the president prays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And about Pennsylvania, where the editor lived for many years. It is the Keystone State, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">in that state, only a few months ago, men and women were confined in the same cell of the prison, at Brownsville, because they were Jehovah’s witnesses. About the same time, at Canonsburg, in the same state, children were beaten, choked, ridiculed, tortured, expelled from school, and refused medical aid because they refused to salute the flag. At Coatesville the mayor said Jehovah’s witnesses must stay </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font5">out of town. At Easton radio station WEST was boycotted for carrying the programs of Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Mauch Chunk Jehovah’s witnesses were jailed and the police admitted that the arrests were made at the behest of the clergy. At Millsboro officers of the law and a mob joined in beating, kicking, choking and striking Jehovah’s witnesses, ransacking their automobiles, and taking and destroying the contents consisting of Bible literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Monessen over a hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses were convicted without evidence and without trial and thrown into prison for exercising the right of petition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>f</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At New Philadelphia 44 of Jehovah’s witnesses were assaulted and imprisoned on demand of priests of the town, their Bible literature destroyed, and their automobiles damaged, and they were fined $5 each. Their only “offense” was that of disseminating Bible truths among the people of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Philadelphia radio station WIP was threatened with boycott by Cardinal Dougherty and one of his priests, James Clarke, for daring to broadcast the Bible questions and answers of Judge Rutherford.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Some are surprised that the United States X needs four million new homes, but President Roosevelt supplies the facts. In the seven years prior to 1930 the annual average of new homes built was 800,000; then it suddenly dropped to less than one-fourth that number, where it has since remained. Meantime there </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font5">been a growth in number of families needing homes, and 800,000 units per year for the next five years would not more than meet the real needs of the American people during that period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ We hear a great deal nowadays about the nourishing and sustaining powers of whole wheat, but very few people know that wheat was once considered to have great external healing powers as well. An old Roman doctor mentions in his writings the case of a man who cured himself of dropsy by burying himself in a box filled with wheat, so that only his head was visible. The wheat drew out all water, and the man was sound again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Whether or not they got the idea from this case is not stated, but it is recorded that the old Roman doctors healed gout by having the patient cover his legs up to the knees with wheat and remain so until he obtained relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For sore throat the Romans used wheat bruised, cooked in water, and strained, as a gargle. Carbuncles were treated with poultices of wheat* flour, chopped celery, and honey. Tetter, dry scab, ringworm and like ailments they treated with wheat flour mixed with incense and wine, applied as a plaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For sprains, they bruised wheat cooked in vinegar and applied it as a poultice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Turbid wine or cider they cleared as follows; One part wheat flour, one part fresh milk, and one egg-white, mixed well and dropped slowly into the barrel. After four days they drew it into a clean barrel. When wine showed a vinegar taste, they put into a small sack one pound whole wheat and ope pound yellow wax chopped fine, and hung it in the barrel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While these last two items cannot be considered purely medicinal, they do illustrate the purifying quality of the whole wheat; and who is there to prove that,wine cleared with whole wheat is not more beneficial to the system than more ordinary wine?—Dr. Carl Q. Schilling, New Jersey.</span></p>

Those who have not yet had this unnecessary operation will never need it if they live to a million, with this feed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Soak a handful or so, according to taste and age (and fastidiousness), of wheat as it comes from the farm, that is, before the sharks or millers begin to denature it, in water to cover it by an inch. Do this, say, at evening, and it is ready for morning’s breakfast two days after (36 hours approximately). When breakfast is ready, drink off the water, put milk and fruit in a pan or dish, and fall to. Try to avoid poison sugars, etc., and after about five days’ treatment the bowels will begin to function naturally; and if this treatment is continued throughout life, the doctor will not be needed. Do not soak wheat in aluminum, if you have any brains; and eat it raw, not cooked.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A long linen cloth, supposed to have been the shroud of Christ, is exhibited in certain Catholic sections. It contains stains <sub>(</sub>and marks which dimly outline, in negative, the figure of a man about 5 feet 11 inches tall, and weighing approximately 170 pounds. Various evidences are adduced in support of the claim that this linen cloth was indeed the shroud in which the Lord was buried, it being folded over the head and covering the entire body. The cloth, therefore, is at least four yards long, as if taken from a bolt of white goods. Even if it be conceded that there is much about this relic that is remarkable, yet the Scriptures, the source of dependable information, state that Christ’s shroud consisted not of one cloth, but of more than one, and that His head was wound about with a napkin; hence, the entire -figure could not have appeared on a single piece of cloth. See John 20:6,7, which reads.- “Then cometh Simon Peter following him [John], and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes [plural] lie, and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.” Hence, the shroud, even if a genuine shroud, is obviously not that of Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The language of despair is easily recognized. It is that of a man or an organization that is caught in a network of lies and betrays in every sentence it utters thereafter that it is lying, knows it is lying, and knows it is caught; and that sooner or later it will have to quit lying, for the reason that nobody thenceforth will pay any attention. The Boman Hierarchy is like that.

The Hierarchy well knows that once the people get the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Truth,</span><span class="font5"> the jig is all up for the Hierarchy. What sensible human creature could ever say that, knowing a certain thing to be a lie, or tissue of lies, he preferred to believe it anyway, and pay the price? .</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Tua </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Judge Prognosticates</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has never been an age like the present in which civilization could reckon so few thinkers. It is almost accepted as an axiom in our civilization that thought should not be controlled by logic or reason, but should receive its inspiration from the emotional nature of man. Even the laws of God— natural and supernatural—are tampered with, as our civilization gives forth the cry: “Let us make God to our image and likeness!” Protestantism has . strained its supposed Christianity away from all the fundamental doctrines until at present there is nothing left to build upon. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Catholics are being influenced by the inertia of their civilization, ah d they bother little to learn and know the fundamental doctrines of Christianity. They have not the courage to fortify themselves with the knowledge that the Church has to offer. To acquire knowledge by the only way, the hard way of expended effort, is to them irksome. The light frothy literature, the sweet strains of music from the cinema and the radio are all that they are concerned with in life as they ply their way to shipwreck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the midst of this confusion we have the arising (we might say of another “false prophet,” but we have no intentions of being generous) of an ignorant, raving demagogue. Daily or weekly we listen to the blatherings of a man who calls himself a judge, speaking via the airways, telling his radio audience that religion is a racket, and his racket the only religion. He is a brilliant contributor to an age of confusion. He is more apt at the art of confusing than any. If a businessman with no knowledge of medicine should suddenly take the stand and pronounce his views on the art and science of medicine as the only contribution of any value, he would be booed down by the attending audience. But if in theology one arises and pronounces his views as the final contribution to that science, he is listened to with eager ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We do not blame Judge Rutherford for his Venomous tirades against the Catholic Church, since he is a madman, but we do blame those who claim to be his listening audience and who make up the contribution of the millions of dollars to keep this insult to our civilization in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In case our reader is not familiar with the Judge’s prognostications, we will itemize some of them as published in his works and proclaimed on the air;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Judge claims to fight against all religions and says that he does not teach religion. He does not teach religion, that is true, but he pretends to teach religion and makes of himself the only infallible prophet. He is right in his claim that he does hot teach religion since he is only a racketeer: “He mikes uuwarranted assumptions, brazen false-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AU GUST 10,1918 </span><span class="font4">hoods, agonizing prophecies, misapplied Biblical quotations, and weird interpretations of the Sacred Scriptures into an intellectual dish that must give many a ‘Witness of Jehovah’ a belly aehe in the place where his brains ought to be.”—(The Rutft-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">erford Racket,</span><span class="font4"> C. P. Windle.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our civilization has two types of ignorance. First, the simple ignorance of one who does not know but who is willing to learn; second, the compound ignorance of one who doesn’t know, and claims that there is nothing worth knowing except what he knows, and we can call this type of ignorant man a “snob.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is the Rutherford mentality, the snob. He knows nothing of exegesis in the interpretation of the Scriptures and pretends to know all. There is no infallible Church to him. He has the only infallibility in the world. He pretends to prophesy. He prophesied the end of the world in 1925, and, when 1925 eame and went and found the sun still up in her heavens, he explained that the Lord extended a special grace to permit the remnant of the faithful to be gathered, perhaps as a special favor of grace through Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1930 another prophecy hit the dust. Judge Rutherford went to a lot of pains to build a palace for King David to serve him when he should arrive on earth, but unfortunately the beautiful palatial residence remained untenanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His pretended interpretation of the Scriptures is infantile. For example a simple passage from the Bible:. “He was a mighty hunter before the Lord” (Gen. x, 9). Judge Rutherford with no knowledge of the original languages in which the Scripture was written, with no aid of any kind, gave the interpretation of this text as follows: “It is written of Nimrod that he was a mighty hunter before (that is, superior or greater than) the Almighty God.” [*]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We repeat again, we do not blame Judge Rutherford for his work since he is an ignorant ranter, hut we do blame those thousands who pour good American dollars into the coffers to finance a campaign of irreligion, fanaticism, and just plain nonsense.—A. J. G.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The detestable practice of solitary confinement persists in all the countries we visited, and far too often the first month has to be passed without books or work. The fan</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tastic doctrine that the prisoner is well employed in thinking over the enormity of his crime was solemnly offered to us on several occasions. Until solitary confinement can be abolished every effort should be made to obtain some means of mitigating its dangerous , effects by occupation. Its most horrible development is in dark punishment cells. We have heard of prisoners passing up to a month in such places, and of some whose eyesight has been ruined by the experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sub>:</sub>In Yugoslavia, after solitary confinement comes the second grade of imprisonment, ordinary within-th e-walls treatment; after two-fifths of the sentence has been served a freer regime is allowed. At one village we saw men at this stage, coming and going freely, with carts or on foot, like ordinary workmen, without a guard. After half the sentence prisoners are eligible for conditional liberation. This system, unfortunately, does not extend to political prisoners nor to the unfortunate sect </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">Nazarenes. These people are religious pacifists, condemned as &quot;deserters” by the military courts. As they have not been “reformed” (unless they renounce their creed) they cannot benefit by remission as the ordinary . criminals do. Moreover, when released they are liable to being sent back to the army, and the whole miserable business begins again, so that between 20 and 40 they are hardly out </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one country we heard on good authority of two recent cases where unfortunate men accused of murder were so cruelly ill-used that rather than suffer more they “confessed” with full details, and were saved from conviction only because the supposed victims turned up alive and well. One of these men suffered agonies from having the intestines inflated by a pump thrust up the anus.

<p><span class="font5">♦ To make a place in the sun for “Aryan” peasant children growing up in their land Polish politicians are making it mighty clear to the 3,150,000 Jews (ten percent of the population) that their room is better than their company, and they are making it so warm for the Hebrews that in the last few years 36,000 Jewish enterprises all over the country have had to close their doors. The persecutions are &gt;&nbsp;only less brutal than in Germany. The politicians say quite frankly that they hope to force 50,000 to emigrate monthly, and to measurably solve their economic and unemployment problems by driving all the Jews out of the country within the next few years. It is the expressed purpose of the national government not to give even a street cleaner's job to a single Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the pogrom at Brest-Lit ovsk, lasting from seven at night until ten the next morning, 22,000 Jews were at the mercy of a mob, with no protection from the police. The mob aimed at destroying the Jewish sources of livelihood, and hence, in raiding business premises, smashed everything to bits, windows, looking-glasses, sewing machines and tools. When entering a home, not an article was spared. Pictures were cut in their frames; every article of clothing, including bed clothing, was slit to ribbons. In one case, hours after the pogrom, one of the destroyers came back for his axe, but his victim did not dare report him to the police.</span></p>

The Indian usage of the term “Hindu” limits it to adherents of the Hindu religion, of which there are 200,000,000, by far the largest religious body in India, and for that reason, probably, the terms Hindu and Indian are generally used synonymously.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Inspiration from the phmons. </span><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> ‘ On J’ridtiy night 1 was not even thinking of Austria. Then suddenly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">knew that the deed and the hour was predetermined in history. I did not make the decision. It came to me. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">did not consult anyone. I gave the orders. ”—Statement by Adolf Hitler.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">This camp dealt chiefly with people who had a conviction or a faith and, for that reason, did not want to be hypocrites. At any rate, there were always reasons which were not sufficient to give these persons a decent trial. When I was there, there were also a number of prisoners who were over 60 years old. One of them was 72 years old and, aside from that, there were two blind persons in the camp—a Communist and a witness of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prisoners were separated into two divisions—“political prisoners” and “habitual criminals”. All of the above-named persons— even homosexuals—were assigned to the section for political prisoners. The political prisoners wore green, threadbare uniforms which were marked on the backs with large yellow dots. The political prisoners were placed on the right side of the camp street, and the habitual criminals or “Bevauer”, as they were called, on the left side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The professional criminals were there in “precautionary custody”. As stated by the Secret Service men and officers, the possibility of committing offense was first taken from them, through robbing them of their freedom, and, besides, they are to be frightened from doing again what violates the instructions of the Third Reich. Some of them were punished before. No hope for freedom was held out for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prisoners were compelled to work daily in the marshes. On the way to the marshes they were compelled to sing songs. Songs always had to be sung when marching, no matter whether it was inside or outside the camp. Often they had to sing while running in step. Canals arc dug in the marshes, in wider to drain them. Then the peat is shoveled into rectangular piles and left there to dry. Besides that, new streets are built. In this way the extensive peat districts of Ostfriesland are brought under cultivation and, indeed, with the sweat, with the blood—even with the life —and with the money of the prisoners. Why ? Because the prisoners have to pay for their upkeep in the camp as I had to pay for a stay in the sanitarium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prisoner has the “privilege” of paying more than two marks for every day of his stay in the camp, and if he is unable to pay, his property is taken from him as well as house furniture; and if he is entirely without mean's, he obtains emergency work and,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">from his insignificant remuneration, has to pay on a percentage basis each week, which is equivalent to extra punishment. It also happens that the parents are drawn into the matter of payment, or even other dependents who own property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He does not receive any kind of monetary or material benefits for labor performed in the concentration camp, but must pay for every’- day of his stay in the eamp for entirely inadequate food, miserable clothing, for mistreatment endured, for whippings and bodily injury; for all of this he has to pay more than 2 marks per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At times it happens that persons are employed according to their qualifications. Thus tailors have to make uniforms for the officials in the camp or for the S.S. men; also for other troop divisions. Carpenters have to make furniture—partly for the camp, partly for other officials; all without any compensation whatsoever and under threat of and use of every kind of persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While I was there the Reichstag representative, Dr. Leber, a Socialist, and his colleague, Mr. Heilmann, were also in the Esterwegen camp. Dr. Leber and I lodged together in Barrack No. 9, and I had many opportunities to converse with him. One day he and Heilmann were penned in the dog kennel, where, next, both of them were ordered to act as if they were dogs. When any of the S. S. men went past the. vicinity of the dog kennel, they—Dr. Leber and Heilmann—had to bark like dogs.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19380810_files/g_E_19380810-10.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:43pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Not satisfied with that, Heilmann was compelled to drink his own urine, and Dr. Leber was compelled to eat his own excrement. The result of this was that Dr. Leber contracted a stomach and intestinal ailment which ruined him physically. In the camp there was a Secret Service physician who, in the rarest eases, relieves prisoners with inward ailments. So also in the ease of Dr. Leber. Every novice could see, by the change of the color of the face, his state of mind, his physical breakdown and his continued condition of suffering, that these degraded methods had caused severe sickness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of this is not sufficient to satisfy the demands of the camp spirit. In addition to the daily routine are added exercises—fifty and more “bend knee” one after another; falling down on the floor and standing up again;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 10. 1038 </span><span class="font5">leaping; hopping; rolling on the ground, etc. The witnesses of Jehovah arc daily the targets for every kind of persecution, terror and vile treatment. With the use of the aforementioned means and methods, an attempt is made to force them to give up their faith in Jehovah God and His Word, the Bible. Of course, they do not get any Bibles in the camp, nor at the present time in the prisons. Attempts arc made with every possible and impossible means to force them to sign an affirmation declaring that they no longer want to be witnesses of Jehovah and that they no longer want to have any further contact and connection with Jehovah’s witnesses, and that they do not want to read any more literature of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to make them appear especially ridiculous to the other prisoners, they are called “’paradise birds”, “heaven clowns,” “Jcsus-graspers,” and, occasionally, also “Jehovah”. Those who do not yield and who maintain their faith unwaveringly carry as a sign, to make it known publicly and also because they belong to the punishment company, a yellow band below the knees. According to the opinion of the S. S. men, such are the worst traitors, the incorrigible, the offscouring of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cruelties referred to in issue No. 370 are not the only ones that are applied to them. The report-leader, Tar re, himself undertook an attack on a number of Jehovah’s witnesses in the bathing house for the prisoners. They had to undress themselves and were manipulated by Tar re personally with the splashing and jets of cold water. Cold water with special atmospheric pressure was squirted on the sex organs and on the abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this mistreatment they were continually asked if they still wanted to remain a witness of Jehovah, and they were constantly threatened with a continuation of these measures until they would agree to no longer be a Jehovah’s witness. As this admission was not made, he continued these terrible cruelties until the complete exhaustion of the victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The result of this beastly treatment was an abnormal swelling of the sex organs, combined with excruciating pain, so that finally they landed in the sanitary room. Here Tarrc daily went past and asked if they still were Jehovah’s witnesses, and threatened them with all possible other tortures, because they maintained their faith unwaveringly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">' Net </span><span class="font5">only are the blood-stopping chains pressed together on the wrists, but the fingers are also elamped together in a crooked posi-<sup>1</sup> tion. But not only were these horrible tortures repeated so long that the fingers of the martyred became crippled, which' I myself wit</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nessed—</span><span class="font5">they went even further, so that the final result was that their hands were completely paralyzed. The names of such victims can and will be made known as far as we obtain the consent of these tortured persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Hand of Jehovah God</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About fourteen days before September 28, 1935, it was announced what was to be done on this day to the witnesses of Jehovah who refused to sign the afore-mentioned affirmation. The most brutal and arbitrary measures pale into insignificance, compared with what was now to be done. They were daily threatened with “September 28-”. Even prisoners were incited to stand up against the steadfast witnesses, in order to instill dread in them from every direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But what happened then? The report-lead</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">er, </span><span class="font5">Tarr6, an arrogant and presumptuous brute who was always conjuring up new meth</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ods </span><span class="font5">of torture and which would, if possible, deprive the prisoners of any time to relax and reflect, met with an accident with a motorcycle on the afternoon of September 27. Apparently the evening of September 27 was to have been a prelude at the sound of a bugle. Such </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">prelude they liked, as this was the preliminary for greater acts which were systematically prearranged. Instead of coming into the camp, he came to the hospital. He broke his arm in the motorcycle accident. As a result, Nazidom’s support and strong arm was not in the eamp on September 28. It was the quietest day Jehovah’s witnesses had in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">camp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses were usually assigned to the most menial work. So there was also a Cesspool company to which at that time Jehovah's witnesses and Jews always were assigned. The excrement tank had to be emptied regularly with the bare hands, which, of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">course, </span><span class="font5">also caused the clothing to become soiled with excrement. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was reported to me that the Esterwegen camp was abolished some time ago. The reportleader TarrS, who was there, now lives as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">prisoner in the Dachau concentration camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As this camp is also notorious beyond </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">boundaries of Germany, Tarr6 can have a good opportunity there, to daily reflect on how bitter those cruelties are which he always himself indulged in, and also to think of how corruptly and brutally he himself had acted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, now, is the real purpose of these brutalities ¥ All of these acts </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a^%E3gof </span><span class="font5">terrorism are thoroughly predetermined and purposely performed at the command of the German government. I say “at the command of the German government’’ because the commander himself stated at the time of our discharge that this is a fact and, under threat, emphatically warned us not to divulge anything outside of the camp about the happenings in the concentration camp, as otherwise such persons are immediately again brought back to the camp; and what would then be done to them, we certainly knew ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those gruesome Inquisition methods in the camps serve the purpose, according to their own statements, to instill the prisoners with fear and terror, so that every thought of opposition against the present system will be stifled, and every thought of any kind of resistance, and every free expression of opinion, will be ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is here said may be severe, but it is the truth. But how much harder is it for the many thousands and hundreds of thousands who became victims of this gruesome maltreatment! Is it not bitter for them, when facts are disclosed, that the facts are not believed? I want to be silent about the frightful cruelties on the part of the Gestapo officials in the Gestapo cellars and cells, and the many acts*of terrorism which were committed ■ by the S.A. and tito S.S. At “Christmas”, 1935, a clergyman in a prison at Cologne said in his sermon that at the present time 2£ million persons share the same fate with us. How many must there be now, when no fewer prisons and no fewer eamps have come into existence, but just the opposite? There may be people who believe what the German government says.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The German government is aware of all the , reports about the true conditions in the German concentration camps, with the assertion in return that these are lying reports and represent atrocity propaganda of the enemy. Now what does the German government do in order </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">make its assertions appear believable and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">consolation </span><span class="font5">to justify itself in the eyes of the world V It now and then permits foreign commissions to visit a eamp. But that is at best a miserable faree and a further fraud; for these commissions never learn in this way the true state of affairs, and certainly not from the prisoners, who no doubt are questioned; for they do not risk telling the truth in the presence of their tormentors, because otherwise they would be tortured to death. I witnessed it myself as to how foreign commissions were informed that Esterwegen is only a &quot;schooling eamp” where the prisoners are taught for three months, and then when a prisoner, in ignorance of the state of affairs, though already in the camp a long time, upon being questioned by the commission, said, “I am already here twenty months,” the commander was not so likely to be embarrassed, because he, intentionally and knowingly, falsely, but with ease and self-complacency, informed the commission, by saying no, that this was an exceptional case, that he, the prisoner, really belonged to the incorrigibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same fraud was committed in regard to the food. Either there was good food the day the commission came, or a great deal of meat was carried to the prisoners’ kitch</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19380810_files/g_E_19380810-11.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:43pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">en during the camp visit; and when the commission had left the camp (with good impressions, it is to be understood), all the meat was again carried out of the camp. If the food in the camps is really as good as was told to the commissions, why does the prisoner need money in order to buy food?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If what the German government states, namely, that all the exposures about the conditions in the camps and regarding the prisons and workhouses are lies, then there is but one way that is honorable to justify the assertion of the German government, and that way is that the maltreated ones who have become known be given their freedom; that passports be given them and that in foreign countries they be granted liberty to personally refute what was reported about them. But the opposite is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' The first thing that the Gestapo did, when I was given my freedom, consisted in their taking away my passpOrt and placing me under police surveillance. Although my wife, who was a foreigner, likewise ordered and paid for a passport, it was not given to her, as I had the intention to- go to my relatives </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUQUST 10,1938 </span><span class="font5">abroad in order to recuperate. Even the money for the passport for which my wife paid was not returned to us.</span></p>

The decoys or spies are persons who </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">bought by the Gestapo, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">who by </span><span class="font5">no means are convinced representatives of National Socialism, a large percent being composed of hypocrites, which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">witnessed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">myself. </span><span class="font5">They are the paid treacherous tools </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">Gestapo who continually spy on their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fellow </span><span class="font5">men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These spies are special instruments of the Gestapo and the Third Reich. They </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are in the </span><span class="font5">camps, in the prisons, in every city </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and in </span><span class="font5">every place and are also to be found abroad. They spy on their fellow men, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">order </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to de</span><span class="font5">liver them into the inhuman hands of the Gestapo. They are a further reason that free expression of opinion and mutual confidence are vanished in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">am familiar with all these </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hazards and </span><span class="font5">intrigues and the infamous </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dealings of the </span><span class="font5">Third Reich.

<p><span class="font5">Any person with a little education may, in a few moments, ascertain that the personal name of the great Creator is Jehovah, which name He gives to himself, to indicate His purpose that only justice shall abide forever. The name occurs 6,587 times in the Scriptures, which holy men wrote at His dic-tatipn. Translators have concealed this information from the casual reader, but, even so, ' the. word Jehovah occurs four times in the King James version, and hundreds of times in combi nation words. But now one of these modern theologians, Prof. Julius A. Brewer, of the Union Theological Seminary, New York, has decided to get out a new translation, and will omit the name of the Creator altogether, using .. the appellation affected by Britain’s titled aris-toeraey in its place. Professor Brewer’s excuse for letting the Creator down to the level </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of a member </span><span class="font5">of the House of Lords is that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">name Jehovah has not been favorably accepted in American churches. ‘The threelegged milk stool for him; and the sooner, the better.

<p><span class="font5">♦ What is wrong with the church of God, that it has become so feeble, so ineffective in the world today? Our program is pedestrian; our wisdom, of this world; our Lord and Master, one whom we have reduced to our own level and domesticated. We modern men and women are gone astray in the wilderness, and our soul fainteth in us.

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE Roman Catholic Hierarchy is now strenuously pushing a campaign to in. crease religion and religionists in America; V Politicians and men^of Big Business are taking a part in that campaign, and many other persons are induced to believe that more religion is a great necessity and will constitute ’ the salvation of the country. Even some Christians have doubts, and others are asking: Should not all Christians rally to this movement and earnestly support it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All thinking persons plainly see that radicalism is increasing in America, and the sober-minded are induced to believe that such radicalism must be resisted by a religious movement. Catholics, Protestants and Jewish clergymen are in the lead in such a religious movement and are loudly proclaiming that more religion is necessary for the salvation of tiie people. It is a plain case of the blind I fading the blind, and the ditch of despair is their destiny.—Matthew 15; 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">T^he “religious campaign” that is now being put on in America is in fact a political movement, the purpose of which is to gain control of America by the forces of Home and to establish in America a totalitarian government, which will regiment all the people and compel obedience to a selfish, dictatorial power. “Catholic Action” is in fact political. A book recently published by a New York publisher, and written bv Doctor E. Bovd Barrett, entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer.</span><span class="font5"> The publisher’s introductory note thereto says: “The present great campaign which the Pope is directing in person, the campaign to win America, is the Church’s supreme and final effort to regain her ancient pre-eminence in the world.” Note that that campaign is prosecuted in the name of religion and is led by the cliief religionists on earth, and this is evidence that religion and politics work together to accomplish a selfish purpose; and by that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 10, 19S8 </span><span class="font5">means many sincere persons are deceived. Many honest and sincere persons desire to know and to serve God; and they are being taught by this religious movement and are thereby led to believe that the movement is for the purpose of bringing the people to Christ. Exactly the contrary is the purpose of that movement. The real purpose of the campaign is to unite church and state in America and to accomplish what the founders of America strenuously avoided. The uniting of church and state will mean a rule of the people the same as Italy and Germany are now ruled. This conclusion is fully supported by the words of the present Pope Pius XI, who recently said concerning the United States of America: “It is in the interest of everybody that there be a harmonious relationship between Church and State,” and that “if the civil power combines in a friendly manner with the spiritual power of the Church, it necessarily follows that both parties will greatly benefit. . . . The dignity of the State will be enhanced, and with religion as its guide there will never be a rule that is not just; while for the Church there will be a safeguard and defense which will operate to the public good of the faithful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pope then cites the “solemn Convem tion” between the Vatican and Italy, that is, the agreement made between the Vatican and Mussolini, as a clear example. Do the American people desire to be ruled as Italy is now ruled, by a military dictator?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the “religious movement” in the United States is a Catholic movement, and therefore political, note the following: “But in fact, a large proportion of Catholic Action partakes of politics, and is a political penetration, an infiltration into the political world, of a new force and agency.” (Barrett)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Catholic Church today is positively active on a scale and with an intensity of disciplined energy which is of vital concern to all thoughtful men and women who wish to know something of the great forces which are contending today for the leadership and control of the thoughts and actions of mankind. . . . That the Catholic Church is, to say the least, certainly one of the major forces of the world ... is generally admitted. Its own claim, of course, is that it is incomparably, uniquely, the supreme spiritual power in all the world.” (Catholic journal </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■No Christian can rally to and support the afore-mentioned religious movement, for the following reasons: Because such </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">movement </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">in direct violation of God's commandment to the followers of Christ; because the movement is anti-God and anti-kingdom of God under Christ and is a reproach to the name of the Almighty God; and because the movement has for its purpose the establishment in America of a “totalitarian government”, ruled by a selfish dictator, and therefore is against everything that is for God and for Christ and has for its purpose the defamation of God’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This world is visibly ruled by politics, commerce and religion, and the world is presided over and invisibly ruled by Satan the Devil as the Scriptures plainly point out. Concerning such invisible ruler it is written in the Scriptures that he is “the god of this world” and “hath blinded the minds of them which believe not”. (2 Corinthians 4:4) Of that wicked prince or ruler Jesus says: “The prince of this world . . . hath nothing in me.” (John 14:30) Furthermore the Scriptures solemnly give warning to Christians in these words: ‘Keep yourselves unspotted from the world.’ —James 1: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As stated in the foregoing quotation from the Catholic journal </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal,</span><span class="font5"> “The Catholic Church is . . . certainly one of the major forces of the world.” Being a part of the world, it is therefore a friend of the world, and hence is the enemy of God and of Christ and against God’s kingdom: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever there</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.”—James 4:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘Adultery’ in’this text means the mixing polities with what they call service to or worship of God; and which is an abomination in the sight of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religious movement is a confederacy formed between politics, religion and commerce, to rule by a dictator, and the people in general are induced to support such movement by reason of being put in fear. Jehovah God says to those who are devoted to Him, that is, all Christians: “Say ye not, A eon- &quot;• Tederacy, to all them to whom this people shall : say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.” (Isaiah 8:12,13) Then Jehovah God tells what shall be the end of that confederacy of politics, religion and commerce: “Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces: and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.”—Isaiah 8: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All Christians,<sup>1</sup>-whether associated with the Catholic or other religious organization, should take warning and therefore hold them- , selves aloof entirely from the afore-mentioned religious movement. That movement will bring disaster to everyone who supports it, for the reason that Jehovah God is against it. This is the day of Jehovah, and shortly He will destroy all those that oppose His righteous government under Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Leper Asylum of Pirapitinguf</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font5">IS a pleasure to submit the following description of the (Leper) Asylum-Colony of Pirapitinguf, in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, written in Portuguese by Dr. Oreste Guimaraes, director of the colony, and translated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once every month the Sao Paulo sound car gives two programs in the colony, where there is much interest in the Kingdom message. An organized company of Jehovah’s witnesses £ conducts evening study meetings with attendance around 20, visits the homes of the other colonists with literature and phonograph, especially using the phonograph in the hospitals for the benefit of the blind and bedridden. AV hen on the occasion of one soundcar visit on an exceedingly hot Sunday those present were asked if they were physically able to stand there in the sun for an hour to hear the program, the reply was: “We could listen all day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The management has been very kind and courteous, and when Dr. Guimaraes, the director, was asked if he would like to furnish for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> a description of the colony, he supplied the following, with the accompanying pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Asylum-Colony or Pikapiungui</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Leper colony of Pirapitinguf, S. Paulo, Brazil)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1931 the mayors of the cities of the surrounding district met in Sorocaba and resolved to devote a part of their budgets, 10 percent, to the construction of a leper colony which would receive all the sufferers from this disease then in their municipalities and thus do away with the various centers scattered about the region. At the same time the governor of the State resolved to increase the fight against the “Mal de Hansen” and enlarged . what was then the “Board of Inspection”, the present Department of Leprosy Hygiene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The site having been chosen, 180 acres in the State of Sao Paulo between Sorocaba and Itu, the construction of the Asylum-Colony of Pirapitinguf proceeded, and the first inmate was received on the 13tb of August of the same year. Little by little the Asylum was enlarged; in December 1933 there were 850 inmates, and today there arc 2,000. A few private associations have worked with the Department of Leprosy Hygiene in the erection of the asylum, limiting their field of action to assist</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">' AUGpSTfO, 1W3 </span><span class="font5">ing the families of the inmates. The first director, Dr. Manuel de Abreu, succeeded, with donations, in constructing a church and an assembly hall, buildings which today belong to the Benefit Fund of the Asylum-Colony of Pirapitinguf, an association of the patients ' for the patients and directed by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religious services are held by a Catholic chaplain, a Baptist preacher and another evangelist, all of them patients. The management has consideration for all creeds and demands respect for the same, the patients having entire liberty of choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Founded by the government of the State, which defrays its expenses, the A.'C.P. has at the present time for its maintenance and upkeep about 170 contos ($1020.00 U.S. currency) per month allotted to it in the State budget. The asylum, situated on a plateau 2,132 feet above the sea level, is 9 miles from Itu, 13 from Sorocaba, and 72 from Sao Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The patients live in fireproof houses of brick and concrete with tile roofs, the majority of which have private kitchens. These receive every two weeks, without cost, the supplies necessary for their subsistence, except bread, meat and vegetables, which are distributed daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are in good physical condition work for the asylum or for the Benefit Fund, receiving compensation according to the services rendered. The monthly pay roll to these workers is approximately 130 contos ($780 U.S. currency). Those who desire receive plots of ground to cultivate as they may choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Casino there is a library of more than 2,000 volumes, a bar where refreshments are sold, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">hall with two billiard tables, and a hall for movies and dances. Weekly, on Thursdays and Sundays, movie shows are given for the patients, the entrance requirements being former good deportment. On Saturdays the jazz band, composed of twelve of the patients, gives dances and concerts. On Sunday afternoons the Benefit Fund presents a children’s happy hour of recitations, lectures, exhibition of suitable films and distribution of sweets and appetizing refreshments. The Benefit Fund maintains day courses in reading for minors, and night courses for adults; besides a little course in gymnastics. Next year it is expected to initiate a professional course.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">On Thursdays and Sundays the patients are allowed to receive visits from their relatives and friends, who, in the reception room, remain a little apart from the patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the patients take physical exercises under the direction of a special instructor, and many practice sports such as football, basket ball, running races, etc.—Dr. Oreste Guimaraes, Int. Director.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those familiar with the Scriptures have often had their attention called to the Biblical statement regarding Adam that the “man became a living soul”. (Genesis 2: 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the newspapers say that Dr. James W. Papez, professor of anatomy at Cornell University, has located the seat of the soul. All right. What has he found? He has found that the soul is located in a ring-shaped structure in the eenter of the brain. It becomes necessary only to fit the new discovery to the Scriptures and there emerges this brilliant gem: “The Lord breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a ring-shaped structure in the center of his brain.” By the time you have untangled that one you will be ready for admission to a ringside seat at one of Pop-Eye's battles for supremacy in the field of foolishness.</span></p>

Brooks, of Christ’s Church by the Sea, Broad Channel, Long Island, New York, says that his church will continue its one weekly bingo game and that if interfered with his church will seek an injunction in a Federal court on the grounds that its religious freedom is interfered with. All over the country the nonreligious cops are having a bard time to get the religious gamblers of all denominations to stop their illegal work of corrupting the youth, but all to no avail. “The little dog laughed to see such sport, and the dish ran away with the spoon.”</span></p>

Sine§ the extra work involved in such a burial meant added expense, poorer folk usually were buried outside in the churchyard. An inscription on a tombstone, now removed, stated the case thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Here I lie outside the church door, Here I lie because I’m poor;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ New York state hospitals for the insane were under investigation. Out of 600 patients committed to Bellevue, only 50 were before the Supreme Court and only 20 of these were represented by counsel. See how easy it is to fix up a nice railroad, if you have a little influence and want to get rid of somebody? A former guard at the Rockland hospital saw a doctor spit in the face of a patient; wormy '• and spoiled food was served; attendants were ■ warned not to report perverted practices by patients. A man who engaged in 25 fights while at the hospital was let out and went home and killed a mother, daughter and roomer. The guard explained that in six years he saw the superintendent in the wards only twice. Looks as if he did not believe in inspections, does it not? and makes you wonder what the state pays him for.</span></p>

Hauling, pasteurizing, bottling and distributing are some of the imposing words used, but they do not explain. The grocers get their milk hauled, pasteurized, bottled and delivered at their doors for 9 cents a quart, and that is ample. How many bottles of milk can a milkman deliver when he has nothing else to do, and his customers are one right after another all down the street, or one door after another in the huge apartment houses?

The threat to democracy lies, in my opinion, not so much in revolutionary change achieved by force or violence. Its greatest danger comes through gradual invasion of constitutional rights with the acquiescence of an inert people; through failure to discern that constitutional government cannot survive where the rights guaranteed by the Constitution are not safeguarded even to those citizens with whose political and social views the majority may not agree.—Governor Lehman, of New York.</span></p>

Whatever the cause, the unfortunate victim of a diseased mind builds up and lives in a world of his own creation; a world contrary to truth and fact. Such a person acorns truth and derides fact and reality. And to him everyone else is lunatic, himself sane.

<p><span class="font5">May I point out that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is not beyond suspicion in this respect? She has built, and continues to build, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">world all her own, separate and distinct from</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">mittcd by diseased minds, and one wonders if that mental condition is responsible for the 100-percent bloody and criminal rule of the Hierarchy down through the centuries. Will history prove that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is controlled by a diseased mind, committing every crime in the calendar to maintain its power and prestige? The Bible answers an emphatic No! and history will echo the same. Instead of accusing the Hierarchy of having a diseased mind, Jehovah in His Word, the Bible, quotes the Hierarchy as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have made a covenant with death, and with [shrol] are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lies-</span><span class="font4">oar refuge, and under </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">falsehood</span><span class="font4"> have we hid ourselves.—Isaiah 28:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many Scriptures and ample facts, available to show that the Hierarchy is not the victim of a diseased mind, but has built its deceptive world apart and in violation of facts and truth, in order to bear oppressive rule over the Catholic population, who is her dupe. Therefore Jehovah God tells us by His &quot;Word that the Hierarchy will never be able to plead a diseased mind as an excuse for her wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bigotry's Supreme Model</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am surprised that you would mention the word bigotry. The Hierarchy is generally very choice about the words it uses, and I cannot understand how you would be so careless as to mention the ■word bigotry. Such a word might readily call to the mind of the reader (before the Jesuits get around to alter and destroy all the books that tell the truth on the subject) the wicked Papal Inquisition, with' its burnings alive, flayings, hangings and garrotings, together with the 6,000,000 or 7,000,000 that were thus tortured and slain. It might serve, to remind any<sub>t</sub>honest man of the pope’s war in Ethiopia, and the one in Spain, and which are no more than crusades in disguise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ^licrarehy know's that the word bigot carries a terrible stench with it, and for that reason she seeks to hide her bigoted, bloodlusting face behind a Franco [and his Moors], a Mussolini, a Hitler, a Duplessis, or a Roosevelt. She knows full well, frt)m past experience, that no sane man will knowingly consent to seeing her prosper politically at the expense of liberty, justice, equality and peace. Hence, to cover her bigotry, and escape alarm-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST1C, 1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ </span><span class="font5">ing honest men, she hides behind Fascism, But she cannot hide. Her works are peculiar to herself and can be distinguished by the bad odor from a great distance. As factual evidence I cite the loss of individual liberty, peace and justice in Germany, in Italy, in Franco’s Spain, in Quebec and in the United States. She cannot hide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus saith [Jehovah], Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believe th [oil him] shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet’; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[sheol]</span><span class="font4"> shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.—Isaiah 28:16-18,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hatred of Religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You accuse me of hatred, hatred of religion, I suppose, and this I fully acknowledge. Jehovah God himself hated and still hates religion, idol worship and praise of men. (Numbers 25:4; Exodus 20:4; Leviticus 26:1; Deuteronomy 5: 8) His Son Christ Jesus also hated religion, in strict obedience, to His Father’s commandment, and testified against it. (Matthew<sup>7</sup> 23:1-37) All Christians, in order to follow Christ, must hate religion also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies.—Psalm 139:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul himself acknowledged that at one time he was a religionist, but he repented and became a Christian. (Galatians 1:15) There’s a tip for you, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am also interested in your reference to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> cartoons as “grossly exaggerated caricatures”, “vaporings” and “hideous”. Truly there is not a man living, and none ever did live, who could, with pencil brush or pen, accurately portray the true extent of the hideousness of the Hierarchy and her dealings. Her hands are red with the blood of political murders, and in her skirts is found the blood of poor innocents.—Jeremiah 2: 34,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Take the Inquisition. Imagine an artist’s trying to portray in one lifetime the individual cruelties and mock trials of each one of the 7,000,000 victims of the Inquisition, or trying to paint the cruelties and baby-butcher ings of the pope-“ blessed” Franco war in Spain. You see it is impossible. I feel that the cartoonist, while doing his best, is limited by</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">YoUr statement that the Catholic population is <sup>&lt;f</sup> asleep at the switch” is not true, since untold thousands of them have read Judge Rutherford’s Bible explanations, and thousands of them have, bought Bibles, and the resulting expose of the Hierarchy has caused them to no longer call themselves Roman Catholics,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'No, it is not the Catholic people that are asleep. It is the Hierarchy itself that is ‘<sup>1</sup> asleep at the switch”, knowing not that the day of her destruction is at hand. Asleep to the prophecies of God’s sure Word, the Bible; asleep to her own precarious position among kings, dictators, rulers and mankind (Revelation 17:16); asleep to God’s judgments against her. Sleep on. Sleep on, “And I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith Jehovah.”—Jeremiah 51:39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You and Mr. Richard Felix, and the selfexalted Roman Catholic Hierarchy, seeing yourselves exposed as racketeers, are in a terrible predicament and you would like to es-, cape from it, and you think that if you could murder Judge Rutherford, and stop the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine, not to mention other literature explaining God’s Word, you would be safe. But, alackaday, it cannot be done that way. If this were not God’s work you might do so even in this “ free ” country, but this work is God’s work, and He will bring it to a close in due time.

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>The Roman Notation .</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font5">be able to read or use the Roman notation one needs to learn only seven fundamental principles :■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. The seven letters I, V, X, L, C, D, M. I equals 1, V equals 5; X equals 10, L equals 50, C equals 100, D equals 500, M equals 1,000.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. To multiply „heir value, repeat the letters, not to exceed three of a kind in a group. Examples: II equals 2, III equals 3, XX equals 20, XXX equals 30, CC equals 200, ' CCC equals 300, MM equals 2,000, MMM equals 3,000.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. V, L and D are never repeated.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">, 4. To reduce their value, precede V or X with I, L or C with X, and D or M with C. I, X and C are the only letters used to precede larger letters. Examples; IV equals 4, IX equals 9, XL equals 40, XC equals 90, CD equals 400, CM equals 900.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">5. To add to their value, succeed a letter of larger value with from one to three of less value. Examples: VI equals 6, VII equals 7, VIII equals 8, XI equals 11, XIII equals 13, XVII equals 17, LI equals 51, LV equals 55, LX equals 60, LXVIII equals 68, CI equals 101, CV equals 105, CXI equals 111, DI equals 501, DV equals 505, DLV equals 555, MC equals 1,100, MD equals 1,500, MDLXVI equals 1,566.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">6. The Roman notation is a decimal notation and therefore obeys the law of units, tens, hundreds, etc.; i.e., write units, tens, hundreds, etc., in separate groups. Example: IC equals 99 is wrong because it does not separate the 90 from the 9. It should be XCIX equals 99, (XC equals 90) plus (IX equals 9).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">7. A bar over a letter multiplies it by 1,000; 2 bars, by 1,000,000 ; 3 bars, by 1,000,000,000. Examples: V with a bar over it equals 5,000, XIX with a bar over it equals 19,000, CC with a bar over it equals 200,000, M with a bar over it equals 1,000,000, V with two bars over it equals 5,000,000, V with three bars over it equals 5,000,000,060, M with .two bars over it equals 1,000,000,000,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">There are a few exceptions to these rules. One may see IIII for 4 on a clock. Under Rule 5 is given as an example LXVIII equals 68. One might think L is being succeeded with five smaller letters; but no; see Rule 6. LX equals 60 is one group, and VIII equals 8 is another group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MMMDCCCLXXXVIII equals 3,888 is a good illustrati off using all the letters and showing how they may be grouped, MMMCMXCIX (equals 3,999) is the largest number that can be written in Roman notation without using the over bars.—Joseph B. Gillespie, Texas.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“I wish we had a tree like that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“You’d be surprised how many people do not appreciate the trees they have. Not many years ago most of the streets in this town JI were lined with large trees of one kind and v- another—maples, poplars, elms. It gave the town such a cozy, comfortable look.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“What happened to them, Jane?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One after another they were cut down. Generally it was for no reason other than that the birds lodged in them and annoyed people with their twittering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“What a shame! And some people pay hundreds of dollars to have trees planted in their yards.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'Yes, and many towns, with real civic pride, pay to have trees planted along the sidewalks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jane, do you remember that poem we learned about the poplar tree?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“1 think so. Let’s see— ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'They cut it down—the poplar tree</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whose quivering tip rose high above the rest, And every crash of falling limbs</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“We were looking at the moon,” said Buddy. “It was orange, like the sun, when it came up over the hill. Now it’s all silver. It makes that poplar tree look silver, too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Everything shines, all pretty,” said Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Mama’s flowers shine, too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 10,1?38</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Oh, a little bird!” whispered Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yessir, a hummingbird,&quot; added Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“See, Janet It’s on the petunias.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“So! Someone else has discovered the Spicy fragrance of our flowers. But not a hummingbird, though it’s no small wonder you should think so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Then what is it?” asked Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is a hawk moth; sometimes called a ladybird or a hummingbird moth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But you said moths don’t eat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“So they don’t—not Cecropia, Luna, Pro-methea, and others we’ve talked about. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font5">the hawk moth does. He has a long* proboscis, about five inches long. He drinks nectar from the flowers, just as bees do. And he also helps to carry pollen dust from one flower to another. Some flowers, with very deep cups, and others which open at night, are dependent upon the moths for fertilization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But this moth doesn’t look like the others,” Sally puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No; his body is large and heavy, while the wings are small, For that reason, the wings must go very fast to hold the body up. See how he keeps his wings moving rapidly while he is hovering over the flowers?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jane J” cried Buddy. “Look at the bright color! You can just see it sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'Yes, the hindwings are a bright rose color, but are covered most of the time by the forewings, which are beautiful in their markings, but not brillantly colored.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Bunny stooped down, as close as she dared to get. Her eager little face was tilted to one side. “I like flowers, too,” she murmured, to herself. The next moment she had tumbled over backward, surprised by a moth which almost struck her in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The hawk, or sphinx, moths are not all the same color,” explained Jane. Some of them have yellow or orange markings. Some </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">an olive green. The body and head are marked with this color, as well as the hindwings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jane, look at them!” breathed Sally. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font5">have counted at least seven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole petunia bed seemed alive with fluttering wings and slender, downy bodies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Hennery (London)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Wars and Rumors of Wars</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">E</span><span class="font5">ACH day brings its stories of yesterday’s wars with their horrors, and of destruction of life and property; and almost every day something is said by the two men, Hitler and Mussolini, who keep Europe in the fear of war, which gives another start to minds already anxious. There is a dread of war in Britain, but it cannot be said to be because of fearfulness that Britain is not strong enough to defeat an enemy’s attack, or, in attacking its enemies, it could not win through t it is fear of the terrible consequences which must follow the outbreak of war. Every sane person knows that civilization, and life and liberty, would be thrown into the melting pot; even those obsessed with the thoughts of the profits which might be gained by making the means for the destruction of their fellow men know this. But the war spirit in men, especially as now when urged on by the Devil, blinds those who have men and material at their disposal, and they gamble at any cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many in Britain who believe that if the British Government would act as calling the bluff of the dictators they could be restrained from some of those acts which bring unmeasured distress to multitudes. But neither the cultivation of the friendship of these dictators nor treating them as possible enemies .will stbp them. Anyone who is instructed by the Scriptures knows that the Devil is now busy endeavoring to push the nations to destruction. He is at war with Jehovah and His King, to his sure destruction at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Paris recently had a scare of war, and this . had its repercussions in Britain. Rumors that the German army were concentrating on the Rhine frontier, and also that there was a rupture between the government of France and Mussolini, put Paris to so much alarm as to cauae the premier to issue a statement, and to rebuke those who, for one reason or another, sought to frighten the people and hinder the government in their endeavor to bring France out of its great difficulties, financial, domestic</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and political. It is now authoritatively stated that on May 21 the French premier had before him an order for the mobilization of the French army ready for his signature. Probably it is true that the outside enemies of France are the real sources of these scares: few seem to know whence they arise, and those who do know are as silent as they are secret. The scares have an immediate effect in Britain : the money market is disturbed and some advantage is taken by those who seek to arouse the people to agree to the schemes for rearming the country and to rush the people into agreement to the necessary enormous expense. It is \ probably true that the British people are not just so easily aroused as are the French, but, then, the French people are nearer the danger line than are the people in London. War is the dominating factor at present, and Britain is being held in the grip of urgent preparations for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are those in this country who say the people of Italy and Germany do not want war, but peace. Undoubtedly the generation which so recently suffered the horrors of war, and the good and honest amongst those people, do not want war; but the youth of both sexes of those countries have had their minds set by the two dictators; they have been taught, and have come to believe, that nothing is more glorious than fighting, and sacrificing, for the national ideas and purposes which have been set before them. And it must now be accepted that the majority of the peoples of Italy and Germany are stirred by them and are ready to sacrifice Tor the glory of their country’. This factor adds very considerably to the danger of the boasting words of the two dictators, who play with the lives of the men of their countries as a financial schemer plays with the money he has managed to get invested in his schemes. A British publicist who visited Rome at the time of the Hitler visit says many amusing political stories circulate , from mouth to mouth: of course, not every- <sup>7</sup> -one agrees with the schemes of the dictators. One of the stories is that three men were sitting on a bench and one who w<sup>r</sup>as reading a new'spaper said “Teh, tch”. The second man picked up the paper, looked at it and said “Tch, tch”. The third man Tose to his feet and said: “If you fellows are going to commit the dangerous folly of talking politics, I’m off.” In Britain as yet one may give expression to his opinions without fear, but there is no ques-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tien </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that there is </span><span class="font5">a desire of some in political high places to prevent or limit criticism whether the expression be of disagreement of foreign or of home policy and action. Fascism has its lovers in this country, though few speak openly of their wish.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Franco’s Friends</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">• Hansard (Parliament’s official record), reporting the speech of Lord Glasgow in the House of Lords on Wednesday May 21, includes these words: “Some people assert that before coming to any agreement with Italy we should have insist ed-on the withdrawal of the _ Italian troops from Spain. Why should we, when they have not carried out the work .they were sent there to do?” A frank word in support of Franco’s rebellion. Franco well knows that there‘are many in the high places of Britain who are hearty supporters of his aims. The Hierarchy journals quite openly support the rebellion, and keep Franco before their readers as the champion of Christianity against anti-God Communists. The family name of the carl of Glasgow is Patrick James Boyle, and one might expect him to be a supporter of the pope, who is the “blesser” of Franco. A Labor journal gives the names of two committees who are working hard in Franco’s interests. The names are of men who are well placed for pulling political wires. It is said that Franco’s rebellion had its inception in a well-known restaurant in the Strand, London, and one member of a committee, Douglas Gerald, openly boasts of the part he played in starting the rebellion. It was he that chartered an aeroplane, and took with him , two platinum blondes (in order that it might look innocent), and sent it to the Canary Islands. This plane took Franco and Mola to Morocco to organize the rebellion. The Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font5"> of June ■§'gives the names of 18 British ships which have been bombed by Franco’s planes in Spanish ports. As yet nothing but talk has happened; the British Gov-eram ent is looking into the matter. It is more than interesting to watch the development of this ‘rebellion’; for it is the center of the three ' main instruments of Satan’s rule in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have long known that business, religion and politics have been his means of turning men from the worship of Jehovah God. These are now set in conjunction with Franco’s aims. The Hierarchy in Rome, the Devil’s chief means of bringing the world into opposition to God, especially seeks </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 10, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franco’s victory. The two dictators are helping him openly, and big commercial interests arc watching and waiting for his victory, hoping to exploit Spain as the price of their ^friendship. Spain is the Devil’s cockpit at present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord Hastings and Anglo-Catholics</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• Lord Hastings, British Foreign secretary, is a religious man. Like his father before him, he is pillar of the Anglo-Catholic party in the Church of England. As an Anglo-Catholic Lord Hastings does not take orders from the pope, but he, in common with all of that designation, considers the pope as the exalted one in the “Church”, and the visible head of “Christendom”. The pope has “blessed” Franco and has appointed his representative to Franco’s “government”. Hastings therefore would be very loath to act contrary to an expressed wish of the pope, and he too must be counted as one of Franco’s friends.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prayets for Henry VIII</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The dean of Windsor at Christchurch, Westminster, said that “choir boys of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, still receive a small payment every month for praying there for the soul of Henry VIII”. If Henry had kept in with the pope, who, in Henry’s earlier days, gave him the title of “Defender of the Faith”, he would surely have been a “saint” by this time, and candles could have been lit to him. Henry missed out when he withstood the pope. ’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">International Spying</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• It is estimated that over £30,000,000 was spent on espionage in Europe alone last year. One who has been a spy, and perhaps is one yet, says the spy “acknowledges nr loyalty; he sells his services to the highest bidder, and when he has successfully pulled off one mission, and is still in funds, it takes a very tempting offer indeed to induce him to risk his life afresh”. Surely Europe is in a bad way; lies and spies inevitably lead to general suspicion, and a lie has always been the chief instrument of the Devil,</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Note</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">• The circulation of Judge Rutherford’s booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> is causing many to feel badly. Some are sick, and some are sad, and some use words that may be considered to be the result of mental bile; many tell of the opening of their eyes and they rejoice in learning the truth; some say the booklet expresses their, own feelings about: the hypocrisy of religion and of its practitioners.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>The Parsons</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The leading lights of the various religious • systems have been having their say, and thereby disclosing how little they know about the message which the Scriptures have for this day, and to which witness is being given throughout the earth by Jehovah’s witnesses. James Black, who is styled “The Reverend Dr. James Black”, told the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland that his fear for religion is “paganism, the most deadly and soul-destroying disease of all time”. His remarks showed that he had in mind the new religion of Hitler’s Germany, where the State is the object of worship, and for whose interests one must live, and sacrifice even to death. He sees the spirit of sacrifice, and the ardent pursuit of a purpose passing from religionists to the supporters of the 'ideologies’ of the dictators, especially as manifested to the world in the rapid acceptance by the German people of worship of the State. But paganism is not anti-god in the sense religionists declare it to be. Paganism is the worship of those gods of whom Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 8:5: “For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many and lords many,).” The Greeks worshiped those mighty ones who were in the earth before the flood, “mighty men, which were of old, men of renown” (Genesis 6:4): they deified them, making them their gods. The Romans and other peoples did the same. Some gods were held to be more powerful than others. There was no supreme god. The Devil has got orthodox, dogmatic, “Christian” religionists into the same trap; for this so-called “Christian religion” has no living God, the Creator in the sense that word is used in the Scriptures. It dare not refuse Paul’s word in the above-quoted passage, “To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, . . . and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are Sail things,” but it has taken away the glory of the living God by its worship of a “trinity of Gods”, Religion as represented by the churches is much nearer paganism than the great majority of its supporters know. Out-and-out rebels against the worship of Jehovah God can be placed: they are not pagans, for they worship no gods; but religion makes profession of worship of the God.of the Bible, and has become Satan’s chief instrument for blinding the peoples about God. Organized religion has wrapped itself up in the dogma of a “trinity of Gods”: it cannot now acknowledge that this is a lie, and derogatory to God, and it will perish in its error. The truth of the glory of the Living God, and of His Son, the Savior of those who believe, and who is Jehovah’s anointed King, is now being proclaimed through the earth, and thousands are freeing themselves from the darkness and the bondage of the creeds and are entering into the service of Jehovah and Christ, proclaiming the setting up of His kingdom, and the swift coming of the judgments of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Food Storage</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The Agricultural correspondent of one of the London dailies tells of the expectation that within the next few months that government will have placed in cold storage 250,000 tons of frozen meat, equivalent to 80 shiploads, and affording a reserve supply for two months for the whole population. The feeding of the army, naVy, and air force is the immediate question; but very large quantities of wheat amd other foods have been purchased. It is now generally known that at one time during the Great War Britain was within five weeks of starvation, so destructive was the submarine terror to British shipping. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bishops</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The bishop of Liverpool, in his diocesan conference, told the parsons present that it is a “patent fact” that there is much doubt among the people about the Bible: they no longer believe it to be true as once they did. He said, “We must face the fact squarely; we must try to understand its causes.” He and his audience, if they were honest men, would not have needed to look far for reasons; for the parsons of the Church of England carry a heavy responsibility for the unbelief of the people. Both they and the clergy of the non-eonform-ist sects have loudly advertised their own infidelity. They use the Scriptures for what they can get out of them, and not as the Word of God given to guide His people into His will. They are afraid of the neglect of the Bible by the people; but their fear is because of the consequences to their business, the maintenance of their (self-appointed) position of priests. If the Bible is consciously disregarded by'the people, the parsons themselves go into the. .discard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Poplars in Moonlight—Cover Design for This Number</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE tall, erect poplars in the illustration' stand like sentinels in the moonlight, which casts a pale glow over they* abundant foliage. The crests reach more than a hundred feet upward, almost losing their outlines in the soft light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lombardy poplar, here shown, lends itself admirably to ornamental plantings and is much used for windbreaks. The nearly vertical growth of its branches give this poplar its cypress-like shape. It appears to be closely related to the black poplar, and is thought to have been native to Persia or its vicinity. From earliest times it has been known to be an inhabitant of Kashmir and the Punjab. In these countries it is favored for roadside planting, furnishing shade in the fierce heat of their summers. The tree found its way in time to the countries of southern Europe, and the name “Lombardy” poplar is derived from its abundance along the banks of the rivers of Lombardy. Its introduction into France, Britain and Germany is comparatively recent, having taken place within the last century or two. The tree is now very popular in these temperate climes, and also in America, where it serves a useful purpose even though its <sup>1 </sup>wood is of inferior quality. The chief use of the poplar is for ornament—which is by no means a contradiction in terms. As a windbreak it is most serviceable. It is possible that its more general distribution in the broad expanse of America’s middle west might have lessened considerably the damage done by dust storms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In these prairies, however, the “cottonwood” poplar is more common. Its timber, though soft and perishable, is valued by the inhabitants, as it is often the only wood available for carpentry or fuel. This tree is also common in many parts of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In-city parks the height of the Lombardy poplar, together with its dense foliage, serves to cut off from view surrounding buildings, so fostering the illusion that one is for the time away from city surroundings. Poplars generally grow quickly, and this is true of practically all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">INTIMIDATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Employing boycott, threats of violence and other coercive methods, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy tries to prevent the publication of anything that exposes its false doctrines.

They are afraid to tell the people how the Vatican is linked up with Hitler, Mussolini and Franco; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> however, is a magazine that is fearless.
