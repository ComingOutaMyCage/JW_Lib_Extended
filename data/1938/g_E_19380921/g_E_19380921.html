<p><span class="font11">■ A man went fishing, and in-bis catch^there was one outstanding fish. It was such a fine specimen that the fisherman kept it for a pet. The man and the fish became very fond of each other, and the fish used to follow the man around just like a dog. Wherever the man went the fish was sure to go, bounding along the dusty roads or skipping down the main street of the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Years went by, and then one day the two companions were strolling<sup>1</sup> across the fields. They came to a creek which was bridged by a log/The man stepped across the log and the fish followed. But the fish was overcome by a sudden fit 'of dizziness and disgust at the sight of water. He fell off the log into the creek, and in spite of all the man could do, the poor fish was drowned.—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Tit-Bits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A Dirty Story [British Joke]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ This story is about a little girl who was invited to a party of another little girl. So her mother washed her and scrubbed her. Then she dressed her in her newly laundered white dress and, while tying on the pink sash, the. mother, wbo was very strict in raising /her children right, smacked . the little girl for being fidgety and then cautioned her. “If you dirty this nice, clean dress,” she said, “I’ll kill you.” So the little girl went to the party and had icecream and cake and jello and played games, find when she got home she was all dirty. And her mother killed her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">■ The Rev. Mathews had been a guest with his family at Eph Jackson’s farm and liked the place except for the fact that the maid was untidy and the pigsty was too close to the dining-room, so that he could not enjoy the unadulterated flavor of the. fresh farm food. Upon receipt of Eph’s letter asking whether the rooms of last year be reserved, the reverend gentleman frankly gave Eph the reason for his reluctance to spend his vacation on that otherwise .excellent farm. By return mail the Rev. Mathews received Eph’s reassuring reply. “Dear Doctor,” he wrote, <sup>If</sup>Mary has went and we ain’t had no hogs on the farm since you was here last summer.”</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font1">Vaccination and Vivisection</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font11">HAVE thought many times, Of all the in-aafie things that we have advocated in . medicine, that is one of the most insane—to insist on the vaccination of children Or anybody else, for the prevention of smallpox, when, as a matter of fact, we are never able to prove that vaccination saved one man. from smallpox. Naturally not. When you have protected anybody, as we denote protection in</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">medicine, you have at the same time destroyed to all the diseases that occur. We know that</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">your evidence. If that man doesn’t take the disease against which he is supposed to be protected, how can you ever, know he would have taken it if he hadn’t been protected? We have destroyed the evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As a matter of fact, perhaps it is safe to say that not more than 10 percent of the people ever would take smallpox if sleeping in the same bed with an infected smallpox victim. We know there is a large immunity to smallpox. Very few people are subject to it, and these usually in the filthiest surroundings. Now if we carry that natural immunity to smallpox as we do to other diseases, and we have been protected by -vaccination and then we are exposed to smallpox and don’t take it, don’t you see there is no proof there? We may be carrying a natural immunity. If one case that has been successfully vaccinated afterwards develops smallpox, that is proof ' that it isn’t protection; now, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How to Get Smallpox</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">most of them recently. I have had in my own experience one very small epidemic comprising 33 cases of which 29 had ’ vaccination histories arid a good scar, and some of them vaccinated within the last year. There was no protection there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Among these was one girl who was not vaccinated, never had been, who had five cases of smallpox in the family, nursed those cases that were ill, a baby among the others, the worst case of smallpox among them, refused vaccination and was never infected at all—a natural immunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What is true of smallpox is true of every other disease. We are not all equally subject without thinking. An epidemic of influenza sweeps over the country. Why doesn’t everyone have it? The germ, if it is a germ, and we don’t know that it is, is ubiquitous. They are everywhere. You can’t hide from them. And yet perhaps but 10 percent of the population of any region will be infected. What protects the 90 percent? Natural immunity. , We may have natural immunity this year and we may not have it next year, but we can’t create it artificially by using»a so-called “immune serum”. As I say, when we do use an immune serum we have destroyed every possibility of using that ease as evidence, because we have no way of knowing whether it would ever have been infected.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">We have always recognized, the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">fl</span><span class="font11"> fact that but 15 percent of chil-H dren are subject to diphtheria, no matter how. thoroughly they are ex-</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">. A number-of years ago when we wefe just beginning to study diphtheria antitoxin minutely &lt;&nbsp;Cook County, Illinois, hospital decided to immunize one-half of the nursing staff and not the other;hajf. Diphtheria broke out soon afterwards ajnong the immunized cases, not the others.. It invaded both halves, both the immunized and the unimmunized, and the total of cases was much higher among the supposedly immunized cases than among those not immunized. We didn’t do much for those nurses. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When we took- over the management of the Philippines and all of its destinies, we announced to-the bloomin’ cockeyed world we were going to clean up smallpox in the Philippines. Well, we waited a few years, but we did make a serious effort. In fact, in a population ■ of 10,000,000 people we consummated 30,000,000 vaccinations within a period of six years. The province of Rizal, of which Manila was .the center, was the most accessible, of pourse..; the little rascals couldn’t get away 'there, we.could catch them, and did, and some • of them were vaccinated three and four and five and six times in the six years'. We were going to make it thorough. In Mindanao and some .of the -other more outlying provinces, more mountainous, we couldn’t catch the little pascals, so there . was a smaller percentage of vaccinations in the outlying districts. Rizal had to.take it. .... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>(</sub></span></p>

The death rate ran as high as 60 percent in .certain afieas where formerly it had been 10 percent<sup>;</sup> ahd 15 percent, and the. thing that climaxed the whole point was this : In Rizal we had. the highest incidence and the highest ■mortality of any part of the Archipelago.

No one wishes to deny his brother the privilege of being vaccinated if he has any 'faith in it, but here is the ridicu- -■ lous thing about it: The ones who are objecting to abolishing the law and whoare insisting on vaccination are the ones who are afraid that they, will take smallpox if their brothers -are not vaccinated. Now if you are vaccinated, you are protected, aren’t-you! What are you afraid of! Suppose, your next-door neighbor does get smallpox because he was. not vaccinated ; that is his business; he has a right to , have smallpox if he wants to; he - can’t give ' it to you. if you have been vaccinated, so what are you worrying about! Let him do as he pleases. That is all we are asking; we are not ' asking that they forbid vaccination, Let everyone have what he wants, but let us not compel those to have vaccination who know there is nothing in it, who know it is not a protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How to Get and 'Stag Sick .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is now thirty years since I have’been confining myself to the treatment of chronic diseases. During those thirty years I have ran against so many histories of little children who hadmever seen a sick day until they were vae-einated and who in the several years thht have followed .have never seen a well day since. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">J </span><span class="font11">couldn’t put my finger on the disease they have. They just weren’t strong. -Their resistance was gone, They were perfectly well before they were vaccinated. They have, never been, well .since. Now you can’t record those asfdeaths from vaccination, because, they are . still alive;; but in. England,. where statisties ' are a little more frank than they are with us, where they are kept a little, more accurately, a little more aboveboard than in this country, the ,actual official .records show three times, as many deaths directly from vaccinations as / frqm smallpox for the last twenty-one.-years. . If they record three times as many deaths, . </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">,1 </span><span class="font11">wilt guarantee you that there are three times-that many t|mt were not recorded that.are directly traceable to vaccination. That doesn’t take into account the many, many cases of encephalitis or sleeping sickness, of this or that form of degeneration, that occur as$di-rect result of vaccination. That case is s|i.Il alive. It hasn’t entered here the tnortaJrty records yet, but it is .suffering and has </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">suf</span><span class="font11">fered evpr since vaccination.. : . ■ ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It is nonsense to. think that you can inject pus—and it is usually from the pustule of the dead smallpox victim; that is the basis of it; we used to think it was from cowpox, but the manufacturers deny that and say the most reliable fonn originates in the pustule of someone who has died from smallpox—it is unthinkable that you can inject that into a little child and in any way improve its health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">There'Is No immunization</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">RVMRI What is true of vaccination is exactly as true of all forms of “serum-t—</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">/J</span><span class="font11"> immunization”, so called. There is no such thing as immunization, but we sell it under that name—immunization. We jab a needle full of pus germ, we will say the streptococcus, for instance, in attenuated form so it won’t pollute too badly, and we increase the dose or potency of that little by little until we build up what we call &quot;a resistance to it”. You can do the same thing with the rattlesnake’ venom. You can be bitten just a. little by a rattlesnake and not die, and if you are bitten often enough, you can be bitten in a vital part and not die; you have built up a resistance to the venom -of the rattlesnake, but have you improved your physique by doing so&quot; If we could by any means build up a natural resistance to disease through these artificial means, I would applaud it to the echo; but we can’t do it. The body. has its own methods of defense. <sup>y</sup> &quot;These depend on the vitality of the body at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the time. If it is vital enough it will resist all infections; if it isn’t vital enough, it Won’t; and you can’t change the vitality of the body for the better by introducing poison of any kind into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; ■ ■ • _</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&gt; I don’t like to discuss the cruelties of viviSection. I think you can all visualize' those. Don’t let any laboratory mislead you by saying these experiments are done under an an-‘ esthetic. Their own recital of their experiments proves that an anesthetic could nothSve been used in most of the cases, because they’are of such a nature that the animal has to be under observation in a mutilated condition sometimes.for weeks, until it dies. It ean’t'Tive under the anesthetic. That is a matter- for a very few minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Insanities of Vivisection -</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Aside from the horrible cruelties that the thing entails, I have not been able to diseoveritin thirty years painful and careful search one ,&lt;athing of practical utility that has been adduced in all this time from vivisection. To be sure, we have learned much of the processes of the animal, but after we have learned the utmost of the animal’s processes we Still have only the processes of the animal. We are not sure they are very closely related to those of the human. But if they paralleled the human reactions exactly, what has this led to in the way of curative treatment! ^3ur results are exactly zero, and always will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I can hear somebody objecting to insulin. They say, “Hasn’t insulin benefited diabetes!” Why, of course; of course it has, but has it prolonged the life of the diabetic! As Al Smith says, let us look at the record. Diabetes has been on a percentage increase ever since we knew what diabetes is. That rate of increase has been maintained in exactly the same ratio since we introduced insulin as before. We have not prolonged the life of the diabetic. We have .allowed him to carry on in a little better flesh, a little better strength, blit acidosis or starvation gets him in the end just as surely; and at about the time he would have died otherwise. This must necessarily be true or We would show a decline in mortality in diabetes; and we do not. There is a percentage increase every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of course, we have those occasional cases that die from insulin shock or hyperglycemia. We have over-insulinized the patient and he goes out through quick collapse. If we get busy, open a vein and introduce glucose or pour some orange juice into him quickly, sometimes we can get him out of tflat shock, and sometimes we can’t..So we have those occasional accidents that have swelled our„ total mortality statistics by a little. -, I cannot think of one thing of practical utility that has evolved from all of our years of crucifixion of 500,000 dogs a year. If it is a cruel practice; and if there is nothing but inutility behind it, if it can’t show anything of real importance looking toward 'the improvement in health or-the lengthening of life, then in heaven’s name why do we maintain it! I suppose it is safe to say that Pot 'one percent of the vivisection that is done today would be classed as useful research. It is admitted that 90 percent of it is for demonstration only — demonstration to medical students. It is impressive, but not very instructive. When going through lectures many, many years ago, we paid very little attention to the work of the physiological laboratory; it was of academic interest but we didn’t attend it very regularly. We saw the dogs crucified without anesthetics. It wasn’t pleasant, and the result was nothing that left a good impression behind or any useful information whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Work of Fiend?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I just want to tell you of one experiment that seems to me one Vj ®BB^ of the most cruel things I ever heard of. A dog’s side was opened and the heart was pulled out into the wound where it could be manipulated. A clamp was put on the coronary artery so that when they pulled a wire, they shut off the circulation in the artery. The dog couldn’t tell there was pain there, but he cried. That is evidence that he was in great pain. Every time they would pull .the string and shut off the blood, the dog would cry. What did that prove? It proved just what we have always known, that there is a type of angina that is caused by interference with the coronary circulation. We knew it before. What did that teach? Post-mortem showed us in death from angina we usually found an embolized artery —the artery was plugged with a clot. It dilated rapidly and usually ruptured—angina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now from all this experimenting, from this intimate study of the mechanism of angina, what has developed? Can we do anything for angina today that they couldn’t do when Noah was a small boy? If there is anything done for it, I uon’t know it. We use, the nitrates to give relief from the pain; we dilate the arteries and it eases up the tension and there is a little less pain for an hour or two; and then-we do it over again. .That doesn’t cure anything. In the back of our heads all the time is that death certificate. We know here is a.case of angina; we don’t know why he had it; we may know it is an embolism, but we don’t know why the embolism occurred. We don’t know what to do to prevent another embolism, and we can’t do anything to clear up this one; sO we wait with very dismal forebodings for the next attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That, is not very constructive treatment, and since we mutilated these dogs we haven’t been able to do any more to relieve angina than before. That is merely an illustration of what research leads us to through vivisection. That is only one illustration. Vivisection has been entirely impractical as far as any benefit to the human race is Concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is a great hue and cry every time a bill is presented mak- i<sub>n</sub>g tor the abolishment or even a </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">_</span><span class="font11"> marked restriction of the cruelties ” ™ &quot;m <sub>o</sub>f vivisection. The vivisectors want a free hand; they want to be able to decide what manlier of experiment they perform and be their own judges as to whether an anesthetic shall be used or not, and they want the snooping public completely excluded from their laboratories. They have that. They have the permission to do certain experiments. They presume to do many others for which they were not granted permission, and they are rather naive, I’ think, when they recite at great length many other experiments that they were not supposed to have performed; but there is their record in black and white. The result of that is that when a bill is introduced asking for the abolishment of vivisection, the most eminent men in medicine are rounded up and hurled into that committee meeting to recite the wonderful achievements of research. I wish I knew what they were. I have never seen them, and I believe I have been a rather close student of research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cowards Always Fear Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A few years ago, when a bill was offered to Congress—I don’t remember its number or its name, but it was for the abolishment of vivisection of dogs in the District — it had great difficulty getting&quot; through the House Committee. The friends became rather impatient and they presented an identical bill before the Senate. This was heard in full committee. I had appeared at the re-hearing before. the Congressional committee, but there., was nobody there to give me any argument. This was a hearing of the proponents. The opponents were heard later. I felt that I was wasting time. When they asked me to go down for the hearing before the Senate Committee I telegraphed back: ‘T have hitherto wasted time. Have the heads of the three laboratories of Washington present or I won’t go down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Well, they were present and their personnel with them. They packed the committee room. There I had them on the other side of</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the table. Senator Capper was presiding. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">asked permission to allow these men to stop me and heckle me and demand proof of everything that I said, and I promised that the proof would be forthcoming. I told the truth without gloves and there wasn’t one of these men that peeped. If I had said anything that he could have challenged, wouldn’t he have been on his feet instantly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Unfortunately, the Senate rose before that bill was reported. It didn’t even reach consideration in the committee; the house bill was reported out favorably, but it never will be heard on the floor; it never will be discussed. It is always blocked whenever anyone proposes to bring it up, and it always will be. There is a powerful medical lobby that looks after that. They don’t want the facts of vivisection to get before the public. They will not discuss them in public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I have appeared several times ,before in public addresses on this subject, and at each one of these it was advertised as a debate between some member of the county society or the academy of medicine of the city and myself. I always knew it would not be a debate, and it never was. Always, every man invited to present the other side had a perfectly good alibi. He never came. They don’t dare debate the subject before the public.—William Howard Hay, M.D., in an address at Washington, D. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">C.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>“Nature’s Own Food Metal” (?)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">a</span><span class="font11"> THERE is no question that there are infinitesimal quantities of aluminum in practically everything that grows. An excessive amount is found in rayless goldenrod or snakeroot. It has been found that when animals eat either of these two herbs they soon contract a disease known as “trembles”. If milk contains much of this poison it results in milk sickness. When food animals, like rabbits, are eaten, persons also become affected with trembles, a paralytic condition. The animals themselves become diseased with the eating of the herbs, contracting trembles. The symptom—they are unable to use their hind legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We now have a new disease known as radium poisoning. It was discovered that radium could be used on watch and clock dials to make them luminous in the dark. The workers were affected with a disease that caused them to lose their power of locomotion,, sort of a jsemi-paralytic condition. In short time they were unable to move hand or foot. They had to be cared for as infants. Twenty of those working for the U. S. Radium Corporation of New Jersey have already died, and the others are simply hopeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now a new case has occurred at the Ottawa, Ill., factory. Eight of these have died, and the ,others are condemned to a living death of paralysis known as radium poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many persons who have been given another luminous metal, called mercury, for the treatment of various diseases. When taken as a cathartic with something sour it eats out and destroys the peridental membrane (tissue surrounding the teeth), the patient having what is termed “salivation”, terminating in pyorrhea, focal infection—death. When taken internally for the treatment of syphilis the meta! destroys the periosteum surrounding the joints. When this dissolves, locomotor ataxia is the name given to the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now we find aluminum belongs to this luminous class of metals. It has twice the potency of silver nitrate, and, therefore, has been chosen above that metal to be used upon the new million-dollar eye of the Mount Palomar Observatory. It sifts out many of the atmospheric rays which silver does not affect. It is also extensively used for boudoirs and other mirror purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We find that aluminum has the distinction of also belonging to the heavy metal series which is soft and poisonous. Among these, we find it is similar to lead, bismuth, arsenic, zinc, tin, copper, etc. The quantities necessary for a lethal dose of lead poisoning is often so small it is unmeasurable. It is hard to believe that anyone would suggest that arsenic is not poisonous. We certainly know that verdigris will form on copper when in contact with acetic acid, sufficient to cause death within 24 hours. Zinc poison is said tq be so harmful that government warnings have been issued that galvanized pails should not be used in connection with milk on the farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Aluminum belongs to the series, also dissolves when in contact with all foods, as they contain both the acids and alkalis; both dissolve aluminum. When these particles enter the alimentary canal they come in contact with acids and peptic ferments of the body,-consequently, we find, when they are in contact with these juices, various poisons are produced, such as aluminum acetate, aluminum muriate, aluminum sulphate, aluminum chlorate. These are the principal chemicals used by morticians for embalming the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Aluminum, having a high potency, is known as a catalytic agent, being used by sugar refineries to produce the crystals known as white granulated sugar. When it comes in contact with the juices in the gall bladder or kidneys the little crystals formed produce what is known as bodies, gallstones, kidney stones, etc. Many go to the physician regularly to have their gal) bladder drained, something unknown twenty-five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The general health of the nation is such that the gov irnment itself has become alarmed. The department of health claims that our illness bill per annum now reaches ten billion dollars; that approximately 3 percent of our population is totally incapacitated; that 90 pereeiit of adults need medical care; 80 percent of our' school children are undernourished and need medical and dental care; that we are now operating five billion dollars’ worth of Hospitals at a cost of three million dollars per-day; that an average of one out of each twelve persons spends an average of ten days per annum in some hospital. Such a condition was unknown before aluminum cooking utensils were placed in our homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Large federations of women’s clubs are now for the first time becoming wide awake as to the danger pf aluminum. Why should this metal be accepted as non-poisonous when all others are in the oxide form when ingested? This should not be just because someone makes money from its sale.—Dr. C. T. Bette, Ohio.</span></p>

It consists of boiled wheat, chopped nuts, raisins, pastrami, sesame seeds and fine colored sugar. The mixture is all right of itself, but becomes &quot;a la cemetery” by being prepared in an aluminum pot and left to stand therein. At least that is what was discovered at Fitchburg.

In some instances there were eight to twelve cases for the doctors in a single family. Business was good, and the doctors cannot be blamed (perhaps) for failing to consider the aluminum angle. The more food that is cooked and stored in aluminum, the better the doctor business. However, there are honest physicians, and they tell their patients to dodge the cemetery goods.

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>A “Strange Work”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">♦ It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to salute or serve flags and other images, tip hats to their women or buildings, because. of the 1st and 2nd Commandments of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses are proclaiming God’s name, Jehovah, in al] the earth, that His name may be vindicated to all creation, proving Satan is a liar. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses are giving more glory to Jehovah God, the Creator, than to Christ Jesus, the Creature. They have no God but Jehovah,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses are proclaiming that Jesus Christ has come again and is setting up His kingdom in the earth in the midst of His enemies and breaking in pieces all the nations of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">It is </span><span class="font11">strange, Jehovah’s witnesses have separated themselves from all the religious denominations of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses take a bold stand against religion and expose all religious doctrines as false and of the tradition and precepts of man, not of the Bible, but fathered by Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses are hated by all the religious element, just as Jesus and the apostles were hated by the religious leaders and followers of the Jewish religion, yet the religionists profess to be of the same God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses make this bold statement to all nations and peoples: That all present governments and religions of this world will perish for ever because of ■ Jehovah’s wrath, for they have broken the everlasting covenant, changed the ordinance and not kept the laws of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses gladly proclaim that the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ Jesus is the only hope of this old sick, dying world and that the people of good will toward God may find comfort and safety and learn the purpose of Jehovah toward His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses go from door to door and house to house and use other means such as radio and phonograph with the Kingdom message and warning of Jehovah’s vengeance, without a permit from man, and gladly face death, persecution, threats, and serve time in jail, that their fellow man may receive the truth and take his stand on Jehovah’s side and live, or on the Devil’s side and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is strange, Jehovah’s witnesses give all credit to Jehovah, that He, through Christ Jesus, is directing all their movements in their service of the Kingdom and that it is not the work of any man, but the fulfillment of the following prophecy: ‘For the Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim, He shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do His work, His strange work; and bring to pass His aet, His strange act.’ (Isaiah 28:21) ‘Therefore wait ye upon me, jaith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, and assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.’ (Zephaniah 3:8)— J. Winger, in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jersey Observer.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Connecticut Returning to the Union</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Through action of municipal officials egged on by religionists the state of Connecticut has been well on the way towards a complete divorce from the principles of religious freedom and freedom of speech and press. There were 134 convictions of Jehovah’s witness^ entered in police courts in. a number of communities in a short space of time. Priests, Knights of Columbus, Irish cops, and prominent ‘principals of the flocks’, all joined in the effort to suppress and censor the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font11"> and the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Appeals were taken from all of the 134 convictions. Of these appeals, 128 were in Hartford County, which is blessed with a state’s attorney, Hugh M. Alcorn by name, who has a reputation fox honesty, integrity and fearlessness second to none. Alcorn didn’t approve the prosecutions, and entered a nolle prosequi as to each of the 128 eases. This included the case of Louis Garloni, divisional servant, who received a $25 fine for sending a letter of information to officials in the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Although in the past few months 212 of Jehovah’s witnesses were placed under arrest in the state, to this date not one of them has paid a fine or spent a night in jail.</span></p>

The Monessen </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Indc-pf.'iida^t</span><span class="font11"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sweeping civil liberties decision of the United States Supreme Court in t.hc Jehovah’s witnesses suit should be sufficient to satisfy those who have taken special interest in the persecution of'' members of Ibis religious sect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">-. Monessen had a sad experience—it was costly, non-profitable, anil held the city up to ridicule while it was going on. The United States Supreme Court ruled that to interfere with this sect in the distribution of literature in municipalities where ordinances were used to stop them, would be to strike a blow at the freedom of the press and free speech. The Court in its decision said that legislation of this type would restore the system of license and censtjrshij) in its baldest form. The Court added that press freedom was not confined to newspapers and periodicals, but other sources had thcsanie rights under the law as newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The freedom of religion and the rights of all citizens under the American Constitution to worship as they see fit is a right that the courts have not yet abridged, and while occasionally it is necessary to put up a. fight to sustain this Constitutional right, yet these opportunities come and it must be gratifying' that the high courts continue to curb, official acts of those who would place in the way an obstruction to free speech, free press, or free-' dom of religious convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And thus the fresh air of freedom sends its soft and gentle breezes over the land. Tn the darkened Fascist areas of New’ Jersey, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and other places, Jehovah’s witnesses now carry the Kingdom message to the people without much opposition by the' strong-arm squads. Does this mean that the religionists have given up and are going to be good ? It is doubtful. z\s soon as they can recover from the shock they will undoubtedly again ineubate new charges in their vain attempts to stifle and- smother the truth. They-do not want liberty, except the liberty to prey upon the people, and must therefore receive proper education when the Ford Jehovah cleans up the mess in Armageddon. <sup>:</sup></span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Petition Massachusetts for Liberty</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">. Parents of five children (Jehovah’s witnesses) living in the state of Massachusetts petitioned the school * committee of Sudbury Center, De* w- eember 27, 1937, to reinstate the pupils in the public schools and thus restore freedom to worship Almighty God in Massachusetts. This necessity is enough to make the Pilgrim Fathers turn over in their graves. Warning the committee of its responsibility if it continues to deprive the children of God-fearing and patriotic parents of the rights guaranteed them by the Constitution, it said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You will (thus) continue to besmirch and degrade the emblem of the Republic which,you insist children shall revere. You will also continue to contradict the fundamental law of the Republic, as well as of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Instead you will uphold and strengthen the hands of those who are trying to enforce in this country pernicious and alien doctrines which now serve to grind in the dust millions of defenseless mortals in those modern Communistic and Fascistie states overseas.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ Not only has radio become a thing of great public interest, but it is definitely a household convenience and necessity. From early morning to late at night the radio is to the average home a center of contact with all phases of life. During the course of the day one hears much that is not worth hearing, but also sopie things that are of practical value. The most important thing anyone can hear anywhere at anytime is the good news that soon Jehovah’s kingdom will for ever end the Devil’s present evil world and bring the heart’s desire of all honest people, to the vindication of His own great name. Many of the Lord’s “other sheep” are hearing this message from the Watchtower station WBBR, in Brooklyn. The noble purpose of this sta-■ tion stands as a fiery condemnation of all commercial radio that has no time for the Kingdom message.. Are you listening?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ Nothing else on earth is so mean, so small, so vicious as a mean, small, vicious woman. In Texas a woman left her husband and child because both are Jehovah’s witnesses. The woman married again, which was a godsend to her ex-husband, but she maneuvered a court decision that her charming and intelligent 12-year-old child should be taken away from her father and put in an institution. A higher court reversed the decision and gave the child back to her father. The woman in the case had sought to make capital out of the fact that the child put God above -the flag. The judge of the higher court said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. . . Does the admitted refusal of the father and daughter to salute the flag of the United States because they think such act manifests a reverence that would violate the religious creed upon their fidelity to which, they believe, depends their future salvation, furnish convincing proof? History is replete with the bigotry, intolerance and dogmatism of religious sects and the pages thereof are strewn with martyrs who died for their faith , , .</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">There can be no true national life in our democracy unless we give unqualified recognition to freedom of religious worship and freedom of education. My prayer shall be that this nation, under God, may vindicate through all coming time the sanctity of the right of all within our borders to the free exercise of religion according to the dictate of conscience. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How any man could write a thing like that and refuse to answer Judge Rutherford’s letter calling attention to over 1,000 cases of persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by the very organization that owns the cathedral in which his letter was read is something that only a politician could understand. While politicians continue to mouth glittering platitudes, their henchmen, the clergy, are absolutely intolerant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Have, Been Ashamed</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ After the deal he gave Jehovah’s witnesses on their petitions, President Roosevelt should have been ashamed to write to the “Most Reverend” Francis J. L.

After a six hours’ fight to land at Camden, and later at Newark, the plane finally landed at Hartford, Connecticut, some 340 miles from its intended destination, and in the opposite direction.

The drop occupied 2 minutes 20 seconds, and was made at the average speed of 134 miles per hour, He was able to breathe normally, move his arms and legs without difficulty, and by using his hands as fins was able to alter the course of his fall.

This is sometimes re-enforced by the state guards of an obliging governor. (The taxpayers of'Ohio must dig up $60,000 to pay state guard expenses in helping Tom Girdler break the strike in Little Steel.) Before the World War European countries did not consider strikebreaking a part of police duty. In the half century before the World War not as many strikers were killed by the police forces of Belgium, Denmark, France, Gennady, Holland, Italy, Norway and Sweden as were killed in the Memorial Day massacre by a small part of Chicago’s police force.

<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Pure Worship</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font11">N ORDER to appreciate what constitutes pure worship, as defined in the Scriptures, the clear distinction between religion and Christianity must be made. Those who practice religion indulge in a form of worship whereby they appear to be pious, and which appearance is made manifest to be seen of men. One’s appearance before men does not reach as high as God and receive His approval. The 'cribes and Pharisees were religionists and indulged in a form of worship, and concerning them Jesus said: “But all their works they do for to be seen of men; they make broad their phylacteries, ana enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.” —Matthew 23:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Paul was a religionist before he became a Christian, and he says of those who practiced religion that they ‘have a form of worship but deny the power of God'. (2 Timothy 3: 5) By the practice of religious forms the Word of God is set aside and made void, and for that reason Jesus told the Pharisees that they were hypocrites and that their form of worship was in vain, hence disapproved by Jehovah God.—Matthew 15:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Pure worship means to strictly obey God’s commandments by doing what He has commanded shall be done, even as Jesus likewise does. The followers of Christ Jesus were and are called “Christians” because they do the same things that He did. They do not need to wear a peculiar kind of hat or a long robe or lace pants and go through certain contortions, to indulge in a pure worship. Such is done at the instruction of man, and it is foolishness in the sight of God. True worshipers do not need to make a show of themselves before men. They seek only the Lord’s approval. In harmony with what is here said it is recorded, according to the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Syriac Version,</span><span class="font11"> at James 1:27 the following: “For the worship that is pure and holy before </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font11">the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, and that one keep himself unspotted from the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah God is the fountain of life. (Psalm 36:9) God has appointed Christ Jesus to administer life to those who obey Him, and therefore it is written that 'the gift of God is life everlasting through Christ Jesus our Lord’. (Romaim 6:23) For this reason Jesus is called “the Everlasting Father” (Isaiah 9:6), who administers life to those who obey God’s commandments. The “fatherless” are those who have no knowledge of and have not learned the way to life, even though they greatly desire to know what is that way. Concerning this Jesus says: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) If they hear the message concerning Jehovah and His King and kingdom pointing the way' to life, that is a comfort to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As recorded in the Scriptures, Jehovah God is the Husband of Zion, sometimes called Jerusalem, which is symbolized by a woman and means God’s organization. (Isaiah 541-9) When one is in distress and affliction and hears the message of truth, it is a '’(insolation to him..</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A widow is one who has no husband. All the nations that practice what is called “the Christian religion” call themselves collectively “Christendom”. Instead of indulging in pure worship of God they substitute therefor religious practices. Their organization, such particularly as the Roman Catholic organization through its Hierarchy, claims to have God as its Husband and Head, but the Scriptures plainly state that God has rejected and turned away from Him all such religionists and, further, that He receives and approves only those who “worship him in spirit and in truth”. (John 4:24) All the religious organizations of “Christendom”, therefore, are widows within the meaning of the Scriptures, Within their ranks or organization, however, there are sincere persons who have been brought into such organizations, and to whom also the word “widow” applies, because they rely upon the organization to lead them. They have not been taught the truth of God’s Word, and because they have to feed upon the traditions or teachings of men they mourn and are in great affliction, and of them God’s prophet'says:‘They</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">sigh and ery because of the abominations that be done in the midst of her,’ that is, within the religious organization.—Ezekiel 9:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">God commands Christians, that is, those who worship Him in spirit and in truth, who reiy upon and obey His commandments, that these must go to such persons as desire to be comforted, and give them the message of truth set forth in God's Word, dh'at they may receive consolation. (Isaiah 61:1,2) When one who is consecrated to the Lord obeys this commandment of Jehovah, such constitutes pure and holy worship of God. To those who are true followers of Christ Jesus the Lord God now specifically says: ‘Go through the midst of “Christendom” (that is, her organizations) and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst of her,’ (Ezekiel 9:4) To set a mark on their foreheads means to give such persons an opportunity to learn what is taught in the Word of God, the Bible. These honest and sincere persons who sigh and cry because they see the religious systems indulging in polities and all unrighteous things kno.w that such practices of the, religious institutions are wrong, and they sigh because thereof and they desire that which is righteous. They are called “people of good will”, yet they do not know God’s manner of salvation and they too are suffering affliction even as the “fatherless”. The true worshipers are commanded to go to such and comfort them by presenting to them the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Therefore it is written, in James 1: 27, that pure worship is to visit those persons thus described as widows and fatherless and to comfort them. Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to God’s command, do go from house to house throughout the land called “Christendom” and call attention of the people to the good news of the Kingdom and inform them of these truths, that they may learn the way to life. This they do by presenting to them the message by phonograph and the message contained in books, and encourage them to hear and to read, that, they may understand the truth. Such witnesses, therefore, are indulging in pure and holy worship in obedience to God’s commandment. They do not need to indulge in any forms of ceremony, and therefore they go about in their usual garments. They are not parading themselves to be seen of men: but their sole purpose, in obedience to God’s commandment, is to comfort those who desire to know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Religion originated with Satan and is put forth by him for the very purpose of keeping the people in ignorance of God’s means of salvation and blessing. Satan endeavors to destroy the human race, and religion is one of his subtle means to accomplish that wicked purpose. ‘Pure and holy worship’ is exactly opposite to religion, because those who thus worship in obedience to God’s commandments do so by carrying ;he truth to others. The truth of God’s Word enables a person to get free from the blindness induced by Satan’s frauds. Thus released and coming into freedom, the people receive comfort and joy. To be joyful such people must be obedient to the Lord. They must abandon religion and must indulge in the true worship of Almighty God and Christ Jesus, looking to the kingdom which is now at hand for the blessing;.: of everlasting life. At James 1: 27 also appear the words concerning pure worship that one must, “keep himself unspotted from the world”. The explanation of this part of the text will appear in the next issue of this magazine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Romanism, like its counterpart, Hindooism, is a religion of sex worship. Hindooism is based on sex gratification; Romanism on sex repression. Under the misleading name of “Virginity”, the Church of Rome has capitalized the false notion that the instinct of procreation is, in itself, the greatest foe to spiritual advancement, and should be crushed out of existence. The whole theory of virginity rests on a solid foundation of ignorance of man’s physical nature, and has given rise to some sad results, The very fact that something is prohibited adds immeasurably to its attractiveness. [P. 55]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A girl in a convent is not free to even communicate with her own parents. Her mail, like that of prisoners in any other penitentiary, is censored, and, if necessary, mutilated before she gets it, if she gets it at all. The girl in the convent is in a pitiful quandary, for to even own up that she had all she wanted of Christ’s spouse is to put herself on the spot. She automatically becomes her own accuser. She says to the petrified superior that she is no longer in love with Jesus Christ, not at least to the extent of wanting to marry Him. She is guilty of spiritual breach of promise. A monster of iniquity, a child of the Devil, yellow to the core. She can leave, of course; no one is wanted in the convent but those who love Jesus. If she wants to turn Him down, she can. It is nobody’s business but her own. If she wants to return to her people branded a yellow renegade, she can. They will give her back her clothes and open the gate. She was only a fraud anyway. Good riddance to bad rubbish. She is in the pillory. How many girls want freedom enough to ask it at such a price? The girl who leaves the convent is in the position of a soldier who has been drummed out of the army, [P. 59] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ Some idea cf the fright that has overcome the Hierarchy and its male chambermaid may bh gathered from the first paragraph of the following article, which has been carried by Catholic papers to all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rutherford Makes Former Anti-Cathoijc Groups “Look Like Pikers’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chicago.— (Special) —Charles P. Windle, non-Catholic editor of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Iconoclast,</span><span class="font11"> Chicago, asserts that “Judge” Rutherford, through his seet known as “Jehovah’s witnesses,” is distributing more than 10,000,000 books, magazines, and pamphlets every month. His 35,000 “Witnesses” make house-to-house canvasses, play Rutherford records on portable phonographs, operate sound trucks, and conduct study clubs and meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Windle says that Rutherford is “arousing anti-Catholic prejudice on a scale that makes former anti-Catholic movements look like pikers. Ninety per cent of his material is viciously anti-Catholic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">, Father J. S. Feldmeier of Braddpck, Pa., in a statement sent to Windle, tells how the Witnesses went to Aliquippa a few years ago with a loudspeaker and set it up on a hillside, whence they played records damning the Church and priesthood. Afterwards, they combed the town distributing pamphlets and seeking donations: He says that there are many fallen - away Catholics among their workers. One man was a trustee and wonderful worker in Father Feldmeier’s church in Sagamore. He quit the Church and began to ridicule it, as a result of the Witnesses’ work. He forbade his children; daily communicants, to go to church. The mother had one new baby baptized secretly, but in order to keep peace in the family followed her husband before the next was born. A girl of the family died and had the ministrations of, the priest. Her father threatened to kill the priest if she were taken to the church at the funeral and two policemen ■were necessary to handle him in a car in front of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“In Aliquippa they have gotten about 20 families, children and all in about a half year’s time. In Sagamore they took away about 15 families in a short time.” Father Feldmeier says that he knows of 100 apostasies they have caused. “It is high time that we Catholics wake up and do something about it.”—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Telegraph-Register.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The very terror of the Hierarchy, their inability to debate their doctrines, and their never-ending flood of abuse, is proof of the error in which they are wallowing and of their coming destruction.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">♦ American neutrality in Spain works only one way, that is, in behalf of the army of ba by-killers and not in behalf of the Spanish Government. In a very righteous order it is decreed that no arms may be shipped to Spain because this country is neutral, but in March 20,000 airplane bombs were loaded on a German freighter in the Delaware River, and, by this time, no doubt many of them have killed more babies and women in the Hierarchy’s war to make Spain safe for Fascism. The Spanish embargo was rushed through Congress while Secretary of State Hull and his present undersecretary, Sumner Welles, were absent from the United States. Secretary Hull considers the embargo the greatest foreign policy blunder of the Administration.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Helping to Destroy Spain</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">♦ It is a fact that the embargo policy was slipped through while both Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles were out of the country; it is also a fact that the policy is in outrageous violation of both our immediate national interests and our traditional attitude and treaty commitments; it is further true that the policy of embargo on the export of munitions to Spain is a Congressional policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The “non-intervention” policy in Spain was a British policy, and Roosevelt went along with it. This policy had the added element of being popular with an influential Catholic group in this country and of chiming with the general public ..impulse to keep out of European entanglements. Moreover, there is little reason to feel that it stood in the way of a profitable war trade with the Spanish rebels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some time ago i met in Washington one of Franco’s purchasing agents. ITe told me that our embassy at Paris had been most obliging and helpful as soon as they realized that he carried credentials from General Franco to the Du Ponts. He said, with a smile, that he was buying “dye-stuffs” from the Du Ponts, so I asked him how he spelled “die-stuffs”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the meantime the Spanish republic is being effectively murdered, and I gue.sg that Secretary<sup>7</sup> Hull’s anger at those columnists who criticized the inconsistency.of his policy flows from the realization that our Government has let itself be out-maneuvered into a position where we are forced to stand by and wrteh the destruction of European democracy. — Jay</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ When International Murderers learned that 2,500 tons of aerial bombs had been shipped to Germany from Wilmington. Delaware, on May 11, 1938, they were delighted. They hoped that the bombs would be used to murder more babies in Spain and slaughter the mothers, standing in line at relief stations in the same unhappy country to get food for their families. Some agent of the head murderer should certainly have “blessed” those bombs before they were sent on the errand of murder which be so much approves, and which, in the case of Spain, would lag without his words of comfort, encouragement and inspiration.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Archbishop Duhig, in an address at Coolangatta, Australia, said that it was hard to distinguish the sex by the dress of young people, and then, in the same paper, namely, the Brisbane </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Courier Mail,</span><span class="font11"> there was a picture of him in a lace dress and 13 other girls, two of them in black, with white bibs, and eleven all in white, which showed that he knew what he was talking about. Duhig is wrong, however, if he thinks he is any longer young. The bishop is of the shape of a rain barrel. He is identified by the hat of Dagon, the fish god. There was a young fellow in'the picture who might have been quite good-looking if he had taken off his lace dress and put on pants. It is hard for anybody who is pear-shaped to try to put his hand over his heart in a holy manner and get away with it, especially if he has a mug that would stop a town clock.</span></p>

However, in its official half-yearly index the magazine sagaciously omitted all subjects dealing with the Catholic Church.

<p><span class="font11">So is it for compulsory flag salutes in schools. The lifting of the hand and muttered words do not comprise the real salute to the flag. The real salute takes place in the heart. Forcing children to go through a mechanical procedure of salute against their will will not inculcate patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Let the children be taught American ideals and American traditions. Let them be told the story of our Constitution.

All this by way of introduction to the story that in Brooklyn an attractive 26-year-old girl informed a cop he could go there, when, according to American cop usage (but not according to British cop usage), he bawled her out for persisting in blowing her automobile horn at a crowded street intersection. The cop was offended when a nice-looking young girl informed him of what might be his destination; so he had her arrested for disorderly conduct. The magistrate on the bench had a sense of humor; so he ruled that the young lady’s remark was neither a command nor a wish, but a statement of fact. But the cop had the best of the situation in the end; for he had the young lady arrested some more, this time for alleged traffic violation. Not sure if he had her arrested afterwards for being an American, or not being a man, or for having a different religion than he, or what. Anyway, he knows where he can go.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>Apple Pie — Cover Design for This Number</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font11">HILE the boy thinks about apple pie —and mother, mother thinks about the boy—and the apple pie. There is no sign of pie as yet, but it is in prospect. In fact, there may be several pies, from the looks of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Speaking of pies, they must be a very ancient institution—or is a pie an institution? Anyway, Mother Goose tells about the boy who met a pie-man and made some kind of overtures to the said gentleman but without satisfactory results. Then, too, she chronicles that outstanding historical event of .the king who on his twenty-fourth birthday got a pie which was unique in several respects. (It is assumed that it was his twenty-fourth birthday or aniversary or something, because there were twenty-four blackbirds in the pie.) The unique part of this pie story is that the birds felt the heat, but didn’t start singing until the pie was opened, which was unusual, it must be admitted. There is some doubt about the authenticity of this account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The. fact that Mother Goose mentions pies is interesting; for Mother Goose wrote a very long time ago. It isn’t known how long ago </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 21, 1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ </span><span class="font11">it was, because the encyclopedia doesn’t give that information. But it does say that Mother Goose was really a French woman and that in 1628 Charles Perrault of Paris collected and published the “Cortes de Ma Mere 1’Oye”, which seems to be another and very much harder way of saying ‘Mother Goose Rhymes’. So you see, that is over three hundred years ago. Anyway, Mother Goose mentions pies, but they were probably meat pies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Fruit pies seem to be a more recent culinary product; and while they are considered to be hard to digest, nobody seems to care much. At least, the boy in the picture doesn’t seem to be troubled about such matters. Apple pies, and especially apple pies the way mother bakes them, are too good to be refused for any dietetic considerations. And perhaps, if one doesn’t eat them too often or too fast, they do not do a great deal of harm. One hopes not, anyw<sup>T</sup>ay. It would be too bad to spoil a good picture like this with such lugubrious reflections.’ Let mother enjoy preparing the pies, and let the boy enjoy the prospect of eating them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• One who styles himself Reverend Edwin J. Russell advises by leaflet that he is an Irish priest located in Devon, England. His present “House of God” is an old schoolhouse 200 years old, past repair, and has a leaking roof. He has a scheme for getting some money by a “free cash draw*. As his scheme is illegal in England he has a church address in Dublin, and from there has issued bunches of tickets for his draw. He offers money prizes to the amount of £97. The tickets are marked, “Donation only 2d each,” but in a covering leaflet he frankly asks the reader, 'whom he addresses as “My dear friend”, to purchase or sell the tickets. The dear friend is to get four free chances at the prizes, and to each seller of a bunch of 40 tickets he will send a “Blessed Rosary”. Sweepstakes are legal in the Irish Free State, but the intention seems to be to get the money out of England; for the printing is done in English, and the batch of tickets we have seen was posted to an English address. To cover the cost of the stated prize money about 12,000 tickets must be sold or paid for, to which must be added the cost of printing and postage, and rake-off amounts. The poor priest wants £4,000; so, if he depends upon his draw for the amount, he must profitably dispose of half a million “donation” tickets. Probably he expects nothing so favorable ; and the chances are that the scheme is akin to that related in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font11"> No. 492.

<h3><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>Japan’s Trade Competition</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">• Recently we noted </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">complaint, made by the Lancashire cotton goods manufacturers, of the importation of Japanese cotton goods </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font11">prices which enables shirts to be sold in Lancashire at so low a rate as one shilling (24c) each. Now the silk manufacturers in this country are complaining about the importation of Japanese silk at correspondingly low rates. It is said that over 13$ million square yards of Japanese silk are directly imported from Japan, while a further 10$ million yards arc imported via other countries, annually. Most of this silk is of an inferior quality, and is used, as figures show, very extensively for -coats, curtains, hats, umbrellas, neckties, swimming costumes, etc. The price on exportation from Japan ranges from one shilling per yard to about 2$d for the most popular qualities. Trade commission and import duties bring the price up to 6d or 8d; then the cloth is dyed and oiled in this country, but, again, it is said about 99.6 percent of the linseed oil used is imported from foreign countries. The manufacturers say that “every oiled silk coat means 3$ yards lost production to the British weaver; every oiled silk umbrella, 2 yards loss”. They call for an import duty that will give them some chance of competition, or, otherwise, they want to persuade the people to refuse to buy foreign textiles which, they say, are, after all, not so good as those of British make. The question of protection always arises with international trade. That question L' not discussed here: the point is made that the Japanese workers are surely very hardly dealt with when woven silk can be exported from Japan at prices so low as Id (2c) to 2$d (5c) per yard. Finance, like religion, holds the people in distress, and nothing but the overturning of the present dominating factors and the full establishment of the kingdom of Christ with its righteous rule can avail the people to give them their “rights”.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">“JANE, what kind of butterfly </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jk</span><span class="font11"> Mrf, is this?” asked Buddy, holding out (3 ^/X?his hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘‘That’s a clouded sulphur, Buddy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“It’s so little,” murmured Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Yes,” replied Jane, “not more than two inches across. Isn’t it a beautiful yellow color, with the touches of black 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“It’s just a cabbage butterfly,&quot; said Sally. “I’ve heard my father talk about them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Oh, but it isn’t a cabbage butterfly,” answered Jane. “Cabbage butterflies are white instead of yellow. And they are destructive. The clouded sulphur does no real damage, and brightens up so many country strolls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I’ve seen other little yellow butterflies not ' just like this one,” Sally said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Quite likely, for there are many of the sulphurs. A friend once sent me a sulphur butterfly from the West. It was a yellow or orange sulphur. Occasionally we find one of them here, though not often. The forewings are black, marked with yellow, and the shape of the markings give to this butterfly the name of ‘dog-face’. But I am sorry to say that’ this particular sulphur butterfly does considerable damage to alfalfa crops.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“But ours are nice, aren’t they?” asked Bunny, softly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Yes, dear, they are friendly and not really harmful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Jane,” interrupted Sally, “you said you had something to show me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“So I have. Buddy, bring me the insect box.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Buddy hurried off and soon returned, holding the box high and shouting, “It’s a butterfly, see?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I’ve seen them often,” said Sally. “They are black and reddish brown. What are they called?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“This is a monarch; or perhaps you have heard it called a milkweed butterfly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Yes, I’ve heard of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Soon I will have two of them, for one is asleep in that pretty green flantern’ with the sparkling golden jewels on it. That is another example of a chrysalis.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“How did it get there?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“It was built only two weeks ago by a little</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 21. 1938 </span><span class="font11">yellow and white and black caterpillar—an ugly little fellow with a pair of horns at either end.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“He was careful how he built his house,” said Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“First of all,” went on Jane, “he hanged himself upside down from that twig, making a knot of silk into which his last pair of clasping organs were entangled. Then he shed his skin, and. as he did so he was covered up in the little green case which is now his house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“But how did the green case get there?” Sally asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The caterpillar’s body gave out a sort of juice which hardened to form the chrysalis.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“What’s going to happen now?” inquired Buddy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“In a day or two the green color of the chrysalis will turn to a brown, and then shortly afterward a door will fly open in the house and out will come a milkweed butterfly, leaving the chrysalis empty and colorless.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Oh, look!” cried Bunny.. A moment later Buddy gave chase across the yard and came back holding a butterfly. “I caught a milkweed butterfly,” he announced, “and I didn’t hurt it one bit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“No, Buddy, that’s not a monarch, though it’s no small wonder you should think so. This fellow is a viceroy, and you will find across his hind wing a dark band not found on the monarch.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“They look almost alike,” declared Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“That is how the viceroy protects himself; for though he would taste good to a hungry bird, the monarch, which he looks so much like, has a very bad taste. So, our viceroy escapes many an enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“What do caterpillars eat?” asked Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Mrs. Monarch’s children, when they hatch out into tiny dark caterpillars, will eat nothing but the leaves of the milkweed plant, so it is upon the leaves of such a plant that the monarch butterfly insists upon laying her eggs. Mrs. Viceroy’s babies must have willow or poplar leaves, so her eggs will be laid where such food can be found.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“How do they know where to lay the eggs?” “That, Buddy, is part of the provision </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">of</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">By J. H emery (London)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Author of the League</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• In connection with the recent religious demonstrations connected with what is called the fourth centenary of the English Bible one of the speakers who is certainly well known in his denomination, Rev. F. C. Spurr, told his audience that “Woodrow Wilson was not the author of the League of Nations. Isaiah was tJne author of it”. From the brief press-report it appears that the preacher’s intention was to show that all modern, problems'had happened before; “You will find every social and political problem of today in the Bible,? he said. These men do not accept the Scriptures as the word of God laying up a record by the events of the days of the prophets and by His words given them by inspiration portraying thereby the events of the day of Jehovah, and giving His witnesses instruction thereby for His witness in that day. To the clergy of all sects the prophets were men of thought who gave their views to the people, some of which were written and gathered together in the book we call the Bible, and make some of the finest literature the world has. But when Mr. Spurr says Isaiah was the author of the ^League of Nations, not only does he show how a good intellect gets astray when it turns from the truth, but he gives an example of the perversion of his class. Isaiah did write of these times, and the League of Nations, and also the other leagues and pacts of these days, are foretold. But he wrote of them to condemn them, and to warn against them,- for those who made the leagues and pacts were the enemies of Israel and of Jehovah. (See Isaiah 8:12.) Isaiah had another word to say to the clergy class of his day. He charged them with falsity: “This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me.” They put their own wisdom in place of the word of God, and Isaiah said, “Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay.” (Isaiah 29:13-16) This same preacher has publicly declared that he has</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">had communication with one of the dead members of his family, and in doing so he denied the Scriptures, which state that the dead are dead, and have no knowledge (Ecclesiastes 9:10), and transgressed the divine law.—Deuteronomy 18:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“Patriotism” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>z</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• Tb^ Select Committee on Estimates has issutd a report on the prices charged to the Government by firms supplying fire-fighting equipment in connection with the Air Raid Protection. It accuses certain firms of profit-' eering. The report says, “The suppliers of hose,” an essential part of A.R.P. equipment, appear io have reached an arrangement of the nature of a ring or cartel; and those firms ' quote uniform prices and pool the orders received.” It is stated that some firms, constituting one industry of importance, have refused facilities for checking their prices. The Office of Works “were able to negotiate a reduction on the prices quoted in the first instance, and are how stipulating for an examination of the contractor’s books in order to ascertain actual costs before further orders are placed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The newspapers report the arrival in Southampton harbor of a very costly yacht, built <sup>1 </sup>in Holland for one of Britain’s motor magnates. It is pointed out that the yacht might well have been built in one of the British shipbuilding yards where work is badly needed. The cost would have been greater, but perhaps not. heavily so. The item of news is more . noticeable than it. would ordinarily have been because this same gentleman was one of the motor manufacturers who recently loudly complained of the loss of home work and money, and incidentally to themselves by reason, of the importation<sup>1</sup> of German cars, sold at . a price with which they cannot compete. Patriotism mostly consists of lojjd speaking urging the other man to make sacrifices for the good of his country. The armament makers show extra-good dividends, and on the plea that business must be treated as sueh all are on the make while the chance offers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">cover what is Britain’s real attitude towards his well-known designs on Czechoslovakia. Some of his advisers think Britain is bluffing in the matter of its help to that country in case of Germany’s attacking it. The diplo-• matic correspondent of the Manchester </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Guard</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ian</span><span class="font11"> says that if Hitler comes to the conclusion that Britain is bluffing and will not actually interfere with his aggressive action on Czechoslovakia he will at once send an armed force • </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font11"> occupy that country. If, however, he comes to the conclusion that Britain really means what its premier recently said, namely, that Britain would never allow any aggressive action against the.Czechs without Britain’s taking part with France in the defense of that people, he will not undertake warlike action. However, there is little question that sooner or later Czechoslovakia will become part of greater Germany.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>Air Raid Precaution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">• Despite the much advertising of the necessity or importance of each person’s being supplied with a gas mask, and the many urgent calls for volunteers for the needed help-■ers should occasion arise, there is a general apathy: less than half of the number of volunteers are registered, and the people do not register the fear of a gas attack as they were expected to do. There are many in position to judge who say that the whole business is futile. A Labor leader says, “No responsible person today puts faith in a gas mask. For . ordinary civilians like you and me the ‘respirator’ to be supplied costs wholesale two shillings and two pence. Those supplied to air wardens and officials cost 10/9 each ; those supplied for people engaged on active service cost £2.7.10(1. It is admitted that cigarette smoke will pass through the ordinary type of mask. Various scents can be perfectly well smelt when the mask is on and is fitted perfectly. You will choke dead if you go into a room filled with ordinary coal gas, even if you have on a brand-new mask . . . they do not protect against carbon oxide, exhaust gases from motor cars, sewer gas, petrol vapor or similar vapors. In any event they will not render the wearer safe in situations where the danger arises from a deficiency of oxygen.” In a conference of architects called in connection with A.R.P. and at which the Home Secretary, the responsible minister, was present, one speaker bluntly told the conference that these measures were “perfectly use'ess”, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBERS'!, 1938 </span><span class="font11">and said, “Let us be honest md sincere and say that we will have nothing to do with all this nonsense . . . the precautions would be of no more use in an air raid than an umbrella.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark172"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>War Preparations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">• Besides the great quantities of wheat and other foodstuff, and of oils from which edible fats can be taken, the Government has made provision for medical and surgical aid in case of war. Already there are more thair 40,000 doctors and surgeons in Britain listed, and ready to respond for service on call. This does not mean that there is fear of an immediate outbreak of war, but it does mean that there are very active preparations made, in case that terrible calamity should happen. There are great store places for the needs of the army: not only for food, but for equipment. A newspaperman reports that he had been allowed to visit one of the great store places, tunneled into hills, and camouflaged. He says it is entirely bomb proof, and has accommodation also for 1,500 employees to live in if necessary. Everything necessary for the maintenance of motor transport on a large scale is there, with separate garages for tanks, lorries, trucks, heavy gun tractors, wireless carriers and pontoon-carrying lorries. Two hundred drivers are employed in the task of collection and delivery alone. At present this depot is staffed entirely by men, but the War Office plans to have a female staff fully trained in the event of war. These picked girls are now being trained in batches of 100, and, by the end of the year, will constitute an auxiliary force capable of going into action.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>Sales of Quack Medicines</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">• Lord Horder, physician to the king, called attention in the House of Lords to the enormous growth in the quack medicine trade, and the incongruity of exercising no control over the deleterious effects of such trade upon the health of the people at a time when serious effort is being made to improve national fitness. Disclaiming any thought of self-interest oi for his profession he said that the quaek medicine trade bled the publie to the tune of £30,000,000 a year. Speaking of the advantages gained by the public health services he said, “For every £100 the Government spends in making the people health conscious tho (Continued on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">page t6)</span></p>

During the month of October Jehovah’s witnesses and their associates will put forth a tremendous effort, leaving this booklet in as jnany homes as can possibly be called upon in 31 days.
