<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Infantile Paralysis Fund</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Glenside, Pa., May 11, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. Edward R. Fuller</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and Mr. Wm. F. Leach, Co-Chairmen, Phila. Infantile Paralysis Fund, e/o Corn Exchange National Bank, Second and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gentlemen :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I recently received a letter from yon at my Philadelphia address,- requesting a contribution, and bearing in the letterhead the words “Help Reep Infantile Paralysis Away from Your Door.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the body of your letter, after stating how terrible the disease is, you go on to say “The problem of prevention and the problem of treatment are not yet solved” and that “any money spent on either of these problems will be money well spent”, and at the bottom of your letter appear the names of some well-known Philadelphians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And in another part of your letter you quote Dr. Willard of the University of Pennsylvania, Graduate School of Medicine, saying “To be struck down by this disease is the greatest disaster that can happen to a child, because of permanent crippling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I do not know who you are—whether you are members of the medical profession—or just well-meaning.citizens—but of one thing I am certain, and that is, your failure to mention the fact that the white pus organism found in those afflicted with infantile paralysis is also found in the virus used to vaccinate children and others against smallpox; that after a batch of this virus was shipped here and there throughout the country from a distributing point, infantile paralysis broke out wherever it was shipped; that said virus is nothing more nor less than the putrid dis-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JIM.Y 13, 1838 </span><span class="font3">charge from the sores of diseased animals; and that when it is introduced into the pure blood stream of a healthy person it contaminates it, causing illness, disease and death— disease sometimes far worse than the one claimed to be guarded against. And doctors wonder where cancer, heart trouble and numerous other ailments of unknown origin come from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the medical profession profitably inflicting on their fellow men innumerable diseases and tragedies through compulsory vaccination, and adding, to these indescribable misery and torture in cutting up living animals in useless experimentation, I must respectfully decline, to contribute to your funds. Instead I shall give all I can to the cause of that courageous man, John Marsh, imprisoned indefinitely at Carlisle, Pa., for refusing to consent to poison virus’ being put into his boy. I ata amazed that the president and other well-meaning citizens permit their names to be used in this self-enriching undertaking of the medical dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The best medical scientists of the world condemn vaccination in black and white as a dangerous practice. They cannot be fooled by the manufacturers of virus and vaccine who make millions each year on stuff destined to blight and destroy lives—stuff which their paid propaganda advertises as beneficial and protective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This stuff—the putrid discharge from the running sores of diseased persons and animals—something that you certainly would not put into your mouth or in the mouths of children—is put directly into the pure blood stream, causing worse contamination there than if taken into the mouth. And then it steals the credit for improved conditions brought about by contemporaneous improvements in sanitation, water supply, food supply and improved heating, housing, ventilation and living conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is a terrible wrong to humanity by virus makers who are either ignorant or unscrupulous, to say nothing of the tremendous number of animals rendered unfit for milk or food and afflicted with hoof and mouth and ' other diseases to produce this poison until they die in misery and agony or are uselessly slaughtered, and to say nothing of the countless numbers of smaller animals cut up alive and poisoned in the making of experiments and left to die in misery and suffering to see effects on them, and to say nothing of the human virus or poison coming from' persons afflicted with disease in thickly populated colored sections of the South and Eastern Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And yet no medical man can guarantee that your child is a “fit” subject of vaccination. Nor can he guarantee that the stuff will not cause present harm in the form of lockjaw or infantile paralysis or future harm in the form of cancer, syphilis, insanity, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Time was when smallpox was caused by unsanitary and other conditions. Then, between 1700 and 1800, the medical profession inoculated against smallpox, causing everyone to carry the disease, and bringing on epidemics so that finally inoculation was forbidden by law A-just another mistake of the medical profession—which caused untold misery and countless deaths. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another so-called remedy of the medical profession was bloodletting. Georgy Washington was a victim of this bit of medipal experimentation. Taken ill at the age of 67, but still strong and hardy, they let so much of his blood out in combating the illness that he succumbed—not to the illness—but just bled to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now we have vaccination. It is claimed that vaccination stopped terrible smallpox epidemics. This is not true. This is propaganda manufactured by virus and serum makers to boost their sales and profits. The epidemics were caused by poor sewerage of the 1700 to 1800 period, contaminated water supply, bad food, shallow .graves in city limits, etc. When these, intensified by inoculation, disappeared, the epidemics disappeared to some extent, and would have disappeared .completely but for the new medical fad started by Jenner about the year 1800. This, continued the ailment. Where vaccjatrt&amp;ffe is no. longer compulsory it is dying but as a practice and smallpox' is ' ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">disappearing. On the other hand, statistics show that epidemics, disease and death have followed wholesale vaccination and revaccination and that unvaccinated communities are comparatively free from disease. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I also have in my possession a list of children all over Pennsylvania and elsewhere who died immediately after or shortly following vaccination, from diseases it brought on. The law of Pennsylvania and of the few other states that require this terrible thing must be changed. An entirely new lower house of the state legislature, half of the state senate and a new governor will be elected this year. Those candidates who will not pledge themselves to vote-against the compulsory feature of the law will be opposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why did England abolish compulsory vaccination in 1907, with a drop in smallpox and the death rate therefrom to a small fraction of what it used to be? Why did Denmark abolish compulsory vaccination last year after having it since the year 1810! Why do 39 of our 48 states not require compulsory vaccination, and 5 states actually forbid it! And why is Pennsylvania one of nine states having compulsory vaccination in one. form or another— compelling all public school children to have their blood poisoned with the putrid discharge from the running sores of diseased animals? No wonder we have so many backward children, so many children’s diseases, so many diseases with causes unknown to the doctors,<sup>1 </sup>and overflowing. insane, asylums, hospitals, and institutions for the blind, etc., and innumerable premature deaths. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. The answer is that Pennsylvania- and the other eight states have allowed the medical profession, financed by the millionaire virus and serum makers, to come in and run their state governments, to dictate to their people, to enter their homes,.to tyrannically impose upon them compulsory medication, and to require injections and ■ operations costing countless numbers of lives and causing untoki misery and suffering for millions.. They have forgotten completely that the school is public, and%not the child; but.no doctor has a right to operate on or treat or vaccinate any child without the parent’s consent; that the Constitutions of. the United States and of Pennsylvania are written instruments, and that what they meant when they were drawn they still mean, and -that the Common Law rights, privileges and immunities of citizens guaran</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">teed by these constitutions are still theirs, and any law talcing away these rights and immunities is null and void and not to be obeyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the duty of oUr courts to protect us in our Constitutional rights. And the time is ripe and has now arrived for all citizens—all true lovers of American liberty—to rise in rebellion against this medical tyranny and dictatorship in nine states; in the District of Columbia and in our Federal Government, driving it out of public office, and taking its selfhelping hands out of the public treasury, placing all methods of treating human ills on an equal footing in the eyes of the law, without discrimination against one or the other, and with each subject to a governing board of its own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let Pennsylvania lead the way in . this glorious fight for human liberty and for medical freedom. Let Pennsylvania show the way for the other eight states to follow. This nation cannot exist part slave and part free. Let us all have the privilege of choosing* the type and kind of treatment each one desires just as freely as each one has the freedom to choose his food, his clothes and his religion. Until this is done complete freedom will not be known in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have assumed the leadership in this fight. I realize that I am not fighting the medical profession so much as a mistake of that profession in allowing itself to be run by virus and serum racketeers from outside—racketeers who have gotten the profession to interfere with our governments, our laws, and our private lives. There are many noble men and women in the profession and some of them are very good friends of mine. To these I appeal to purge their profession of undesirables —to these I appeal to take medicine out of politics—to these I appeal to join with their fellow citizens in recovering for them the medical freedom to which they are entitled— that Common Law right of personal security guaranteed by our Constitution and which secures each individual in the enjoyment of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font3"> life, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font3"> limbs, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font3"> body, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font3"> health and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his -</span><span class="font3">reputation. (Blackstone’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font3"> leader in this great cause I pledge that there shall be no interference with the legitimate functioning of the medical profession fair*the benefit of those who desire its services, the Golden Rule shall prevail. And to this endT invite communication from medical men in sympathy with what I have outlined above, JVLY13,*WW</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">as there willbe ample opportunity for them to co-operate in this undertaking and to aid in bringing about a new and better order of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Please pardon the length of this letter, but I just could not resist the opportunity to tell you why I will not contribute one cent to the Philadelphia Infantile Paralysis Fund. I feel that the good citizens whose names have been used have been misled, just as the rank and file of the medical profession has been misled. I sympathize with the sufferers from this terrible medical blunder. But so long as the medical profession brings such things on through putting poison in the human system, and so long as the funds are needlessly used ''to cut up living dogs, and other pets and monkeys, with untold suffering and torture, I cannot see my way clear to contribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sincerely yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">H. Eugene Gardner. [Prominent attorney of Philadelphia, Pa.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.] '</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Postscript—</span><span class="font3">Three times during the term of an ex-governor of Pennsylvania the legislature voted by a large majority to curb compulsory vaccination, and three times he vetoed the bill directly or by pocket veto. Thereafter, whenever a child died or suffered from vaccination the governor received notice of it— of the child’s death and funeral—until he finally said &quot;For God’s sake stop sending me those notices”, and expressed his regret that he had vetoed the bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A subject of vaccination found that it did not take until four years after the operation. The mark appeared on the arm four years after the operation. This is one of many instances showing, that the virus, sometimes not quite so strong when put, into a person, may increase in strength, and become active after lodging inactive in a recess of the arm or other part of the body for years, possibly causing untold mischief' without the cause thereof being detected. Something like the corn found in the tombs in Egypt, which lay there for thousands of years and when taken out and planted grew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The virus causes an attack or riot at the point introduced into the system, drawing the natural forces dfithe person to that point and reducing strengf&amp;elsewhere all along the line. The disease becomes masked and inverted. The white corpuscles are increased in number to meet the attack, but reduced in potency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That is why a doctor who vaccinated himself fifteen times, and boasted he was still healthy, burned his lip with a cigarette and found insufficient in his system to resist the burn, which became cancer of the face, ate his face away, and caused his death about six months after he made his boast.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Blindness from Vaccination</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">SOME years ago a newspaperman in New York state, by the name of James A. Loyster, lost his only son within a month after vaccination against smallpox. Previously the boy had been in good health. Right after vaccination, he got infantile paralysis, became paralyzed, and died within a month. Loyster, who had believed in vaccination, was not only a newspaperman, but also a Republican leader in the New York Legislature and head of the Globe Ticket Company in Philadelphia. He •sent letters to newspapers all over New York state asking for information concerning fatal and serious cases of illness following vaccination. A printed postal card for reply was enclosed with each letter. Almost half of the newspapers approached returned cards. From among these were obtained the names of 27 children who died subsequent to vaccination, and almost 100 who had been seriously ill. Thus it was found that more persons were injured by vaccination than by the ailment which vaccination is supposed to protect against. It was found in an area of 20 miles square where there had never been a case of smallpox in the memory of any living inhabitant that four children died following vaccination from illness caused by it within the one year—1914. The figures elsewhere in New York were also quite astounding, and as a result of the survey the compulsory feature was abolished by the New York Legislature almost all over the state of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have been imprisoned in Cumberland County jail at Carlisle almost continuously since November 15, 1937, for refusal to consent to the vaccination of my son, Eugene, age 8, to qualify him by vaccination for admission to school. I have been referred to as “stubborn” and “bullheaded” for not giving consent, but I am not stubborn and bullheaded. I have seen my brother’s two girls go blind following vaccination and I have seen one of them die from it. Their eyes swelled up in their heads and burst, leaving only empty</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">eye pits. And then my own boy was vaccinated four years ago without my consent while they kept me in jail for eight months for refusing to consent, and since then the boy has not been well, whereas before he was in good health. I have also received letters from others injured by vaccination and from still others who have lost dear ones following it and I have learned enough about vaccination to make me afraid of what might happen to my boy if he is vaccinated, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I understand that vaccination does not hurt everyone vaccinated immediately after Vaccination; that immediate injury' is caused only to persons susceptible to certain diseases, such as infantile paralysis, tetanus and syphilis; that diseases such as cancer, consumption and tumors are induced in later life by quicker growth of animal cells than the human, causing bunching and growths here and there in the system which otherwise would not have occurred; and that no doctor can tell in advance whether or not one vaccinated is susceptible to illness which may be induced by it. As a matter of fact, I have been informed of three children in one family being vaccinated by the same doctor at the same time, using the same vaccine on. each of them, and of whom one got tetanus and died within a week, one got infantile paralysis and went blind within a month, and the third was not affected at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If vaccination immunizes and protects those who are vaccinated, then they have nothing to fear from those who are not vaccinated. Each one should be left free to choose for himself, and no one should be forced by law to undergo a practice or operation that may induce a disease in his system which may cause loss of life or of health or which may result in permanent invalidism.—John Marsh, Cumberland County Prison, Carlisle, Pa., in the Middle Ages [1938].</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Johnstown Police Data Destroyed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Imagine how the mayor of Johnstown must have felt, if he was a real man, when, asked by Senator La Follette to produce the names of 500 special police sworn in by himself at the time of Hie steel strike, and the amounts that had been paid to them, he was forced to admit that he had destroyed all the records. It is easy enough to imagine why the records were destroyed and the motive that was back of it all.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19380713_files/g_E_19380713-3.png" alt="" style="width:45pt;height:52pt;">

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">John Milton, Senator for Frank Hague </span><span class="font3">Meet. John Milton, theoretically United States senator for New Jersey; in fact and in truth the United States senator for Frank Hague, whose attorney he has been and is. Milton was in the Senate only 48 hours when he was accorded the honor of presiding over the Senate’s deliberations as a substitute for Vice-President Garner. In his capacity as attorney for Mi'. Hague, in the seven years from 1921 to 1928 he paid out in cheeks $380,910,50, which amount Mr. Hague refunded to him in cash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nobody would dare come right out and say that Mr. Hague compels every office holder in New Jersey to eotnc across with 2 percent of his salary, or else be left out in the cold, but many have wondered how the dictator of the Garden State managed to save the neat little sum of nearly half a million dollars in seven years, on a salary never over $8,000 a year. A job where a man can save $56,130.07 a year for seven years running on a salary of less than onc-sevehth of that amount, is surely some job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, Hague has never yet descended to the putrescent depths of Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Even New Jersey, and even Frank Hague, at his lowest and meanest, have hardly come down to the level of the butchers of Ethiopia and of Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently, Mr. Hague, Mr. Milton's boss, had 26 C.I.O. workers forced into automobiles, driven to the city limits, and warned to stay out. Seven who returned were given five days in jail; six others who returned were held for possible indictment for unlawful assembly. The excuse for the arrests was the ordinance of distributing circulars without police permission. This the courts have declared is an unconstitutional ordinance. In their illegal work the police not only resorted to kidnaping, which is a particularly indictable offense, but even pried open lunch boxes looking for circulars, though they found nothing more deadly than pickles and sandwiches.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>“I Am the Law” Hague</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Mayor Hague advances the premise that a defense of persons arrested or incarcerated </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 13,1*38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in violation of the Bill of Rights is a 'Communistic’ activity. In support of this statement, he lists my numerous appearances in court in defense of religious organizations and individuals, many of whom were deprived of their constitutional rights by Hague’s police whose often-expressed creed is that the mayor’s orders are sufficient warrant to deport and jail individuals whose crime is the exercise of freedom of worship and other civil rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mayor Hague, sworn to uphold the Constitution, has the official obligation to protect all persons from invasion of their rights without distinction as to their creed, race, color, political or trade union affiliation. In this he has failed. Of this he boasts, He said recently, “I am the law.” No wonder, then, that those who think that the Constitution is higher authority than the mayor of Jersey City are ‘'Reds.”, To Jersey City’s “dictator” all believers in democratic rights are Communists. Under that definition I cannot escape his charges. I still believe in civil liberty and democracy.—Abraham J. Isserman. [Prominent Newark (N.

<p><span class="font3">♦ To a politician every person that is not a ring-kisscr or toe-kisser is a “Communist”; and therefore it is of interest that Norman Thomas, college graduate, Presbyterian minister and many times candidate for president on the Socialist ticket, was chased out of Fascist (Catholic Action) Jersey City, along with his wife, because Dictator Hague’s legions thought if he remained he would corrupt their morals, if any, and they might also learn something—a thing not to be tolerated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">♦ There are too many does in New Jersey, and farmers and berry growers have petitioned the State Fish and Game Commission to do something about it. The does lightly leap over a fence fourteen feet high; so they want to know why they cannot kill a few, so they can raise something without having it oaten by the beautiful and graceful creatures that so much appreciate their labors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">♦ The burglars that supply New York city with milk are experts in their line. They give the farmers that produce the milk barely enough to exist; but do they know how to feather burglars’ nests? On July!, 1937, they boosted the price to consumers to 14c a quart, a net rake-off of $90,000 a day, or more than $32,000,000 a year, over and above their previous takings. In case of another World Foolishness, as in 1914-1918, they would expect every American to do his duty, even if some of his babies do starve to death in the meantime. City and state laws are fixed to protect the milk burglars.</span></p>

He thus admitted that in all the years in which he has been professing to be a servant of the Most High God he has been part of the class mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2:3.</span></p>

Friends in the tailor business called him a sucker; but the matter got into the papers, and Herman received kind letters from all over. Many of the letters contained dollar bills; but even if they did not, any one of them was worth more than any mere cash reward. Herman, reading the letters, asked WVho is the sucker now?” He had it right,</span></p>

Thus cotton farmers, steel workers, coal miners, doctors, industrialists in each branch of industry, and all other classes, would incorporate and choose their own representatives. People are easier to Control “a la chessboard”.

<p><span class="font3">You know that it is un-American for school board or legislature to attempt to question a child’s loyalty, or even an adult’s loyalty, to his government^ or to set up a test of his loyalty.

I never took an oath to stand, sit, wear a hat, or strip in the presence of flag, governor, or even president. Why? Because there is no authority on earth that has the right to administer that oath, regardless of what half-baked legislation may set forth. A servant cannot require an oath of his master. The citizen is the master, and, until he offers to become the people’s servant by accepting some office, he may walk as seexnetb best to him and manifest his love for his flag and his country by silent composure, or by boisterously shouting his loyalty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">‘AU day I watched a butterfly That flitted through my garden, Sipping from the sweetest flowers And never asking pardon ' ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">*1 like that, Jane. And I like butterflies. I often think, ‘Beauty is its own excuse for being*; so that is reason enough for butterflies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I suppose all of us have watched the airy, graceful flight and noticed the gay beauty of our butterfly friends. Who would care to think of sweet flowers, summer fields, and sunlit afternoons without our lovely butterflies to dip and dance and flutter through it all!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Yes, they are beautiful. But they have another use, Sally. They are true and valuable helpers. Watch this great yellow and black fellow drifting lazily across the garden. Doesn’t he remind you of a living sunbeam?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“He’s a gorgeous thing, Jane!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“There! he has settled on the weigela just beside us, nodding a little, dipping up and down. From between his eyes he has unpurled a funny little spring and is thrusting it deep into the pink throat of the flower. If we could see that spring greatly enlarged, we would find that it is a hollow tube. Through this tube, or proboscis, the butterfly drinks the sweet nectar of the flower. When he has finished his feast, the tube rolls-’up again and is almost completely hidden from sight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Do Luna and Cecropia and the other moths get nectar from the same kind of flowers'!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Those moths never eat anything. They ha’W no digestive systems, but live on food already stored in their bodies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I think that’s wonderful, Janel Ah, the butterfly is flying away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Yes, but not far. The brilliant four-o’cloeks have attracted him. As he tries to reach the delicious nectar, his barbed feet brush across the stamens of the flower ; and upon flying away he carries with him on those little barbs sojpe yellow pollen which is the life of the flower. This process is repeated with each visit, but each time he not only gathers new pollen on his feet, but scrapes off into the blossom sopm of the golden dust belonging to another flower.

<p><span class="font3">“Of course, our little winged friend is not at all concerned about that. He doesn't even know what a help he is to us. All he cares about is the sweet liquid which he must have to keep alive. It is the provision of the Creator that he should be helpful as well as beautiful.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“Tiger Swallowtail. A strange but very fitting name. Did you notice the two long tail-like pieces on his hindwings? They remind one very much of the two parts into which the tail of our swallow bind is divided; therefore the name.”</span></p>

One, called the Pipe-vine Swallowtail, has a blue or green luster on the hindwings—a shimmery sheen like hidden lights on metallic paint. There are a few light, crescent-shaped spots near the ‘tails'. The forewings are soft and dark and velvety. There is no other color except a slight edging of yellow on both sets of wings.

<p><span class="font3">PUBLIC-MINDED school teachers at Atlantic City were well heated mentally at the proposal of the President’s Advisory Comniitte to extend federal aid to parochial schools. This division of tax receipts along religious lines was tried out in both Australia and Ontario, and abandoned because of the immediate and endless strife and disorder resulting therefrom. In Ontario the religious gangsters, after obtaining control of their pro-rata share of the tax receipts, insisted also on prorata share of dividends of industrial companies along the same lines and for the same objectives. With that the Ontario government figuratively threw up its hands and said the law must be abandoned or the entire province would be involved in anarchy.- If the President’s Advisory Committee learned nothing from the experiments ' in Australia and Ontario, how would it do for them to spend a few minutes thinking about the effort the founders of America made to keep church and state separate and apart in this land? Or maybe they do not like to think of such things. And, further, if one set of gangsters or racketeers can get a percentage of the taxes for the inaintenanee of schools which will teach their particular form of racketeering, all can see that there is nothing whatever to restrain the 210 other sects from doing the same thing, and the public schools must perish and a Mexico or Spain be the outcome. Indeed,-that is what the religious gangsters most desire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">♦ What is the government doing about it? According to the big business authorities, there is only one thing for the government to do, and the president, now thoroughly chastened and tamed, is doing it. He is going to stop frightening business men and hurting their feelings. He is going to reduce their taxes and make it possible for them to put people back to work. All the government credit agencies, such as the RFC, are going to lend money to business men, big and little, that the business men can start producing goods and hiring labor. Once more the old Hoover gag; the one method that Hoover had for ending the depression, and which he started applying at the beginning of 1930 and continued to apply until the beginning of 1933— during all of which period business con-d i ti ons took one plunge after another into the abyss.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Flight of Wild Geese</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This mighty bird army, which winters along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, becomes restive in the early half of March, lured by the age-old enticements of the higher latitudes of the North. At a favorable time in the latter part of the month the flocks take to the air and commence the long flight to Canada along the Mississippi flyway. Noisy advances and enforced halts mark the northward flight, as the weather may be fickle and backward with belated, snowstorms, but finally, with the appearance of real spring, and very often on a strong south wind, the army of migrants sweeps into Manitoba by the bun* dreds of thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The average date of arrival is about the end of the first week of April, and a few days of ideal weather conditions are sufficient to bring the birds to the Manitoba feeding grounds in maximum numbers. This total is unknown and probably always will be, but is commonly referred to as running into the millions. Some of the greatest concentrations of geese occur within a few miles of Winnipeg, and prodigious numbers are to be seen in the' lowlands about Grant’s Lake and near Rosser, Marquette, Grosse Isle and Woodlands, Frequently tens of thousands of mixed snow and blue geese come together in a single locality, and at such times acres of ground are covered white as with drifted snow. The springtime halt in Manitoba lasts for about one month, during which period the geese feed and recuperate after the long flight from the Gulf of Mexico. Then, depending on seasonal conditions, the flocks depart in late April or early May for the nesting grounds in the Arctic regions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Globe-trotting Birds</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The powers of endurance displayed by large numbers of North American birds on their lengthy migratory journeys is amazing, but there is one species that outrivals them all. This is the Arctic tern, aptly referred to as “the champion globe-trotter and long-distance flier of the bird world’’. The species is well named, as its range is circumpolar and it nests over the Arctic land as far north as suitable conditions can be found. When the young are well-grown the Canadian and Greenland terns disappear from their breeding grounds and a few months later may be found even as far away as Africa. In fact, the longest flight on record for an individual bird was achieved by an Arctic tern that in three months flew from the coast of Labrador to the Niger river in western Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The journey of the terns is believed to follow a route touching upon the west coasts of Spain and Africa, and on the return trip northward individuals are known to fly along the east coast of South America. The route indicated for this bird is altogether unique, as no other species is known to breed abundantly in North America and to traverse the Atlantic ocean to or from the Old World. These globe-trotting birds travel many thousands of miles and touch on four continents in the course of a year.</span></p>

If this telescope could be trained on New York city, the observer looking at a building at that distance would be able to tell whether it was a one-story or a two-story structure. By the same calculation the moon will be eighty miles away. The new telescope, with this lens 16 feet 8 inches across, is costing $6,000,000. It will be carried to its destination on a road 20 miles long which is being specially constructed for the purpose. It will disclose what lies at a distance of 1,200,000,000 light-years. The telescope itself will be 70 feet long, and will require 800 tons of rotating machinery to operate it.

His library may be a few small films, the size of a watch, read with the aid of a projecting machine smaller than a typewriter.

Then a treedozer was used, clearing eighteen acres a day with one man, and now the improved machine clears, grubs, and plows from eight to ten acres a day under the operation of one skilled worker.

Slicers Frank Reed and John Merger learned the art from a naturalized Dane, who in turn learned it in Norway. The first step is to take a bit of rock and grind it smooth on a wheel. Then the smooth face is cemented to a glass slide. Next the other side is ground to the required thickness of a thousandth of an inch. Under the microscope the slice is a fairyland of brilliant hues and intricate patterns. Some 4,000 rock specimens are thus prepared every year.

<h3><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>The Northwest Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">M</span><span class="font3">ANY of our readers have requested that we publish more complete reports of conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses. That such conventions are important is readily conceded. It is further conceded that news-channels do not give adequate publicity to them, being apparently agreed that this must not be done. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> has heretofore given considerable space to news about such conventions, but it has not seemed advisable to omit too many of the regular features of the magazine and to give to convention news what might to some readers appear to be a disproportionate amount of space. The difficulty is solved in th e case of the Northwest Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses by the publication of a special report, and which will appear as a supplement to this issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19380713_files/g_E_19380713-9.png" alt="" style="width:193pt;height:162pt;">
<p><span class="font2">Conventioners</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">The Northwest convention was outstanding in many respects; It was the largest convention of Jehovah’s witnesses ever held in that part of the United States. Conventioners came from all the states, though the Northwest was most heavily represented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses come to conventions, not as “delegates”, but as personal representatives of Jehovah’s organization, each meeting his own expenses and contributing his share of co-operative effort to the success of the convention. No distance is too great for them to travel, even though in many eases the journey must be made with a house-car or trailer. The business of the witnesses is to publish the truth concerning the King and the kingdom of Jehovah, and a convention serves to accomplish that object. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to affording an opportunity of widely advertising or publishing the gospel of the Kingdom, in obedience to Matthew 24:14 and other Scriptural instructions, a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses is an occasion of together considering timely Bible truths that enable the witnesses to keep abreast of events by the light that divine prophecy sheds upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A widely advertised lecture by Judge Rutherford, one of Jehovah’s witnesses and president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, is always a feature of a general convention. In the case of the lecture “Violence”, the climax of the Northwest convention, over 1,000,000 announcements were personally delivered by the witnesses to the people of Seattle and of the territory fifty mile? in every direction from that center. Additionally, a special Western chain of radio stations, carrying the message to the inhabitants of the West, was given wide publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further means of advertising the lecture consisted of signs on cars. In passing mention may be made of the fact that members of the Knights of Columbus took license. numbers of cars bearing signs, ostensibly to send them Catholic literature, but more as a covert threat of that violence exposed in the lecture. Jehovah’s witnesses could not forbear a smile at this gesture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■Newspapers are sometimes employed, but only sometimes. Frequently the editors and owners are so white-livered that they are afraid to give publicity to such a truth-telling group as Jehovah’s witnesses have proved to be. Truth is dangerous to those whose chief claim to fame is their personal conviction that they’ve got to live. That notion is open to argument. At any rate, the truth is considered of little importance to “newspapers” moved by that sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The supplement will give </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> readers all the vital information that the newspapers failed to publish. The truth will be made known, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> is glad to give special attention to giving the public the facts which they have a right to know, <sup>T</sup></span></p><img src="g_E_19380713_files/g_E_19380713-10.png" alt="" style="width:196pt;height:73pt;">
<p><span class="font8">Q</span><span class="font3">UESTION: The Pharisees, who were the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jewish clergymen, propounded io Jesus this question: “Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar?” What is meant by “Caesar”? and why did they ask that question? By what means is one to determine the dividing line between the two?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: The Pharisees were the religious leaders that claimed to represent God, but they were unfaithful to their covenant with God and were looking out for their selfish interests. They tried to lay a trap for Jesus and to have Him say something against the Roman authority that they could catch onto and charge Jesus with treason and have Him put to death. Therefore with subtlety they propounded the question; but the Lord Jesus answered them so completely that they were unable to say anything against Him at that time. Caesar was the Roman governor, and his representative was in charge at Jerusalem; and therefore Caesar stood for the “state”, just as Hitler is now the dictator of Germany, called “the leader”, and stands for the “state”. The question of the Pharisaical clergy was substantially this: Is it lawful for one to obey the law made by the “state”, or the law made by God? The answer of Jesus was, “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.” (Luke 20:25) Caesar, or the “state”, exercised the power to make laws, and all such laws, said Jesus, should be obeye.d, unless by obeying those laws one would disobey God, who is supreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The means of determining the dividing line is the word of God set forth in our Bible. Jehovah God is supreme, and His law is above the law of any creature or nation, and any law made by men or nations and enforced or attempted to be enforced, and which law is contrary to God’s law, is wrong. Man’s first and primary duty is to obey God his Creator. It is the duty of the “state” or nation to arrange its laws in harmony with the divine </span><span class="font2">JULY 13, 1938 </span><span class="font3">law. It is within the right of the “state” to levy and collect tribute or taxes for the purpose of meeting the legitimate expenses of the government. It is not the right or duty of the “state” or government to compel citizens to worship, bow down to, or attribute salvation to any creature or any thing. God’s law says.: “Thou shalt have no 'other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, . . . Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.” (Exodus 20:3-5) In the dictatorial government under Hitler, the dictator acts arbitrarily and attempts to compel all the people of that land to “heil -Hitler” and constantly utter that phrase, which means that they are thereby attributing to Hitler protection and salvation. .Some other states or governments, which, of course, are represented by “Caesar”, demand that, all persons, and particularly school children, shall be required to salute a flag, thereby attributing salvation to that which the flag represents, which is the “state”. God’s law concerning man is this; “Salvation belongeth unto the Lord.” (Psalm 3:8) All true Christians, that is to say, those who have made a covenant to do the will of God, even as Christ Jesus covenanted with His Father, are bound by that covenant to obey God, and any failure or refusal on the part of the person to obey God means the destruction of that person. Not all persons come strictly under such rule, but those who have made a covenant to do God’s will must obey that rule. It most emphatically applies to those who are Jehovah’s witnesses, because they have undertaken to do God’s will. The answer of Jesus to the question, therefore, was in substance this: The “state”, or Caesar, may properly levy or collect taxes. Therefore obey that law and laws similar thereto and all such laws that are not in conflict with God’s law. Salvation proceeds from Jehovah God alone. Therefore render unto Jehovah that which He requires. Obey His law always.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God caused His law to be construed, which plainly illustrates the point here made, and that construction is a guide for everyone who agrees to be obedient to Jehovah’s will. That construction or illustration is found in Daniel the third chapter. The “state”, represented by the king, Nebuchadnezzar, set up an image and made a law requiring all persons to bow down before that image at a given signal. The king there stood for “Caesar”, and hence there was no exception made, but everyone must bow down to the image. In that land there were certain Hebrew men who were in a covenant to obey Jehovah God, and those men re- • fused to bow down before Nebuchadnezzar’s image and they assigned a reason for so doing: That they could not violate God’s law. They said to the king: “Be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. . . . Our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us.” (Daniel 3:18,17) Thus they showed absolute faith in the power and protection and salvation provided by the Lord God. Because they took this position, the king (that is, “Caesar”) caused those three men to be cast into a red-hot furnace. God miraculously delivered them from the fiery furnace and brought them forth without even a scorch on their clothing; and thus God approved their action, and thereby He construed His own law to mean that man must obey God first, and that when there is any conflict between God’s law and the law of man, God’s covenant people must obey the law of the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today the “state” says: “You must salute the flag. Otherwise you will be punished.” The true followers of Christ Jesus answer: “We cannot do that, because for us to salute any flag, thereby attributing salvation to what a flag represents, would be a flagrant violation of God’s law, and, we being in a covenant to obey Him, we must obey.” There is no difficulty in finding the dividing line between “Caesar” (the “state”) and Jehovah God, because the Bible makes it plain. Everyone who does right will obey every law that is right; and any law that is not in harmony with God’s law is not right. The true followers of Christ Jesus do not salute flags or bow down to images, because they know that salvation proceeds from God, and Him they will obey. The apostles of Jesus Christ followed the same construction. When they were brought before the court, charged with preaching contrary to the law of the land, they answered: “We ought to obey God rather than men.”—Acts 5: 29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">♦ It has been stated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ad nauseam</span><span class="font3"> that the petroleum industry has brought into this country enormous capital for its development. This assertion is an exaggeration. The oil companies have enjoyed for many years, during most of their existence, in fact, great privileges for their development and expansion; they ha,ve been granted customs rebates, fiscal exemptions and numberless other prerogatives, and their privileges, joined to the gigantic potentialities of the oil fields granted to them by the nation, oftentimes against the will of the latter and in violation of the country’s laws, make up almost the whole of the actual capital so often talked about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The potential wealth of the nation, wretchedly underpaid native labor, exemptions from taxation, economic privileges and Government tolerance: these are the factors that built up the boom in the Mexican petroleum industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us now turn to the work done, in a social welfare sense, by the companies. How many of the villages near the oilfields possess such things as hospitals, schools, social centers, water supply, or purification plants, or athletic fields, or electric plants, even if only fed by the untold millions of cubic feet of natural gas wasted in oil operations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What center of oil activities, on the other hand, is not provided with a company police force, designed to safeguard private interests, invariably selfish and occasionally unlawful? Many stories are told about these organizations, whether authorized or not by the Government—stories of abuse, outrage and even murder, invariably for the benefit of the companies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">♦ In a special copyrighted radio dispatch to the Philadelphia </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> Richard Mowrer cites the Paris evening paper, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ce Soir,</span><span class="font3"> as reporting shipment of arms from Germany and Italy to Guatemala and Nicaragua, which arms are intended to promote a revolution in Mexico; also, that the money to pay for the arms came “from subscriptions collected by various Catholic quarters in the United States”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jerry J. O’Connell, Democratic liberal from Montana, backed this up in an address in Los Angeles in which he claimed that Germany, in January, of 1938, was supplying arms and ammunition for an army of 100,000 men then forming in the Guadalupe hills of Mexico under Gen. Saturnino Cedillo. Of course, the real objective of a Fascist state in Mexico would be to provide a base of operations against the liberties not merely of the Mexican people but of the whole North American continent, though any attack Mexico, even with German help, could make upon the United States would hardly rise higher than the level of a temporary annoyance.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Mexico Will Operate Oil Wells</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The Mexican Government, which expropriated all oil deposits and will operate them, in a note to Britain said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even on the assumption that numerous British investors are very much interested in the situation in which the company (Royal Dutch Shell) finds itself, the latter is a Mexican enterprise and therefore defense of its interests does not appertain to a foreign state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A huge sum of money to recompense foreign investors in oil stocks was raised by Government appeal. The United States Government has formally admitted that Mexico is entirely within its rights as a sovereign state in expropriating the oil and that all that can be demanded in return is a fair price for the properties seized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mexico deserves intelligent and sympathetic treatment at the hands of all countries that made use of its oil, and surely nothing is gained by a course of bulldozing such as was at one time considered good statesmanship, but earned only hatred.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ON Christmas Day this journal had occasion to refer to the scenes of horror perpetrated in Nanking following the occupation of that city by the victorious Japanese forces. It was then believed that the outrageous behavior of the troops was the result of temporary indiscipline, and the influence of blood lust aroused by the heat of battle. It was hoped that order would be rapidly restored and that the civilian population of Nanking would be relieved from the horrors they were suffering. It was even suggested in some quarters that the Japanese were taking revenge for the outrages of 1927, though, if indeed they were doing so, they were wreaking it upon the wrong people, for it was not the population of Nanking that was responsible, but the soldiery- To the astonishment of most people it is now learned that these outrages have been continued, and that ever since the occupation of Nanking until within the last few days, abduction of women, rape and looting have been carried on with an industry which would have done justice to a more praiseworthy cause. Chinese have been stabbed with bayonets, or recklessly shot. It is estimated that more than 10,000 people have been killed, some not even guilty of the trivial offense of having the hardihood to fight for their country. How many women have been raped it is impossible to ascertain, but the estimates vary from as low as 8,000 to as high as 20,000. Girls of as tender an age as eleven years, and women as old as fifty-three, have been the forced victims of military lust. Refugees have been robbed of their scanty supply of money, their clothing, bedding and food, and all this was still going on as late-as less than a week ago. In the initial stages insufficiency of military police rendered control of the disorderly soldiery impossible, More of such police have been appointed, but as late as a week ago soldiers were still breaking into houses day and night, indulging in rape and abduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Contrast that description of the state of affairs which has lasted in Nanking over a period of many weeks with the correctness of the attitude which Japan adopted in the case of the Sino-Japanese war, and the question naturally arises—why this change? There 20 -</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">have been no Chinese barbarities for which the Japanese could., possibly have taken revenge. If there had been it is suggested that the propriety of their action during the war referred to could with splendid effect have been adopted in this instance, and the Japanese army would have been regarded in a better light than that in which it appears at present. The Chinese people have been assured times out of number thpt Japan has no grievance against them, but that all it is doing is to chastise the National Government which it accuses of insincerity and imperiling the peace of Asia, and yet the unfortunate quarter of a million 'Chinese still remaining in Nanking have been subjected to weeks of terror, and what might have been regarded as an isolated case has developed into what seems almost to bea habit. Canitbe wondered at that the world stands aghast before such a thing? Is it surprising that it is difficult to believe that an army with such fine traditions as the Japanese can be guilty of such conduct? Yet the evidence that this is the case is overwhelming, and the fact that innocent, harmless Chinese civilians are being subjected to such hideous treatment is becoming plainer and plainer to the whole world. This story, despite the fact that Nanking is practically cut off from the rest of the world, will one day be known in all its horror. Much of it the world already knows; the rest will make sorry reading for generations to come, and in all earnestness it is suggested that the time has eome when a determined effort should be made by the authorities responsible for the conduct of these men to put a stop to such outrageous behavior. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—North-China Daily News.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>The Ravaging of Nanking</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The ravaging of Nanking by the mikado's troops was equal to anything done by Hitler’s troops at Guernica or Mussolini’s troops at Addis Ababa. In undertaking to uphold civilization against Communism the three great Fascist powers, Rome, Berlin, Tokyo, have shown a courage in massacring disarmed men, women and children that makes it eminently fitting that they should have sworn fidelity to each other and have received the '‘blessing” of the pope. ■</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Details of Nanking Atrocities</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">ifcjj ON December 15 Japanese soldiers broke into the Library Building of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. /» the University for the third time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They-assaulted four women on the &quot;* property, carried off two who were released after being violated and three who never returned. One thousand five hundred refugees were sheltering in the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On December 16 more than 30 women were assaulted in the Agricultural Economies Com-phund by soldiers who came repeatedly and in large numbers. The same night Japanese soldiers returned to the Library Building and demanded money, watches, and women at the point of the bayonet. Several women were assaulted on the premises, and the watchman . beaten because he had no girls ready for the soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On December 17 some soldiers broke into, the University Middle School. One frightened child was killed with a bayonet and another seriously wounded.. Eight women were violated. Soldiers climbed over the walls of this building day and night, with the result that the refugees became hysterical and did not ' sleep for three nights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On, December 21 seven Chinese men were dragged from the Library Building for forced labor though there was no suspicion that they had served as soldiers. Soldiers also broke into the University hospital and were removing the ambulance when stopped by an American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These are just isolated incidents quoted from a long list. All the time the looting continued and soldiers frequently forced poor , Chinese to carry the possessions which had been stolen from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thousands of refugees were starving because they had lost all their food and money, and bitterly cold because they had lost their clothing. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For some reason the Japanese soldiers, working in large groups under the direction of officers, systematically set fire to the poorer quarters, so that thousands of people were rendered homeless. Where refugees were gathered soldiers habitually came on “inspection,” which meant looking for women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The houses of foreigners were not immune and Japanese soldiers broke in freely. One American missionary was dragged out of bed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 13, 1»38 </span><span class="font3">in the middle of the night by a drunken soldier with a bayonet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After repeated protests had been made Japanese authorities began to promise that the situation would be remedied and discipline restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Proclamations were actually put up on gates and walls, but were torn down by the Japanese soldiers. As late as December 26, for instance, soldiers visited the Bible Teachers* Training School for Women, a place which had already suffered terribly, and took food, clothes and money. They also assaulted seven women, including a girl of 12. The same night another group of soldiers came and assaulted 20 women. Frequently, after many such visits, the refugees would have no more money and food left to give, and the soldiers would beat them for their “refusal”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the same night, December 26, three Japanese soldiers drove up to the main gate of the university in a ear and announced that they had orders to “inspect” the buildings. They forcibly prevented the watchman from giving alarm and took him with them while they found and assaulted three girls, one of whom was only 7 years old. One of the girls they took away with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yet all these incidents were only a fraction of the total and took place, indeed, where the situation was relatively good owing to the presence and “protection” of foreigners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is difficult to imagine the full extent of the terror and misery of the captured city. The latest reports are that the situation has now improved and that discipline has to a certain extent been restored. This seems due less to the good-will of the generals, who showed themselves utterly callous, than to the anxiety of the diplomatists at the reports which were beginning to reach the outer world in spite of censorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The improvement did not come until after nearly three weeks of brutality unparalleled even in this time.—Manchester Guardian.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At the Close of 1937</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the close of 1937 the Abys-sinnian flag was still flying in at least a half dozen cities, roadmaking had stopped, and the Italian soldiers were confined to their garrisons in the larger cities. No caravans were safe from attack. Such were the reports from the French port of Djibuti. The Italian investment in Ethiopia to date is a poor one. Exports which, in 1934, were about $5,000,000 have shrunk to almost nothing. A part of the exported surplus consisted of grain. Now Ethiopia cannot feed itself, to say nothing of feeding its conquerors, and the whole nation is on a sit-down strike against the Italians. Mussolini is making rapid progress to the port of nowhere. Give the man credit for one point, however. He dismissed Graziani as viceroy of Ethiopia because that extremely cruel and vicious person wanted permission to go ahead and butcher the whole Ethiopian nation. The only thing that can be said in Graziani’s behalf is that, on several occasions, detachments of as many as 200 Italian troops have gone out and never returned alive, and it looks as if bringing order out of chaos would be a long-continued operation.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Africa is rapidly obliterating its elephants, and the present generation will see them disappear. Last year 36,500 were slain. This is greatly in excess of their reproductive capacity. Hippopotami are also passing out. Between one thousand and two thousand of them were slain last year.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>Farida’s Distinction</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Farida, the young and beautiful Egyptian queen, has one distinction that not even Cleopatra enjoyed. Her picture appears on the postage stamps of her country. This is the first time that any Moslem queen’s photograph has been on public display.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">36,500 African Elephants Slain Yearly </span><span class="font3">♦ It is estimated that 36,500 elephants are slain in Africa yearly, 25,000 of these in the Congo region, for their ivory. It should be plain that in a few years, at the present rate, this interesting form of wild life will disappear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Fauvette the Warbler</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Fauvette the Warbler, otherwise Farida Zulflear, daughter of an Egyptian judge, is only sixteen years of age, but is now second queen of Egypt since the days of Cleopatra, and her hubby, the king, is only eighteen. He startled Europe by suddenly dismissing the popularly supported cabinet of Mustafa Nahas Pasha and attempted to establish himself as dictator. Oh, about Fauvette, she has some clothes all right, forty-five dresses, some of them as elaborate as those worn by a flock of prelates when doing their strut at a eucharistic idolatry congress, Bid you ever hear of a cardinal decked out better than this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A rose-peach garment embroidered with waterdrop pearls with a twenty-four-foot I am 6 train spangled with jewels and trimmed with blue velvet and ermine; with a brocade design of lotus foliage and a quarter moon inscribed in gold with a verse of the Koran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A gown of silver lace over satin, with an eightyard court train of shimmering silver lame and a sheer tulle veil eaught under a sparkling diadem. (The wedding gown)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Light blue Iam6 shimmering with pearl embroidery and hand-made pink lace; pale blue faille; blue fox furs; lingerie of gossamer lace and shimmering satin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mussolini’s Coptic Bishops</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Mussolini takes good care of his handpicked Coptic bishops. First, he put a blind man in as patriarch, probably after he had first received instructions from the pope. The next step was the installation and initiation of three bishops and three deacons. And then all seven of them were marched through Addis Ababa surrounded by Italian troops, and with machine-gunners leading and bringing up the rear. And so “civilization” lunges ahead in Ethiopia.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>Bombings in Ethiopia</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ In the three months of August, September and October, 1937, it required 113 airplanes to bomb and machine-gun the natives of Ethiopia into acquiescence with Italian rule, uprisings having occurred at least nine times, in as many different localities. About 100 Italians were killed in these bombings, and not less than 5,000 of the Ethiopians, army reports state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Young Mussolini</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Young Vittorio Mussolini, son of Benito Mussolini, and recently a guest of President Roosevelt, returned to Italy and put on sale his new book entitled “Flying Over</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ethiopian Mountain Ranges”. In this book he describes the destruction of a troop of Ethiopian cavalry in language which so perfectly shows the spirit of the Devil that it is worthy of being framed. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I remember that one group of horsemen gave me the impression of a budding rose as the bombs fell in their midst. It was exceptionally good fun, and they were easy to hit, as we were not too high up. They oSered a perfect target.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>Priest Blessed the Vessel</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Thanks to the Associated Press for the information that at Leghorn, Italy, November 21,1937, anti-Comm uni stie Italy launched a 3,00O-ton destroyer, the Tasehkent, for Communistic Russia, and that the occasion was sanctified by the “blessing” of an anti-Communist Catholic priest upon’the vessel which is probably intended to send some of his Italian comrades to Davy Jones’ locker, if, as supposed, they happen to be on one of those pirate submarines. It is a great world, with liars and hypocrites in most of the key positions.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>Prizes to Italian Mothers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Mussolini recently awarded prizes to the mothers in each of the 94 provinces that bore the most babies in the preceding 11 years 8 months. These mothers averaged 7.7 babies each, or at the rate of one every 18 months, but Signora Venia Er rani, of Ravenna, whose husband is in Spain fighting for the pope, had 13 babies in that time, and that is one every 11 months.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>Nothing Said About the Serpent</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The dispatch from Rome which tells about the “blessing” of elepliants connected with a eireus, together with pigeons, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, canaries, parrots, goldfish, horses and oxen makes one curious omission. Nothing was said about the “blessing” of the serpent. Maybe somebody in the menagerie chanced to remember at the last minute that the serpent was cursed, not blessed.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Germans in that portion of the Tyrol under Italian control are taught only Italian in the schools; and as they refuse to learn Italian, the children are growing up illiterate. German is forbidden in advertising or on public signs or on tombstones. The best lands of these German people were seized by the Italians for landing fields. In some villages the druggists and doctors assigned by the Italian government speak no German.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Just to remind the Italian people, and other people too, of his plain intent, Mussolini, on the new imperial road to the Forum, has a gigantic map of the old Roman Empire, showing North Africa, Egypt, Abyssinia, Palestine, Greece and Spain as part of it, and just at the moment has a huge army in North Africa that was certainly not needed there and was not sent there for its health.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The perfidy of the pope’s Italian statesmen may be seen in the open charge of the Spanish ambassador in London that huge quantities of flame-throwers, tanks and other munitions from Italy were landed for the “Rebels” at Cadiz “exactly as though the nonintervention pact and the committee of control did not exist”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy Preparing for European War</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Rushing preparations for the European war which he believes is just ahead, and which it is evident he desires, Mussolini has given orders that all youth between the ages of 16 and 19 enroll for pre-military training. Sixty-three barracks are in construction in as many cities, and 100,000 rifles have been ordered for their arming.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Hitler Ready for War? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The meaning and purpose of the National Socialist state is this alone and can be only this; to put the German people in readiness for the “coming war” by ruthless repression, elimination, extirpation of every stirring of opposition; to make' of them an instrument of war, infinitely compliant, without a single critical thought, driven by a blind and fanatical ignorance. Any other meaning and purpose, ■ any other excuse this system cannot have; all the sacrifices of freedom, justice, human happiness, including the secret and open crimes for which it has blithely been responsible, can be justified only by the end —absolute fitness for war. If the idea of war as an aim in itself disappeared, the system would mean nothing but the exploitation of the people; it would be utterly senseless and superfluous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Truth to tell, it </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> both of these, senseless and superfluous, not only because war will not be permitted it, but also because its leading idea, the absolute readiness for war, will result precisely in the opposite of what it is ’ striving for. No other people on earth is today so utterly incapable of war, so little in condition to endure one. That Germany would have no allies, not a single one in the world, is the first consideration, but the smallest. Germany would be forsaken—terrible, of course, even in her isolation—but the really frightful thing would be the fact she had forsaken herself. Intellectually reduced and humbled, morally gutted, inwardly torn apart by her deep mistrust of her leaders and the mischief they have done her in these years, profoundly uneasy herself, ignorant of the future, of course, but full of forebodings of evil, she would go into war in the condition of 1914 but, even physically, of 1917 or 1918. The 10 percent of direct beneficiaries of the system—half even of them fallen away—would not be enough to win a war in which the majority of the rest would only see the opportunity of shaking off the shameful oppression that has weighed upon them so long—a war, that is, which after the first inevitable defeat Would turn into a civil war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No, this war is impossible; Germany cannot wage it; and if its dictators are in their senses, then their assurances of readiness for peace are not tactical lies repeated with a wink at their partisans; they spring from a fainthearted perception of just this impossibility. But if war can not and shall not be—then why these robbers and murderers? Why isolation, world hostility, lawlessness, intellectual interdict, cultural darkness, and every other evil? Why not rather Germany’s voluntary return to the European system, her reconciliation with Europe, with all the inward accompaniments of freedom, justice, well-being, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hu</span><span class="font3">man decency, and a jubilant welcome from the rest of the world! Why not? Only because </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">regime which, in word and deed, denies the rights of man, which wants above all else to remain in power, would stultify itself and be abolished if, since it cannot make war, it actually made peace 1 But is that a reason ? —Thomas Mann, Ph.D., in The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>Faithful Witness in Germany</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Faithful witnesses in Germany continue to put forth their best endeavors to serve Jehovah. The following is a resolution adopted by an assembly of them at the recent Memorial:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“On the day of the Memorial we desire to express our intimate relationship to you and to the whole beloved company of brethren on earth. We rejoice in the great privilege to be equipped for the battle as is written in Jeremiah 51:11. In spite of persecution and prison we share and .drink together today with God’s people the wine of joy. Many in the belly of the great fish are happy to have this protection from Jehovah, and they join their greetings with ours and express that we shall continue to fight with you and all the faithful ‘as a city that is compact together’ until the end of victory.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>Life in Frankfort</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ I spent much time in Germany and Austria in my two years over there, and only the week-end before I left Paris I was in Frankfort. Frankfort is an old and intellectual city. Life goes on placidly there on the surface, and even underneath there is no apparent opposition. Furthermore, I don’t believe there can be any opposition. The Nazis prevent gatherings of more than two, and all public meetings are banned. No one dares talk to his neighbor. Friends of mine have disappeared and never been heard of again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Individual feeling is, of course, another matter. There is no white bread, no butter in Frankfort. They lack many other necessities. Nazis are everywhere, and individuals are silent and therefore divided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I’ll give you an illustration of how the Nazis work. While in Frankfort I attended a performance of an old play, “Don Carlos.” To give the background, it tells the story of Philip II of Spain at a time when the Netherlands were under his thumb.

<h4><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>Hitler’s Statement in 1932</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ What will Britain, France, and America say, once I am chancellor? But I do not care what they think. Austria will be the first fruit to drop in my lap, I shall settle things with Signor Mussolini myself. If Britain opposes a Greater Germany, I still think that Signor Mussolini might be interested in making Germany so strong that, together, we &gt;might force John Bull to his knees. If it is going to take bombs to show these gentlemen in London, Paris, and New York that I mean business, they can have them. I will go the limit when the time comes—but not before, I see the German Reich stretching from the North Sea to the Urals without a Stalin.—Kurt G.. W,.

<h4><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>Colonia Agrippina .After 1887 Years</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The wife of the Roman Emperor Claudius was born in the ancient and honorable city of Oppidum Ubiorum. To please her the emperor renamed the city after her in the year 51 (A,D.) and in due time the name Colonia Agrippina became shortened to Cologne. Cologne, therefore, is supposed to have been civilized for about 2,000 years. But a dreadful thing happened to it: it fell into the hands of the Nazis. And with that, civilization disappeared and brutality reappeared. The following, from the pen of Eva Lips, wife of Professor- Lips [now associated with Columbia University, and head of the Anthropology Department at Howard University], tells how Nazi rule affects the same in a madhouse:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I had become so intimidated that I no longer knew what was right and what was wrong. If anyone had forbidden me to play on my own piano I should have ceased playing, like a guilty school girl. If my clothing had been confiscated I should have thought I had come by it dishonestly. The supervised telephone would ring. I no longer laughed over the most trivial conversations, sines they took place within earshot of an invisible enemy. Our letters arrived opened, and I read them with a feeling that I was doing something incriminating, although they were as harmless as a child's story book.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>Hoover Snubs Adolf</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Ex-President Herbert Hoover snubbed Adolf in beautiful style on his recent visit to Berlin. In Hitler’s own office Hoover told him. he was bringing on a war that would throw Europe into an abyss, and afterwards flatly refused to attend a lunch which the Reich dictator had specially arranged for him. On arrival in Warsaw Mr. Hoover stated to a newspaper correspondent that General Goering impressed him more than any other German leader, and reminded him of Al Capone. Invited to visit Stalin in Moscow, Mr. Hoover declined, stating that to interview one dictator in Europe was enough for him and more than he could digest. Attaboy!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>Use of Austrian Ore</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ German use of Austrian ore followed immediately the seizure of the latter country. The Herman Goering Works, founded a year ago for exploiting German ores of inferior grade, increased its share capital from 5,000,000 marks to 400,000,000 marks and will establish works at Linz, Austria.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">♦ I am very sorry over conditions in my native land today. The government is being conducted by nothing less than crazy men. These men are able to continue in office because they use terroristic methods. And where there is terror you will not find music, art, literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At our new home in Switzerland, where so many German artists, writers and musicians are now in exile, including such non-Jewish Germans as myself and Thomas Mann, the novelist, I was once approached by a Nazi official who urged that I come back to Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He said I could have anything I wanted. I refused, telling him I would never go back to Germany until Hitler, Goebbels and Goering were hanged. The man disappeared and I never heard from him again. I repeat that statement today.—Adolf Busch, noted German violinist, in an interview in Chicago.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>Seizure of Austria</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The Germans have made many important contributions, but none more fascinating than the principle behind Hitler’s recent plebiscite on the seizure of Austria. This one should be a great comfort to all criminals, for it holds that after a pickpocket has stolen a watch he may call the operation a rescue, vote himself title to the watch and prosecute the owner for having possessed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we are a normal people the Germans think upside down. According to their mentality, a report of a bank robbery would say, “Three armed rescuers held up the First National Bank, executed the cashier and two clerks for resisting destiny and rescued $150,000. They then held a plebiscite and unanimously voted ‘Ja’ on the proposition ‘Shall we keep the money?’ ”—Westbrook Pegler, in the New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram,</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>Celebration of Theft</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ At the celebration, April 9, of the German grabbing of Austria every German who could walk had to be out on parade, behind all the German bands. All public and private buildings had to display flags. All activity ceased for two minutes. All war airplanes took to the air to fly over the principal cities. All church bells rang. All whistles on locomotives and workshops blew, and all vessels at home and abroad had to dress ship.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>Iron Fences Follow Shirttails</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ Cutting off the men's shirttails is not enough to suit the new Germany, All iron fences must be taken down, broken up, melted and turned into cannon, and such other things as Hitler desires. In Germany today no old papers may be burned: the government needs them for refashioning into clothing and other essentials. For every tree cut down two must be planted in its place. All the old automobile tires are salvaged. Nothing is wasted. All this is commendable, as far us teaching saving is concerned, and yet it is one of the indications of insanity when one goes to extremes of frugality. Nature’s God is profuse, not parsimonious, in the bestowal of blessings, and under His Kingdom there will be plenty for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Prophecies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The objectives set out in Hitler’s book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font3"> were as follows: (a) withdrawal of Germany from the League of Nations, (b) rearmament of Germany, (c) remilitarization of the Rhineland, (d) seizure of Austria, (e) restoration to Austria of the states that once constituted the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, (f) seizure of the Russian Ukraine. The accomplishment of (a), (b), (c) and (d) is a matter of history. Do you suppose Hitler will forget (e) and (f) ?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>The Anthill Shelters</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ With the relapse of Europe into a condition of savagery far worse than in the days of Attila the Hun, the Germans figured out an anthill shelter for housing civilians in case of gas attack. The shelters are 90 feet high, circular, cone-shaped, and will each shelter 600 people. Inside is a spiral stairway, a central gangway for passage of food and drink, and a central air shaft for drawing in fresh air from the top, above the poison-gas level. The concrete walls are five feet thick.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>End of German Freedom Party</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">♦ The German Freedom Party came to its end by the arrest of 46 men and women, belonging to all classes of society, hoping for deliverance from Nazi rule and doing what they could to wake the German people up. They will probably be beheaded for giving news which the State forbids, asking awkward questions, etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">'TAN loves to travel in unknown nids. The nature-lover, if fortunate nough to be able to undertake tong jurneys, not only visits charming daces, where in a temperate climate he can enjoy the benefit of every modern comfort, but also seeks adventure in desolate regions, in sandy deserts or icy wastes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because the elements seem to defy him he enters into a struggle against them, a contest so terrible in its nature that often his Hfe is in danger. How many of these intrepid explorers have been killed by hunger or thirst, by cold or heat, or by the natives 1 But others there are who meet with final triumph, and snatch their secrets from a thousand threatening solitudes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greenland has been the goal of numerous scientific expeditions. One of our friends who has gone there briefly describes his journey thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We embark at Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, which country colonised Greenland in 1721, Odr boat speedily gains the high seas. Although the sun shines, the cold makes us shiver. However, we quickly get accustomed to the keen, healthful air of the open sea. The land which for some time had been but a gray streak on the horizon, separating the sky from the earth, has disappeared, swallowed up in a blue mist. And now we are for long days alone in the immensity of the sea. This impression of loneliness grips the heart of the most hardened. The rays of the setting sun gild the crests of the tiny waves. That ealm sea, apparently so inoffensive, does not dispel a sense of uneasiness. One knows that the anger of the billows is as sudden as it is formidable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The believer delivered over to their mercy remembers the words spoken by the prophets as they extolled the power of God. Said Jeremiah, ‘It is the Lord which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar.* (Jeremiah 31:35) King David wrote, ‘He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.* (Psalm 33: 7) One day the Lord said to Job, ‘Who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth as if it had issued out of the womb? When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, and brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, and said, Hitherto sholt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?’—Job 38:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Here we are in Greenland. Our ship casts anchor off the west coast, and we land. This island, the largest in the world, has a surface of 2,143,000 square kilnmeters (about 827,300 square miles). Ninety - five percent of this is covered with ice. Only two narrow strips of coastline are habitable. The one in the west has a breadth varying from 40 to 100 kilometers (i.e., about 25 to 60 miles). The one in the east has an averag? breadth of 22 kilometers (about 14 miles). Life is found only on these strips of land, the surface of which is 88,000 square kilometers. All the remainder is an immense stretch of eternal ice and snow. The east coast, more so than the west, is pierced by deep fjords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the summer, which ts very short, the temperature reaches 46 degrees Fahrenheit. In the south of the island, and only there, a perpetual thaw lasting three months allows moss, together with some willows and stunted birch trees, to grow with difficulty. In that part of the island a little gardening is done to a limited extent; and in the very poor soil a few bushes, which give scanty fruit, are cultivated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fauna Is reduced to a few animals — dog, reindeer, polar hare, blue fox and white bear. Bird fife Consists of sea gull, petrel and eider duck. The sea provides whale, seal and every variety of fish. In the north the polar wolf and the musk goat are to be met. Explorers have found traces of former luxuriant vegetation; and this discovery coincides with the Biblical revelations concerning the Deluge,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Greenland was discovered in the ninth century by the Norwegian Gunbjoern, and was colonized on the east coast by the islanders. Then for several centuries it was inhabited only by Esquimaux, and had no further contact with the civilized world. It was rediscovered by Davis and Hudson in the 16th century, and finally claimed by Denmark. At the end of the 15th century (?) the colony was almost entirely destroyed by English pirates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was not until 1775 that travelers other than the Danes ventured to Greenland. The present total population is 14,355, of whom 14,000 are Esquimaux and the others Europeans. The rough struggle for existence has put its own stamp on the faces of the natives. How, then, those explorers must suffer who are not accustomed to the intense cold! Up to the present the material advantages of the scientific expeditions have been </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We know that the curse of these uninhabited countries is temporary. A day will come, says the prophet Isaiah, when the Lord wilt cause rivers to spring forth in the burning sandy deserts, and there and also in the snowy wastes He will cause to grow the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, the olive tree, the aypress, the elm, the box, the rose of Sharon, and every description of flower; and in the formerly accursed lands will be heard songk of gladness and shouts of triumph.—Isaiah 55:1,2; 41:18,19.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> J. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">H emery {London)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">B</span><span class="font3">RITAIN, in common with many parts of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Europe, has had a severe time of drought: the floods of February and the spring rains have been absent. But there has been a torrent of talk in the religious &quot;world” and its associated institutions, as is usual at this season of the year. The Church of England has its two Houses of Convocation; one for the province of York, the other for the province of Canterbury, and these in session provide the parsons for the necessary outlet. The Roman Catholic section of religion has its meetings private to itself; it meets according to direction, and is under control. It is the nonconformist part which holds its various and varied meetings, partly for business purposes, but also to enable the leaders to make speeches. It would be a strange thing if the kingdom of God were not -mentioned by the speechmakers, for, professedly all these sections of religion are trying to bring in that kingdom; but it is a safe guess that the numbers of those in attendance are more in the dark about the kingdom of God than they were. If the truth is not held, the more the talk, the darker the night; and as all these so-called “Christian religions” hold that it is the task set by Christianity to bring in the kingdom of heaven, a self-appointed task, and directly contrary to the teaching of Jesus, the Head of the church, it is evident that they are in the dark, and that the leaders are as the Pharisees and scribes of Jesus’ day, blind leaders of the blind; “and if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”—Matthew 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The published reports of the meetings show that the leaders of the non-conformist sects, in common with the Church of England, are alarmed by the apathy of the people towards religion; they are concerned for their own interests as well as for the kingdom of heaven. They see that to safeguard those interests religion must get a solid front to present before the people, and this at the moment is a very pressing matter with them. They see quite well that the people know that that which they talk of as the kingdom of heaven does not obtain amongst the religionists, disagreeing as they do about things which are of no importance to anyone but serve only to keep up their various systems. These meetings are held in favor by the men who are prominent in the various systems and by the younger ' men who seek to rise in the estimation of their fellows: they provide a great opportunity for showing their ability. Each seeks to say something of importance to their business of religion, and in the public sessions to tell the world how sincerely they desire its betterment, and to get the world into such a condition as that it might be said the kingdom of heaven had come. The plain fact is that God never set a multitude of teachers in His . church, and this crowd of “reverends” and their ‘principal men’, most of whom are modernists, unfaithful to the Word of God, are self-appointed and do not speak for Him. They do not know His will, and do not attempt to declare it, but speak for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is doing no injustice to the non-conformist section of religion to say that its pastors and teachers differ little from Papacy in that which they present as the purpose of religion. The Church of Rome professes to seek the moral and physical welfare of its children; and if the church and the &quot;holy father” are acknowledged, and mass attended, at least on the special occasions, the blessing of the church in life and death, and after, may be expected. The Church of England has never reckoned to do much more than provide a place for the people to worship, and the necessary priest to conduct the services set by State ordinances. The parson is there to baptize the infants; the bishop goes to confirm the baptism of such as are come to years of responsibility, and after that attendance at Church and a moral life is sufficient to satisfy the church, and to assure a burial in consecrated ground. Of late years, however, many of the Church of England parsons, faced in their urban parishes with terrible conditions in the lives of the people, victims in so many cases of the hardships which have come through the greed of commerce, have tried to do something for the hardly pressed people near them. But the Church, as an organization, does no more than the Church of Rome, and both of these huge systems would have the people believe that the kingdom of God would be realized if the people would put themselves under the rule of their priests hnd ijegularly attend the church services. As to the actual benefits of the kingdom of heaven, it never rises higher in the conception of the churches than that of the moral and physical well-being of their adherents. Nor do the nonconformists rise higher than this; but they arB political agitators who would have Parliament enact laws to better the conditions of the people. Attendance at preaching services, profession of acceptance of Christ as the Savior, and amendment of conditions which keep the people in distress, is their idea of bringing in the kingdom of heaven. ।</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But all this talk of making the world better, and of putting religion to that purpose, by getting men to be religious, proves that which Judge Rutherford has broadcast to the whole earth, namely, that religion is a part of the world system, and is the enemy of Christianity; that religion and big business and polities are the three main factors of the world, and that it is by these three instruments, the Devil, who has been the overlord of the world, has kept his rule. Jesus made a definite distinction between himself and His disciples, and the world, when He said, “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” (John 17:16) It is evident that He did not mean merely to make a distinction as between law-abiding religious men and men who break the laws of God and humanity recklessly. The world which was opposed to Jesus, and from which He called His disciples to separate them to the service of God, was that which rejected Him, namely, the Jewish religionists, the Roman pagan world, .and everything represented thereby. That time is now repeated: the general circumstances are identical with those of Jesus’ day, and the attitude of religionists now is as it was then towards the proclamation of the truth concerning the kingdom of God, now being made by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">IN A recent discussion in the House of Lords on the Coal Bill, which will force amalgamation on certain mines, and which proposes to pay out coal mining royalties on the basis of 15 years’ purchase, the archbishop of Canterbury said the Church of England would lose £50,000 per year by the bill, if passed. However, he would not oppose the passage of the bill through Parliament. He said that the stipends of the elergy would be affected, some of whom are hard pressed through the poverty of their parishes. A writer of an open letter to the archbishop reminds him that the income of the Church of England approximates to £13,000,00)0 per year, nearly half of the amount coming from voluntary offerings. Property and investments under the charge of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners brings in about £3,500,000, and the remainder of the amount, is got from fees, legacies, and other property of the church, and the archbishop is told that the loss on royalties to the establishment is only about one penny in the £.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">' There are about 13,000 heneficed clergy in the Church of England. The archbishop of Canterbury gets £15,000 per year; he of York, £9,000; the bishop of London, £10,000. The average parish parson gets about £350 per year. There are great differences in the range of the remuneration the clergy get: there are plums in the service, as, for instance, the rector of St. Verdast church in the city of London receives £1,040 per year for ‘ministering to the needs’ of 45 people; the rector of Christian Malford church, Bristol, has a stipend of £965 per year for ‘ministering’ to a population of 495 persons; and the rector of St. Peter upon Cornhill, who has 62 parishioners, gets $1,020 per year. Hundreds of vicars and rectors receive less than £300 per year, serving in large parishes, and very many receive upward of £1,000 per year in parishes which are little better than sinecures. Some time ago the bishop of London wrote to the newspapers to tell that he is but a poor man although his stipend is £10,000 per year. He has to keep a palace at Fulham, and has to pay considerable sums for help in the bishopric; but there is a vast difference between poverty on the £10,000-a-year scale and that at £300. But these “dignitaries” of the church are ‘princes’ in the earth, and they must keep up their style, and the others should be pleased to suffer their poverty for the sake of the establishment to which they belong. And speaking of ‘princes of the church’—a newspaper, when giving a report of the Royal Academy dinner just past, said the cardinal archbishop of Westminster in his new scarlet robe Was the most striking person present. One up for the Roman Church.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>The Parsons</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The vicar of Littlehampton, Sussex, has announced his intention to invite local motorists to bring their cars to his church on Rogation Sunday. He hopes, he says, to do something to help in the reduction of road accidents. He will walk past the cars reciting “prayers”, will “bless” them, and will sprinkle them with “holy water”. Does the viear really believe that his action will do anything besides bring ridicule? Perhaps he has allowed himself to become so deluded with his man-made priestly office as to imagine that even in this he can act for high heaven, and that after the “blessing” both driver and car will be preserved ; perhaps he thinks the “saint” after whom his “church” is named will help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rogation Sunday is a special day in the ehurch calendar. It has persisted from the fifth century, from the time when the religionists in places of authority in the growing system of organized religion began to look about for others’ acts of mummery by which the people could be kept in delusion. The special day is the Sunday before “Ascension Day”, the fortieth after &quot;Easter Sunday”; fasting is enjoined, and the day is supposed to be one of special supplication. It is customary in the three chief systems <sup>s</sup>or the priest to lead a procession round the church, a reminder that the building, like the clergy, is consecrated. Perhaps the vicar will include the cars in the ‘sacred’ enclosure made by his walk, and, with the aid of the “holy water”, make the cars “holy” also. There ought to be some better running. When an apparently sane man has got a delusion he can almost always get others to share it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>The Dictators and Britain</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini have met in Rome, have had their show and their talks, and both are back to the work they have set for themselves. The only item of general importance that has been made public is Hitler’s declaration of his will concerning the border line of Germany and Italy. He said, “It is. my will that the present border line shall be inviolable.” He speaks as if he were a potentate with authority to declare his will. The words surely mean, “I Will not attack you, and also I will see that you do not come over the line.” How much these men trust each other’s word, only they know; but it may be taken for granted that neither trusts the other. They are not partners in a common scheme, but are rivals, openly professing friendship; each is a ready breaker of agreements whenever any agreement is in the way of their schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the Rome talks were on there was a similar meeting in London: the British and French premiers met for conference. The result was an agreement between Britain and France on several matters in which both countries are obligated; but as a joint representation to the Czech government followed the conference, urging that the Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia should receive generous consideration, no doubt Hitler’s purpose of creating a great Germany to include all the peoples in central Europe, was the main question. The British premier shows no signs of being sympathetic with Nazism or Fascism, but he Is certainly friendly toward the two dictators. Neither Britain nor France wants to fight for Czechoslovakia, and it is a safe conjecture that when Hitler gets something going in that country that will give him a chance to get a part of that country for Germany, the British and the French governments will tell Prague that the advice given them ought to have been followed, and that the two governments cannot interfere with Germany’s action. Hitler has become a dupe of Satan; has allowed himself to believe his work for Germany is of divine appointment. He uses the word God, but he does not mean the God of the Scriptures, the Creator, the Most High, but one of his own imaginings. He will push his schemes while he has the opportunity, and according to his own bible, his book If ein </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kampf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Britain and the lives of the people are involved. The dreaded outbreak of war continues to be put off; but active war preparations must go on, and the clouds of war are always darkening the skies. Those who have learned that this is the day of Jehovah in which He is fulfilling the prophecies of His Word watch all these movements with the certain knowledge that He is bringing the nations into line for His judgments, and, as His witnesses, they are telling the truth abroad so that all persons of good will may find safety In the “cities of refuge”. There is no human refuge or organization where safety can be found, but now there is the particular fulfillment of the Scripture which says, “The name of' [Jehovah] is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.”— Proverbs 18; 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font3">HE majority of the Mexican people are Iijdians. A majority ate likewise engaged in agriculture, and agriculture may,- from thflkt standpoint, be considered the chief in-„ dustry of Mexico. The soil and climate of the • . -country are particularly suitable to agriculture. The outstanding crop is corn, of which some 300,000,000 bushels are produced yearly. Corn is the main food of the Mexican peo-pie, and without corn, or a good crop of it each year, the people would be in dire straits. There has never been a failure of this crop, however, due to the favorable climatic conditions, and also because a great many varieties of corn are raised. In some parts of Mexico .the com will mature even though no rain falls during the growing season, the plant depending upon moisture lying deep in the , ground as a result of winter, rains. In other sections the com will thrive upon the heavy dew or mist, reminding us of the conditions that appear to have existed in the earth generally before the flood, when no rain fell.— Genesis 2:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Mining, in some respects equaling if not exceeding in importance the agricultural activity of the Mexicans, continues to be a source of Mexican wealth.

Mexico is still an important silver-producing country, and was at one time the greatest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mexico, before the “civilized” white man appeared in this part of the world, was a highly developed civilization, the history of which is lost in the mists of antiquity. Yet, increasingly, evidences of wonderful accomplishments are brought to light, and the unearthed relics of that bygone and almost forgotten age testify that the Indians of Mexico in many respects equaled, if they did not excel, their white .conquerors in material and intellectual attainments.</span></p>
