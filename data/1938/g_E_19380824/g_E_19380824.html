<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Factor of Safety in the Human Body</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">IN calculating the strength of nlw supports in the construction of bridges and buildings, architects always provide a large margin of safety. The strength of beams, pillars, trusses and foundations must be not merely sufficient to sustain the weight or strain that they must carry, but far more than sufficient to support the greatest weight or strain to which they can under any possibility be subjected. The builder gives to the supports and pillars five to ten times the strength required to support the weight which they ordinarily bear. This would seem to be an enormous waste of material, an unnecessary expenditure, but experience has shown it to be essential for safety. Emergencies occur w which bring unexpected strain and stress upon supports and foundations. Then, too, allowance must be made for the natural deterioration which comes with age; for buildings, as well as human bodies, grow old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The animal body, considered as a machine, is by far the most economical of all mechanisms. The most economical engine ever constructed does not at all compare with the body in economy shown in the use of fuel. Moreover, when we consider the question of the safety factor in the human body, we find margins of safety far greater than those which are provided in bridges and buildings. For example: Most of the important organs of the body are in pairs, and each one of each pair is more than capable of doing all the work ordinarily required of the two. This is true, for example, of the lungs, the kidneys, the adrenal glands of the kidneys and thyroid glands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of the heart during violent muscular action, when the muscles require a greatly increased supply of blood, may be increased to five times the work required in a state of rest, and, in young and healthy subjects, without the slightest injury to the.body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">U,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some of the orgahs of internal secretion the margin of safety amounts to ten or fifteen times the ordinary need. The eliminative power of the kidneys is far beyond that usually required. For example: A man of average size, living upon a natural diet, normally eliminates through the kidneys two or three pints of fluid daily. By copious water drinking, this amount may be readily increased to four or five quarts; and in cases of disease, as, for example, diabetes insipidus, the enormous quantity of fifteen or twenty quarts of liquid may be passed daily through the kidneys, and this may be continued for many years without apparent injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This large factor of safety is provided, evidently, not to furnish man with a means of unnecessary and extravagant expenditure of vital energy, but for the purpose of enabling him to cope with emergencies, and, most of all, to provide for the necessary deterioration which results from use, thus postponing the fatal day which inevitably comes to every machine, natural or artificial, when the mechanism is worn out at last in some vital point and hence is no longer able to perform its functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is clear that a large margin of safety is essential to great longevity. The man who has the largest margin of safety possesses in this natural endowment a vital capital of the greatest value. This wide margin between the demand which he must make from hour to hour and day to day upon his vital mechanism and the far greater demand which he may make if occasion requires, not only gives to him an unusual degree of stamina and endurance and hence of efficiency when a maximum amount of energy is demanded, but is also </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">guarantee, barring accident, of an extension of activity and efficiency to the maximum limit of time; in other words, of the greatest possible longevity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is evident, then, that a wide margin of safety is not only a most desirable thing to possess, but is something which should in every possible way be conserved and, if possible, improved upon. Certainly nothing could be more unwise than the useless curtailment of one’s vital safety margin. This question is one which frequently comes to the surgeon for decision; as, for example, in severe affections of the kidneys in which one kidney is known to be seriously diseased, while the other remains healthy. A healthy man can get along very well with one kidney; even two-thirds of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">kidney will perform all the kidney work ordinarily demanded. The writer recalls such a case, in which the removal of a kidney was found necessary, and in twenty-four hours the one kidney which remained was found to be doing more and better work than both kidneys were doing before the operation. But the vital question which interests the surgeon who is about to remove the kidney is this: What is the condition of the other kidney ? More than one patient has lost his life'after this operation because the one kidney left was unable to do the work required of it. Nowadays the surgeon employs means to inform himself of the exact state of each kidney before the operation; for.he knows that unless at least a small margin of safety is left, an operation is likely to lead very speedily to a fatal result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A most important question, one in which every intelligent human ought to be interested, is: How large a part of his original endowment of safety margin still remains? A man absolutely without resources upon a desert island with a limited food.supply may live as long as the food supply lasts, but must certainly die soon after. The very same principle applies to every person as regards his margin of safety. So long as there is a little margin left beyond what the body momentarily requires, one may continue to live; but when one’s margin of safety is exhausted, death is momentarily impending. A small extra demand upon the body resources, such as that involved in a short run to eatch a street car, a slight cold, a slight indiscretion in eating, bowel inactivity leading to intestinal toxemia, the loss of a night’s sleep, an extra cup of coffee, an extra cigar, an extra bottle of wine, or an-extra glass of beer—any slight extra draft upon the bodily mechanism may be sufficient to snap the brittle thread of life and end all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thousands of men and women have so small </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font5">a margin of safety that they would be terror-stricken if it could be graphically portrayed to them. These are the people who suddenly collapse, who are reported to die of heart failure. An eminent English authority classified such people as belonging to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">morituri. </span><span class="font5">A discreet surgeon is always on the lookout for such patients and declines to operate when he finds the margin of safety reduced to a narrow limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The tobacco user comforts himself with the idea that when he finds tobacco is hurting him, he will quit its use. He says to one who condemns the use of tobacco on principle because it is a poison, “Tobacco doubtless injures some people, but it doesn’t hurt me. I am not such a fool as to injure my body. When I find tobacco is hurting me, I will give it up.” This sounds very well, seems philosophic and reasonable, but as a matter of fact it is a most dangerous sort of sophistry. A tobacco user never finds out that tobacco is hurting him until his margin of safety is used up. He may be likened to a man whose life depends upon a limited store of food, and who has no means of knowing how much he has left, his food being doled out to him day by day as he needs it. Such a man, when expostulated with because .of extravagant waste of food, might reply with the argument of the tobacco user, ‘When I find my food supply getting short, I will cease my wasteful habits.” Unfortunately, when he gets to the point where his food supply is insufficient to satisfy his hunger, he will be close to the end. The time to begin to husband his food supply was when the storehouse was full, instead of waiting until only a morsel remained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The man who uses tobacco, or the man who indulges in any other practice which squanders vital energy, is able to indulge in these wasteful excesses only because he still possesses a margin of safety. He does not appreciate the fact that he is being damaged, because so long as his margin of safety lasts he is not conscious of the harm that is being done. When he discovers that tobacco-using is hurting him, it will be when his- margin of safety is consumed. He makes the discovery that he has suffered loss and damage only when the damage is irreparable; for when the margin of safety has been consumed in the extra effort which the body has been compelled to make in defending itself against the ravages of nicotine, it is gone for ever ; it cannot be replaced. There may still be left a small margin suffi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">cient to enable him to live for a time under favorable conditions, but the greater part of the vital capital with which he was originally endowed and which was intended to give him long life and efficiency in advanced years has been squandered and destroyed, and can never be regained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The exact amount of safety margin left cannot be accurately measured, it is true, but it is nevertheless a fact that a reasonably accurate estimate can be made by practical tests. As before remarked, the margin of safety provides not only for length of life, but also for emergencies. It is one of the elements of endurance. A proper test of a man’s muscular endurance, for example, is not the amount he ean lift—this is simply a test of the size and strength of his muscles—but' rather the number of lifts he ean make. A man may be able to lift a very large weight which another man cannot lift, and yet the weaker man may be able to lift a smaller weight for a long time after the stronger man is completely exhausted and is no longer able to lift a weight of the same size; so a weaker man may accomplish, through his greater endurance, more work in the aggregate than the strong man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The smoker can obtain information respecting the state of his margin of safety by submitting himself to a test of endurance. For example, if he wishes to know whether tobacco is doing him injury, before making the discovery .when it is too late, let him try this experiment: After smoking two cigars, let him run half a mile. If under thirty years of age, he should make as good time as possible. A ’ person over thirty years of age should make such an experiment with some care; that is, the pace should be moderate. Now, abstain from tobacco for three or four days, in the meantime drinking two or three quarts of water a day so as to eliminate as far as possible the poisonous nicotine which has been stored up in the system and which is daily eating up the margin of safety. After three or four days of abstinence, repeat the experiment and note the difference in the ease with which the run is made, the better time, freer breathing, the lessened excitement of the heart, and the lessened sense of exhaustion afterward. No sprinter dare smoke. No athlete who is in training for an athletic contest is permitted by his trainer to smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is true of tobacco-using is true of every other practice that unnecessarily expends vital energy, that taxes unnecessarily </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 24, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the poison-destroying and poison-eliminating functions of the body. The fact that many peo-pie are able to indulge in smoking and other injurious habits for a considerable number of years does not in the smallest degree indicate that these things are wholesome or harmless, but merely the fact that the particular individuals concerned are by nature endowed with unusually large margins of safety. Men . and women differ in relation to the safety factor just as they differ in intelligence, in aptitudes, in physical and mental qualities of various sorts. The idea that anybody may with impunity make use of a drug or indulge a habit which is known to produce harmful effects in a considerable number of persons and upon animals subjected to test experiments is utterly absurd. Human tissues are essentially alike. What is poison to one is poison to another. So-called “idiosyncrasies” are merely cases of special susceptibility; that is, the fact that some persons cannot eat eggs without suffering from distressing symptoms of acute poisoning is not due to the fact that these persons are so organized that what is perfectly wholesome food for other persons is to them a rank poison, but because all eggs contain substances which, under certain circumstances, may act as virulent poisons. The defensive functions of the body are sufficiently active in most persons to prevent the development of toxic symptoms when eggs are used, but certain persons lack this defensive ability and consequently suffer from ill effects when eggs are eaten. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tea and coffee drinkers, users of beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages, meat eaters, , persons who are subject to constipation, those who neglect to maintain heart and lung activity by daily bodily muscular exercise out of doors, those who rob themselves of sufficient opportunity for sleep and rest, or who subject themselves to the destructive influence of exhausting vital drains—such persons are rapidly using up their safety margin, which, when once lost, can never be regained. Many such persons may be likened to those walking close to the edge of a precipice—the smallest misstep will plunge them to destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The margin of safety is one of the most precious of all our natural endowments, and should be most carefully and conscientiously conserved by the cultivation of right habits of life—by “natural” living.—John Harvey Kellogg, M.D., LL.D., F.A.C.S., superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Consolation for the Sick</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Dr. X stood on a cold street comer one damp December day; the wind blew and the cement was icy underfoot. It was most uncomfortable, and to while away the time until the person for whom he was waiting appeared ■ he examined the passers-by with the critical eyes of a physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Down the street toward him came a young girl of 15 or 16. Her galoshes Sapped open, disclosing the thinnest of slippers and openwork stockings of the most transparent weave. Above that she wore a rather light wool skirt, and higher still a hip-length fur jacket, with yards of rabbit fur piled around her neck, almost burying her face, and the whole ensemble topped by a pancake hat. As she passed him she shivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Now that’s strange,” thought Dr. X. “I was always taught to keep my feet warm and my head cool, but this young creature is reversing the process. No wonder she’s shivering.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the day passed the picture of this silly child remained in his mind, and that evening, when he returned home, he began to reason the matter to a conclusion. “If in the winter,” he reasoned, “I have heated my room to a temperature of sixty degrees while outside there prevails a temperature of only five degrees and I leave the window of my room open, the warmth will pass out and the cold will come in until the room is as cold as the outside air. The same must be true of the body. The blood has a temperature of about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The ground in winter, on the other hand, has a temperature of from four degrees below zero to forty degrees above. Stone is still colder; colder than that is cement, and coldest of all is ice. Now if I, with my 98.6 degrees, stand or walk for a long time on the cold ground, or, worse than that, on stone, cement; or ice, then the heat is bound to pass down from my body and the cold will come up into me. When this happens the lower organs, and especially the kidneys, will first be deprived of their heat, which passes down through the legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The function of the kidneys is to separate the urine, and through two canals to lead it to the bladder, which then gets rid of the urine through the natural passage from the body. If the kidneys have been deprived of a part of their heat through the cold, they can no longer function, just as a saucepan cannot boil properly if the fire is too weak. The result is that the urine is not properly separated or that too little urine passes off; and the urine that has not been passed, or the matter deposited from the urine, enters the blood, where it does not belong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This is the beginning of a very serious chain of events. For, just as a dirt-laden river will carry the dirt as long as the water flows swiftly, and drops it when the flow becomes slower, the blood stream will retain its poisons, Until the circulation is retarded. A chill will retard the flow of the blood stream, causing it to deposit its' freight of poisons; it will also drive the blood into the deeper parts of the body by causing the contraction of the blood vessels in the skin and muscles. This puts an added strain on the already laboring kidneys, interferes further with the separation of poisons from the blood, and these poisons are deposited in the weakest areas of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If these poisons or acids settle in the head, we find catarrh, inflamed eyes, pain in the ears, head noises, headache, sleeplessness, or disturbance of the brain. When we remove the poisons, so that they no longer irritate the nerves, these conditions disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If one has a weakness of the lungs, the poisonous waste will drop there. If the deposit is small, cough, catarrh or cold may be the result. If the deposits are large, asthma and bronchial troubles are caused from the irritation. This shows that not enough waste is passed in the urine voided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If the stomach is the weakest area, the waste settling there may cause catarrh, while large deposits can cause cramps, pains, and ultimately even ulcers. We have noticed that extreme nervousness is due to lack of proper kidney functioning; as soon as this is corrected and the waste removed from the stomach and head all signs of nervousness disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If the deposits settle in the joints, it is usually called arthritis; and if deposited for years, the uric acid crystallizes and forces its way into the bones, causing swelling of the joints and eventually deformity. Rheumatism, neuralgia, neuritis, lumbago, sciatica, gout, gall stones, stitches in the side, varicose veins, skin diseases of all kinds, and affections of the lungs, eyes, ears, nose, teeth and chest are all due to poisoned blood, as are running sores, swellings, boils, headaches, and so on. The only way to rid the body of these so-called ‘diseases’ is to first clean the intestines, kidneys, and bladder, so as to stop the accumulation of uric acid and other systemic waste products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Very often the blood attempts to throw off waste through eczema, herpes, itch, boils, carbuncles, tumors, erysipelas, suppurating abscess, and skin eruptions of all kinds. If we rub salves on these eruptions and succeed in driving the waste in again, we may cause inner inflammation and even death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“What, then, is to be done?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having reached this point, Dr. X could see very clearly what must be done. “The body,” he reasoned, “is a machine running on five cylinders—the skin, the lungs, the heart, the intestines, and the kidneys. First, the skin and the kidneys must be assisted to regain their normal functioning by warm baths, hot poultices, and heating salves applied over the kidneys. Thus the uric acid and other systemic waste can be properly eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The second step, obviously, is to cleanse the intestinal tract; and since it has been found that salts and oils do not remove the filth from the mucous lining of the intestines, herbs and other natural remedies are indicated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point, just as Dr. X was examining his reasoning and finding it good, a man walked into the office. “Doctor,” he inquired, “what would you recommend for hay fever? My wife suffers with it every summer, and we were told that she ought to begin treating it now.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Docs she have many colds?” asked Dr. X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, she does, Doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“How about skin eruptions?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, she has something like eczema.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Your wife is quite a modern woman, I suppose. What kind of underclothing does she wear?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, she wears these silk shorts, you know —scan ties or something like that—and sometimes she wears a silk shirt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. X sighed. “My dear young man, if you really want your wife cured, the first thing you must do is to go out and buy her some nice warm underpants. The only thing wrong with her is that she has congested kidneys, like most of our modern woman, and if she doesn’t be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST24, 1938 </span><span class="font5">gin to cover them properly, sheTl have something worse than hay fever before long.”</span></p>

The inevitable result follows that the sectarian boys and girls pile in and the bus fills up and the last pupils of the public schools have to walk.

<h4><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Bali, the Happy Land</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">In a world of strife and unrest •it is pleasant to read of a land as yet unspoiled by civilization, declared by travelers to be the most interesting spot in the Orient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the harlot of Revelation, now riding the nations, does not seem to have any influence and missionaries are not permitted, at the same time the country suffers from a religion of its own; but this seems to be the only fly in the ointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bali is the name of this country, and it lies in the Sunda islands, latitude 8° 42' S., longitude 115° 19' E. It is a hundred-mile square of tropieal wooded mountains and fertile valleys just east of Java. W riters go into ecstasies when describing this little-known spot, and artists consider the Balinese women to be the most statuesque in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bali is blessed with a gentle climate, fertility and beauty. Gentle living is encouraged, and a simple standard of life is followed. Fortunately isolated from the rest of “civilization”, the Balinese have no political feuds, no economic worries, no fears of war, no competition and no discord. Mechanical inventions have not as yet caused crops to be burnt in order to keep up prices, and there is plenty for everybody. Happiness and contentment are the lot of the people. Bali indeed seems to be the nearest approach to Paradise this poor old earth has to offer at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In his recent book Jftwt, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the Unknown,</span><span class="font5"> Dr. Alexis Carrol has set forth certain standards for a perfect civilization, and according to these standards the Balinese approach the ideal in their ways of living and working, in their diet, tempo and philosophy. They have not been greedy for trade nor aggressive for conquest, but for 2,000 years have been developing their island and people, until today the name Btili has come to be synonymous with Utopia. The Balinese people are probably the most “natural” people in the world. They are outdoor people with clean, golden-brown bodies gleaming with high lights. They wear no tight clothing and walk with a swinging, perfect balance, due to the habit of carrying burdens on their heads. They are straight and supple, slender and graceful. Both men and women dress in a sarong, a strip of cotton about 40 inches wide and nearly three yards long, falling in flowing folds to the ankles. Usually the sarong is hand-dyed in brilliant</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 24, 193B </span><span class="font5">designs of flowers arid birds or Hindu patterns. A few of these garments, the more somber ones for everyday use, and a few simple articles of jewelry, make up a Balinese woman’s wardrobe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are seventy percent more women than men in the island, and the former do most of the work. Just whether this is approaching the ideal depends upon one’s point of view. However, the men are pot lazy and the women do not attempt to dominate the men in authority, although they control the purse-strings and do all the bargaining and business transactions, while the men look after the farms and the irrigation of the land, at which they are expert. The outdoor life has made the women as strong and as hardy as the men, yet they are as straight and slender as saplings, with shapely hands and feet, and are indeed beautiful to look upon. The Montessori system of education seems to have been anticipated in Bali; for children from the age of four and five years are taught to use their hands at some skillful occupation that appeals to them. By instinctive talent they are encouraged to become farmers, wood-carvers, weavers, artists, musicians, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mental diseases and nervous disorders are unknown in Bali, as. the people live at peace with their neighbors and sleep as relaxed as children. Life in the open air and suitable food keep them in good physical health. There are no beggars in Bali; for nobody strives to become exceedingly rich and so accumulate what rightly belongs to another. The love of money as such does not seem to be the root of whatever evil may be found in that fair land, as money is by no means all-imp or taut. Rice is far more important as a means of exchange. If a man has a good wife and family, a home like his neighbor’s, plenty to eat and an untroubled soul, what does he want with money ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the island lies quite near the equator, the average temperature for the year is only 80° Fahrenheit. Gentle breezes sweep the island from all sides, and the soil is so fertile that there are three and sometimes four harvests a year. Rice is the main crop, and coffee comes next. All—-young and old, men and women—share in the work of cultivation. When a crop is ready for harvest a man’s neighbors help him until the crop is safely gathered in. Drought and blighted harvests are unknown. Fruits and flowers of all kinds grow in pro</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fusion, and a visit to the early-morning market in the woods is a sight that one never forgets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peace, beauty and the love of one’s follow men are things which the world will enjoy only when the Kingdom of Jehovah is established in the earth, and the happiness of the people of Bali is nothing to be compared with that which the world of mankind will enjoy in that day when there will really be “peace on earth to men of good will”. So, if you are thinking of going to.Bali to escape the turmoil and trouble that is in the world today, or .the greater trouble which Jies ahead, there’s a far better move you can make. Take your stand on the side of Jehovah, and come under the protection of His “city of refuge”—unless, of course, you have already done so, in which case you’ll not be worrying about going to Bali.—Contributed.</span></p>

I have heard of hunting dogs being imported from England because of their savagery, I have seen little black children dead </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">the grass, so numerous that I thought they were dead sheep. I have seen the whole of the walls of men’s huts covered with the scalps of aborigines.

<p><span class="font5">♦ The champion jumper is believed to ne the tree-climbing kangaroo, found only in northern Queensland, Australia. This creature, three and a half feet long, with a tail often much longer than its body, remains in the treetops in the daytime, but at night feeds on berries, grass tips and wild fruits. It has the usual kangaroo pouch in which to carry its young; One of the most remarkable features about it is its ability to leap eighty or ninety feet to the ground without injury, and then make off like a streak. There is no other animal that can make a leap from such height and survive it uninjured.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ In the House of Lords, at Westminster, London, facing the throne, is a large, red-eovered, ungainly object, on which the Lord Chancellor sits when Parliament is in full session. As its name, &quot;The Woolsack”, implies, it is a~ sack of wool, and should be a reminder to the steeL manufacturers, cotton spinners and financiers of England that the wealth of that country was built up upon the wool of her sheep. The word &quot;staple”, meaning, among otjier things, ‘center of trade/ ‘principal commodity’ and ‘chief material’, was at one time applied exclusively to the wool trade in England. A &quot;stapler”, or grader of wool, was originally also a merchant who either bought his wool in England or sheared his own sheep, and who took the bales of wool with him to the &quot;staple town” for sale to other merchants from all over Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Staple” towns were the centers through which the export wool trade was forced to go, and here the revenue due on wool and fells (skins with wool) was collected. Calais was usually the staple town, and, in the year 1423, was finally established as such. In addition to whol and wool fells, hides, leather and tin passed through the staple, and the bulk of this trade was in the hands of the wool merchants who, in the year 1354, were formed into a corporation under a mayor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wool was made into cloth in Flanders and the Netherlands, but later this manufacture was started in England, and grew so rapidly that the great cloth-making cities in the former countries were finally ruined. The manufacture of cloth finally ousted the wool trade as the chief item of export from England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sheep provide the world with 1,750,000 tons of wool yearly, but they have other uses. In London they are used instead of lawn mowers. Not by everyone, of course 1 In the year 1882 the Office of Works decided to allow sheep to graze in Hyde Park’s 370 acres, and today the grass in other parks too is cropped by sheep, thus saving the cost of mowing, providing the authorities with a small amount of money for pasturage, and giving the farmers some cheap grazing. In other parts of Great Britain, golf courses, football fields, cricket fields and other grounds which would otherwise need mowing, are grazed by sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 24, 1638</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sheep-breeding on scientific lines did not commence in Englarid until nearly two hundred years ago. Some years later, in the year 1794, a man was given a commission and 200 acres of land as an inducement to settle'in Australia. He began to breed sheep where the city of Sydney now stands, and, as his stock grew, searched for better fields and discovered the richest grazing lands in Australia. To some extent wool is today doing for Australia what it did for England hundreds of years ago. Australia, with about 114,000,000 sheep, produces a quarter of the world’s supply of wool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before a fleece can be used it has to be washed to rid it of grease, known as &quot;wool-dirt”. Not long ago this grease was a waste product, stopping up the sewers in the woolmanufacturing towns, and a curse in those countries where water was scarce; but in the year 1890 an English chemist was able to produce from this &quot;dirt” fat, now known as lanolin, which is the nearest thing to human fat known and which has revolutionized the cosmetic industry, which now has an annual turnover of millions of pounds sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rust is said to have been the greatest curse of the so-called “metal age”. In one night thousands of pounds’ worth of stock can be ruined by damp if metal goods are unprotected. Rust can destroy cargoes of machinery, tools, razor blades and other metal articles unless they are protected with a film of grease, and scientists have found that refined &quot;wool-dirt” is the best substance for this purpose. Thousands of gallons of preservatives, with lanolin as the chief ingredient, arc used each year in the protection of metal and metal articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a cruder state this grease is an excellent lubricant and is also used in the manufacture of soap and candles. The fact that rain runs off a sheep’s back led paint manufacturers to examine the waterproof properties of lanolin in connection with their trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mutton forms one of the world’s most important items of food. The British Empire furnishes just over 80 percent of the total supplies, and Great Britain takes 95 percent of the world’s total exports; so it may be said that Britain and sheep are still closely linked together. Thousands of tons of frozen mutton and lamb are exported from New Zealand to England, and the process of freezing is now</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font5">so highly developed that it is difficult to dis* tinguish between good frozen meat and that which is “home-killed”. About thirty years ago meat was frozen and stored in ships, with comparatively little thought, and the process of thawing was carried out with even less care. Today, however, freezing, thawing and proper storage have been brought to a fine art, and good lamb and mutton are within the reach of most working people in Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The intestines of sheep make excellent “casings”, or coverings for sausage, and what is known as “catgut” is frequently “sheepgut”. Quite a considerable industry has been founded on this one portion of the sheep. It is used in surgery and also in the manufacture of tennis and other rackets, as well as for the strings of musical instruments. In one London hospital alone 2,500 lamb intestines are converted each week into a medium for stitching wounds caused by operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sheep’s hoofs are used in the manufacture of nitroglycerine and other explosives. Whether this can be termed useful depends upon the purpose to which the explosives are put.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would hardly seem right to conclude this article without reference to the fact that many of the servants of Jehovah have been connected with sheep. Abel, the first witness for Jehovah on this earth, was a keeper of sheep. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were owners of large flocks. David was a shepherd and foreshadowed the Lamb of God, Christ Jesus, who referred to His disciples as sheep and foretold the coming into existence of another Class of people, “other sheep,” who would also be gathered into the. fold of which he is the Good Shepherd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today we have the privilege of seeing this prophecy in course of fulfillment. All over the world, from Nyasaland to Norway, and the mighty continent of America to the tiny island of St, Helena, people of good will, the &quot;other sheep” to which Jesus referred, are showing their love for Jehovah by taking their stand on His side and telling others of the provision He has made for all who will be obedient to His King, Christ Jesus.—James A. Williams, Lithuania.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Direct from Royal Albert Hall, London, England, to fifty carefully selected auditoriums in great cities in every part of the world, will go addresses oil Saturday, September 10, and Sunday, September 11, which every reader of this magazine should make it his business to hear. There is nothing else as important</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HIS Will be the first time in the history of the world that fifty conventions occur in fifty different cities, yet all under one management and all addressed by direct wire at the same moment, and by the same speaker. Radio will not be used. The service of the loudspeakers at the fifty conventions will be by the incomparable direct wires of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company employed in the transmission of all important international communications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Royal Albert Hall, London, is the largest and finest auditorium in the world’s largest city. The London public address will be from there. The principal speaker will be Judge Rutherford. His principal addresses will begin at 8:00 p.m., London Time, Saturday, September 10, and Sunday, September 11, and each will last .one hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The address on Saturday evening (from the convention in Kingsway Hall, London) will be specially for Jehovah’s witnesses and their consecrated companions, the Jonadabs, the great multitude whose hopes are that they may be carried through Armageddon, and never die. Surely they have no other interest as great as that. The address Sunday will be on the subject “Face the Facts”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is it not high time' that honest people who wish to live should indeed &quot;face the facts”? Of what avail will it be to know the facts when it is too late to profit by them? The time to learn the facts is now. Take your stand on Jehovah’s side now. ‘If Jehovah be God, follow Him; if Baal, follow him. How long halt ye between two opinions?’ This is the decision all must make, and the time to make it is NOW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Greatest of All Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In April Judge Rutherford addressed 25,000 people in Sydney, Australia; in June, more than 10,000 in Seattle, Washington; last fall, 30,000 at Columbus, Ohio; but this convention controlled from the platform at Royal Albert Hall will be the greatest of them all— the greatest in number of auditoriums, the greatest in numbers attending (for it is con-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST24, 1938' </span><span class="font5">fidently anticipated that by this time every reader of this magazine sees what is impending, knows he must make a decision, and realizes the importance of taking his stand for God and His kingdom), and the greatest in importance, because God’s Kingdom that is to fill the whole earth is here and daily growing stronger, and there is no time to lose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twenty-three of the cities selected are .in the United States, so situated that none will have to travel very far to attend. A list of these cities will be appended to this article. Select the one nearest to you, and, by all means, go. Ask the Lord to help you arrange your affairs so that you may do this, and you will be astonished, if you are fully devoted to Him, to see how this will be brought about. Obstacles will arise, but the Lord is greater than them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You will wish to know the time, on Saturday and Sunday, September 10 and 11, when the addresses will begin to come through from the speaker’s platform in London; and so, 8:00 p.m. in London is 3:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Saving Time in the United States, 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 2:00 p.m. Central Daylight Saving Time, 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, Noon Mountain Standard Time, and 11: 00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the past three months this magazine has added more than 100,000 new subscribers to its list. Every one of these, as well as the thousands of regular readers, should make it a point to attend one of these conventions and take in every session. There is one within a few miles of your home. Make the effort to go to it and to attend every session and participate in every activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By attending this convention you will participate in the most unique and tremendous witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name that has ever taken place on the planet, and you will be strengthened and comforted for the work that Jehovah has for you to perform.

<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford always draws good audiences in London. On numerous occasions he has packed out the Royal Albert Hall, and he is sure to do so on Sunday, September 11; for the British people realize that the time wh$n they must decide has finally come. They can no longer go on in the old paths which led millions of their young men to untimely deaths and have made the world even worse than it was in the days of Kaiser Wilhelm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should not need any argument that the forthcoming addresses in London by Judge Rutherford (whose books to the number of nearly 300,000,000 are in circulation in 75 languages) mark a great stride ahead in God’s purposes in the earth. You should not only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'&quot;dr </span><span class="font5">arrange to hear these at the nearest subconvention city, but tell your neighbors and friends about it and get them to go along.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>“The Fresh Air of Freedom”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ ‘’That funny smell in Jersey City is the fresh air of freedom.” So stated Time magazine in commenting on the free-for-all distribute of leaflets in Jersey City after the Supreme Court through its momentous decision in Lovell v. Griffin had loosened the bonds of restraint upon such worthy practice. And it was a strange and peculiar odor in a town that for twenty-two years had been in the grip of a gag law prohibiting distribution of anything printed or written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Labor unions, civil liberty organizations, the C. I. 0., defense league, league of women shoppers, and other organizations grasped the opportunity to .inform all and sundry of'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">their particular gospel.’ The police were nonplussed. “We’re enforcing the Jersey City ordinance,.not the United States Constitution,” was the statement of one burly bluecoat. He and others changed their song, however, when the city’s corporation counsel, after diligent study of the decision, informed Boss Hague that it would be best to comply ' with the Court’s ruling. Therefore, after twenty-two years of subjection to a Fascist ordinance, freedom of the press has come to the prisoners within the gates of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sixty-five of Jehovah’s witnesses in times past have felt the sting of this vicious, illegal law. At this writing they are giving witness to the Kingdom without restraint or interference. For this they are glad, and they likewise rejoice that the victory in their case has brought freedom to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lovell decision, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> readers know’, firmly established the principle that no municipality can rightfully require a permit or license to disseminate information or opinion in printed form. It was tough and bitter medicine for many of the municipal tycoons. They had lordly required fingerprints, photographs and life history from applicants who desired to pass printed informative matter to their fellow men. They had put on the books many ordinances specifically designed to restrict the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. Police and prosecutors were scandalized in their susceptibilities over the audacity of a court restricting their activities. They were pained at the spectacle of liberty, and staggered at the blow to their precious gag laws. Some wailed loudly; some squawked feebly; and some took it on the chin without a quiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is with pleasure and delight that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> reports the prostration of soul of some of the sawdust Caesars thus partaking of this fresh air of freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Supreme Court Overruled by Newcorn </span><span class="font5">♦ “What may be wrong in one state may be right in another. I do not consider this decision binding upon the courts of New Jersey.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That’s the way Prosecutor Newcorn, of Plainfield, New Jersey, placed the Plainfield ordinance above the nation’s high court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J. T. Thomason, city attorney of La Grange, Georgia, likewise adjudicated and decreed that decision had no effect on the La Grange ordinance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Naturally, it would be embarrassing for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 24, 1S38 </span><span class="font5">these gentlemen to admit error. They prosecuted and sent to jail many of Jehovah’s witnesses. It’s just too bad to admit they , were wrong and were parties to illegal prosecution. Face-saving is an old American custom, and these gentlemen of the long robes know how to do it. Nevertheless they are not prosecuting Jehovah’s witnesses as of yore. So let them have their little joke and be comforted thereby.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Hoboken Knows When It’s Licked</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Dreary, dingy, dirty Hoboken, where the judge asks the political boss how much to make the fine, and where honor and honesty are as scarce as dust on the New York harbor, took its medicine without a whimper. Chief McFeely issued a general command to the police force that the ban on distribution of leaflets had been lifted. Although the Statue of Liberty still keeps her posterior toward the town, nevertheless a little of the fresh air of freedom can now be inhaled by its luckless inhabitants. [Relapse in Hoboken, since.]</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Edgewater Dies Hard</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ On or about April 6, 1937, Edgewater, New Jersey, adopted a new ordinance regulating distribution of printed matter. The Bergen </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Record</span><span class="font5"> announced it was aimed at Jehovah’s witnesses. It was full of conditions and whereases, fingerprinting and photograph requirements; and the papal aid society fondly hoped it would put an end to expose of their racket. It was too stringent </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">measure even for New Jersey courts; and that, dear fellow citizens, is bad, very bad. One Nancy Cox was penalised under it for distributing copies of the United States Constitution in front of the city hall, and a justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court thereupon ruled the ordinance unconstitutional. Then along came the decree of the United States Supreme Court sounding its death knell. You would think that would be sufficient to satisfy Edge water officials; but they appear stiffnecked and rebellious. They aren’t going to let the United States Constitution have rule over them without a struggle. Newspapers announced that the city attorney was studying the matter carefully. Some of Jehovah’s witnesses have been taken to the police station and pressure brought to force them to comply with the ordinance, all to no avail. The officials die hard, but in course of time will, no doubt, become reconciled to the benefits of freedom and inhale its ozone with joy and gladness.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Where Is the Garden of Eden?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Biblical information is very precise: “And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thenee it was parted, and became into four heads. . . . And the ■fourth river is Euphrates.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nothing incomprehensible there, so let us start to examine the Euphrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Along its present course the Euphrates shows no evidence of either a past or present junction of four great rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In past ages can the Euphrates have extended farther along its course? The answer is yes, and that is the key to the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Persian Gulf is a basin valley which has been inundated at some past period; and according to geological estimate that inundation has been very recent.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;"><img src="g_E_19380824_files/g_E_19380824-6.png" alt="" style="width:97pt;height:71pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">In the Persian Gulf, from Fao, its western extremity, to Ormuz, on the east, there is no ocean depth, no soundings showing ocean trend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Directly we pass from the Persian Gulf through the straits of Ormuz and into the gulf of Oman we meet true' ocean depths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Undoubtedly the Persian Gulf west of Ormuz was once a basin valley through which the Euphrates flowed on past Fao, onward bordering the Koweit and Hasa territories, on past the northern; coasts of Muscat territories, and so outward to its ocean outlet of Ormuz, which was then the northwestern limit of the Indian ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before the Flood the valley held a Garden of Pleasantness, a river oasis bordered to northward by the Hiddekel and to southward by the Euphrates. Its eastern extremity was the junction of four rivers, three of which are supposed to have been lost, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> of which have now been found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Euphrates flowed onward, eastward past Fao (its present termination), to its river junction, and as it flowed onward from there </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font5">name changed. From the Eden junction onward to Ormuz this river was called the Gihon, “the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gihon compassed or encircled the whole land of Ethiopia, the land of the black Arabs. Do not confuse this Biblical Ethiopia with the more modern Ethiopia which we now call Abyssinia. Ancient Ethiopia is now called the Ilasa and the Muscat territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now we have the approximate latitude of the Garden of Eden. If you wish for more precise information- you must patrol the pearl banks of Bahrein, situated in those localities. Where the pearls are best, where their lights are most exquisite—there you are near to the Garden of Eden. The natives will assure you , that fresh water from the ocean bed gives these pearls their exquisite hues and render them the most valuable jewels of the world’s pearl harvest. They are watered by seepage from the lost river Gihon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the ocean flood, of earthquake and tidal wave origin, inundated the basin valley it swept from the Indian ocean westward, drowning the whole of the Adamite world with the exception of Noah, Shem, Ham, Japheth, and their wives and families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Flood retreated gradually and left the Pison as a subterranean river, whose course is still clearly indicated by the Wadi Dawasir, “which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold . . . there is bdellium and the onyx stone.&quot; The geological location is a very exact one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These three substances are in three distinct geological strata. I have seen the gold of Havilah; in the next stratum I have been shown the “bdellium&quot;, a curious lime marble so beautiful in coloring that it is a semi-precious stone. In the last of the three strata is the onyx stone, both the genuine onyx of modern classification and the Biblical onyx or agate. —C. E. V. Craufurd, British naval </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Quezon Shows Considerable Manhood</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Manuel Quezon, president of the Philippines, sharply criticized a judge who denied a poor widow compensation of $500 for the loss of her husband while engaged in obeying the orders of his employers. Thereupon he was berated as a Mussolini, for ■ attacking the judiciary, but he replied that he is hot and does not wish to be a dictator, but' to keep mum in the face of outrageous injustice is too high a price to pay even for the presidency. Mr, Quezon, by his courageous stand on this matter, has set an example that rulers of other lands might follow without injuring their reputation, if any.</span></p><img src="g_E_19380824_files/g_E_19380824-7.png" alt="" style="width:195pt;height:78pt;">
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>“Tower of Religion”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HE public press of March 2, 1938, publishes an architectural picture of a building to be erected at the World's Fair in New York, and which is to be known as “The Temple of Religion”. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> in reporting the meeting held for the purpose of perfecting the plans for such building, states that the speakers that endorsed'the tower project were clergymen of the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish organizations, and professional politicians; and that commercial men also participated in the conference and in the advancement of the movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The beginning of organized religion was marked by the building of the Tower of Babel in the plain of the land of Shinar. Nimrod had been put forward as the “mighty hunter before [that is, supreme and over and above] the Lord” God. (Genesis 10:8-10) Nimrod became the sole dictator and the object of worship and the religious leader. He was also the leader in politics and the chief one of commerce, and he combined these three elements of religion, polities, and commerce to carry on the first organized kingdom. The tower of religion, or the Tower of Babel, was then erected, and concerning it the Scriptures say: “And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth,”— Genesis 11:4,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">was a tower or monument, built to hold together the people in the support of religion, polities and commerce, and was anti-God and a scheme of salvation substituted for that of God's purpose. That tower was an abomination in the sight of God, and therefore He destroyed it and confused the speech of the people. The Devil has ever since used religion to bind together the elements that haye ruled the peoples of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the tower of religion, Babel, marked the beginning of organized religion, it seems quite appropriate and fitting that the ‘Tower of Religion* to be erected at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">World’s Fair, </span><span class="font5">and in which religionists join,. should mark the end of the Devil religion on earth. Thus the Devil is subtly moving the people at the end of the world, where we now are, to do exactly what he moved the people to do at the beginning of organized religion. The fall of the Tower of Babel fittingly pictures the fall of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief shaker on the occasion above mentioned, as reported by the public press, was Mr. Whalen, a thoroughgoing Catholic, who takes an'active part in “Catholic Action”. It will be noted that he did not mention the name of God or Christ, but magnified religion, and clearly the purpose is to foist religion, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, upon the American people. From his speech the following is quoted: “It is of the greatest importance that the religious spirit in American life should be demonstrated at the fair in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">significant way. A keystone of liberty is freedom of worship, the right of each individual to entertain and practice religious beliefs according to the dictates of his conscience. Since the theme of the fair is building the world of .tomorrow, the proposed temple will be a focus for renewed promotion of such an ideal and a demonstration to all that America is ready to project its religious heritage into its future life.” Mark thus, that the speaker says that America is ready now to project </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font5"> into its </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">future life.</span><span class="font5"> It is clearly to be seen that this movement is a part of “Catholic Action”, to draw all religions into one group, and it is another effort moving forward to make the United States a totalitarian government, ruled under one dictator) and the people regimented and compelled to submit to religious forms in violation of God’s expressed law. It is clearly the purpose of Satan, who backs it up, to cause the people to. take a position that insures their own destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The subtle move, under &quot;the guise of religion, is to bring America into the Fascist camp. Mark the striking similarity of the language concerning the building of the Tower of Babel, and the building of the afore-mentioned ‘Tower of Religion’ at the World’s Fair. The New York press says of this ‘Tower of Religion’: “The plans include a 150-foot tower, symbolic of man’s aspiration for the divine.” The name of God and Christ, however, are studiously avoided. The scripture with reference to the Tower of Babel dis-doses that the builders thereof said: “Let us build ... a tower whose top may reach unto heaven.” (Genesis 11; 4) As the Tower of Babel was an abomination in the sight of God, so likewise the ‘Tower of Religion’ that is about to be erected is clearly an abomination in the sight of God. The fate that befell Babel is certain also to befall the religionists and their monument. Let the thoughtful people be warned, take notice, and hold themselves aloof from anything that is an abomination in the sight of God.' Those who would have the blessing of Jehovah God and His kingdom must keep themselves separate from religious schemes and stand firmly and unequivocally on the side of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, who is the rightful Ruler of the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In its desperate poverty, with tens of thousands of its citizens wounded by bombs from the skies, the Chinese people deserve the pity of all mankind. Here are 500 men in a hospital; they have but three physicians to care for them. Almost every one of the 500 has a bullet or shrapnel wound somewhere. Some have to wait three months before they can receive adequate attention. The wounded often die on the way to the hospital. Many of them are women and children. The simple&quot; gauze and dressings needed for care of wounds is inadequate. It is a great problem to get enough food to keep the patients alive, to say nothing of enabling them to get well. In another, a medical hospital, were 381 patients with pneumonia, cholera and typhoid, with only five doctors and eighteen nurses. Most of the patients have to care for themselves. If things like this would not make one hate the Devil, what would? &quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The hope of our youth is being dashed to pieces. Their faith and belief in the principles of justice and righteousness are greatly disillusioned when they find that not only the dictatorships and military countries are ready to do whatever they want in order to satisfy their personal and national ambitions but the peace-loving countries and great democracies of the world are also willing to see the peace and order of the world crumbling under their very eyes without doing anything to stop the tide which, if allowed to develop its course, will spell disaster for the whole world.—-Dr. C.

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Royal Financiers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Many people are under the impression that kings are national figureheads drawing a salary from the state in order to enable them to meet the expenses of a ceremonial life. As a matter of fact, kings are frequently independently wealthy, either as a result of business investments or through inheriting valu</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">able </span><span class="font5">land properties. Such investments at times affect the history of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ex-King Alfonso, of Spain, had an interest in oil shares, among other things, and this led him into conflict with Primo de Rivera and contributed largely to the latter’s downfall. He, in turn, was responsible for Alfonso’s losing the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rumor cannot be depended upon, but if in this case it is correct Queen Wilhelmina, of Holland, is one of the largest shareholders in the Dutch Oil and Rubber Company, trading in the Orient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of these royal investors had a good start, but one of them, the late King Alexander of Yugoslavia, started with almost nothing and, by his own enterprise, amassed a huge fortune, estimated at $20,000,000. His parliament, probably yielding to pressure, voted him a civil list of $1,200,000 a year, one of the largest in Europe. Patriotically (?) Alexander invested the unspent balance of this huge sum in the flourishing grape and wine business of Yugoslavia. Most of the owners of places where wine is sold found it tactful to stock wine from the king’s firms. In cement, machinery and timber lands Alexander was also a true patriot—with dividends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On his accession to the throne, Alexander owned one Daimler. At the time of his assassination he owned 25 Packards, some of them bullet-proof, which did not help much after all, as they were left at home when he went to Marseilles, in 1934, to meet his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bad boy of the Balkans, Carol, of Rumania, learned to live frugally during his exile in France, and it is said that he continues to live that way, general opinion to the contrary notwithstanding. Kings possess financial information which enables them to invest with almost a certainty of success, and it is said that, using </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font5">information, Carol saves $100,000 of his $375,000 eivil list for this purpose. In this way he has a neat little $1,000,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUSTS*, W38 </span><span class="font5">put away in case another rainy day comes his way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After this information, everyone will be ready to sympathize with poor Boris, of Bulgaria, who, aided by a careful wife, scrapes along on $120,000 a year. Half of this represents his eivil list; the other half, his wife’s dowry. The queen of Bulgaria was formerly Princess Giovanna of Italy. One result of this poverty is that diplomatic functions are not frequent in Sofia. Champagne is not a daily beverage at the royal palace, and Boris uses the fact of his poverty to shine as a sparing monarch, whose chief pleasures lie in looking after Eis rose gardens, piloting locomotives and pushing the baby prince around the palace gardens in a perambulator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now that you have dried your tears, prepare to sob out your heart for Zog, of Albania, who gets a paltry $20,000 per annum. Now take a look at the size of Albania, and your tears will cease to flow. Zog is said to have $1,500,000 tucked away safely in Swiss stocks and bonds. Now you can smile I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Edward VIII, now duke of Windsor, was reputed to be the richest of them all. The following figures seem to be in confirmation of this. His civil list amounted to more than the fortune of Carol, Boris or Zog, being in the region of $2,000,000 a year. As he had no children, the Duchy of Cornwall estates, perquisites of the prince of Wales, brought him in another $250,000 to $400,000 annually, so that, officially, Edward was able to struggle along on about $2,500,000 a year. In addition to this, he had a nice private fortune. It is said that, of the $9,000,000 left by Queen Victoria, some part went to Edward, and that from his grandmother Alexandra he inherited another £1,000,000, so that, even after the heavy expenses of Buckingham Palace and the other numerous royal establishments were paid, Edward was able to manage quite nicely, thank you! He had, therefore, little need to invest, and was able to carry on in the wake of his grandfather, Edward VII, spending money right and left. His father, George V, when </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">young man of 25, spent most of his evenings at home with his wife, it is said. At the same age Edward was dashing around the town, visiting the night clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His decision to abdicate meant a loss of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">about $2,000,000 a year; but it must be remembered that practically all of this went to the upkeep of the royal palaces and other royal expenses. So, with about $300,000 a year from his private fortune and $125,000 a year which, it is stated, he will receive from the present king’s civil list, the duke of Windsor will not be too hard up. He will, at any rate, be able to hold his own with the other royal exiles. —Contributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font5">F FOUR officially listed ex-nuns living in the United States, the youngest, Sister Mary Ethel, seven years a nun in Manchester, England, Marseilles, France, and Mandalay, Burtna, is peculiarly fitted to write the book bearing the above title.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Earth’s Greatest Racket</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is nothing humanity so much craves as the present and everlasting enjoyment of life with its attendant and promised blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What would you think of a racket which assumes to control the blessings of the present and the hereafter, which claims the right to engage in any business and that without payment of taxes, to employ slave labor and to draft into its ranks the finest specimens of manhood and womanhood that it can reach; which demands possession of the property of the slaves and the right to employ their bodies sixteen hours a day without compensation; which claims the right to ship these slaves to any part of the world; to change their names at will; to intercept, censor and destroy their mail; to place these slaves behind bars; to deny them the privilege of talking one to another except at specified times and in the presence of a “superior”; and to deny their enjoyment of the simple, natural blessings of family life for themselves and to teach them to hate their own parents and brothers and sisters ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Greatest Dishonor to God</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest dishonor to God that has ever existed on earth is the system operating from Vatican City, which does not even hesitate to make the priests of that system superior to the great God himself! Sister Mary Ethel quotes, at page 85, from the great Roman Catholic theologian, Liguori, the following words addressed to those who have been induced to become slaves to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If, then, you receive a command from one who holds the place of God you should observe it with the same diligence as if it came from God Himself. By some masters of the religious life, the priest and the superior are placed higher than God. Blessed Egidius used to say that it is more meritorious to obey man for the love of God than to obey God Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sister Mary Ethel did not say what it was</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[•Boise Valley Pub. Co., Middleton, Idaho, $I,J </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 24,1938 </span><span class="font5">that led her to surrender her position as a voluntary slave of the Hierarchy, but one catches a glimpse of what may have occurred from the following, taken from page 113 of her little book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through a chink in the blinders which the church, had put on me, I soon discovered that the scabby followers of Siva, Vishnu and Brahma, on the banks of the sacred Ganges, had a priority claim on holy water, holy smoke, holy ashes, holy sheep, holy cattle, ticks, and all; charms, bones, bells and pictures, blessed by arrogant, atheistic priests in both eases, in whom the space usually reserved for morality was unoccupied. Here, too, long before there was a pope in Rome, Purgatory was paying big dividends.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Money the Big Objective &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another thing that opened Sister Mary Ethel's eyes to the fact that the Roman Catholic system is merely a money-making racket is the care that is taken to acquire for ths “church” not only the minds and bodies of its slaves, but everything in the way of property that they may have or that can be obtained on their behalf. The following paragraphs illustrate this point. They are written in the breezy language of the West: ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The truth is girls are recruited for the convents and nunneries because the Church of Rome must have an unlimited number of pauper laborers to insure a fair return on the billions of dollars which she has invested in “Charitable” institutions, such as schools, hospitals, orphanages, and laundries. [Page 18]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The convent is a good place for a girl with </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font4">martyr complex. She will have plenty of opportunity to gratify her sadistic tendencies, from stepping out on a cold stone floor at four or five on a winter morning, to having to eat fat meat, even if she throws it up. Soon, these brave souls would gladly lie down and die, but they will find they cannot do so. It is against the rule. Rome is not looking for martyrs. One nun on the hoof is worth a thousand on the calendar. [P. 56]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Boys and girls of tender years are today being recruited all over the world by the papal press gangs in the confessionals and parochial schools. Only the mentally and physically superior are taken. After an intensive course of training in novitiates these once devoted sons and daughters are taught to abhor their parents. Father and mother, brother and sister are now looked upon as their deadliest enemies. Hate has taken the place of love. [P. 41]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Picture, if jou can, a hand of toddlers, some still in diapers, wearing the outlandish robes.of monks and nuns and living in convents and monasteries, whose “Chastity” was vowed to God before'they knew they had any sex. The mind and heart revolts against the parents who could thus abandon mere babes to the care of half human fanatics, who, by swearing stability on their behalf, sold them into a bondage worse than death. [P. 63]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Interesting Paragraphs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Parents be damned is the attitude </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font4"> of the church of Rome when there is a fL </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fi</span><span class="font4"> chance of getting another slave for the W treadmill. The priest in the eonfessiqn-al has duly impressed on the mind of the girl the fact that she does not have to pay any attention to her parents in the question. If they object, all she has to do is sneak off without saying anything. The parents are on the spot. [P. 65]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beginning, when a girl starts to go to confession, which is usually about seven years of age, the priest suggests, pleads, urges, louder and louder, till after a few years a girl becomes convinced that she is being called by God, and must make a choice. Can she refuse to become a bride of the Lord? Turn God down! She does not want to go into a convent, but she feels ashamed to tell the priest so. She is between the Devil and the deep blue sea. Wearied by the constant harpings of the religious recruiting officer, the “chosen one” realizes that thert: is no way to get around it and yields. The divine hunter has hounded her into a convent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[P. 21] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A girl may tell a priest that she has a “natural repugnance” for the convent life, but that will not make any difference. As long as Catholic hospitals need unpaid nurses, and Catholic schools need unpaid teachers, and Catholic laundries need unpaid washerwomen, and as long as Beggars are needed to panhandle for the church, so long will the Divine Hunter seek free help, and peddle Vocations instead of handing out pay cheeks to those “forgotten women” who do her work. [P. 26]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Love of Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">a</span><span class="font4"> When a girl enters a convent she is forbidden to dispose of her property or in any way encumber it. Sixty days before her solemn profession she is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">forced to renounce her property.</span><span class="font4"> This is a legal renunciation, a binding document. The object of this is to prevent, as has been explained, legal heirs from taking it from the church, to which, in a majority of eases, it is renounced. [P. 39]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nuns, or cloistered sisters, are financed by the sum of money which each girl must bring to the institution of her choice. The sum is specified by the church, not by the candidate. This money must be paid before the girl takes the veil, not after, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">unless payment is guaranteed in a manner which will enable the church to collect legally. This money must be safely and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">profitably</span><span class="font4"> invested. If a girl decides to leave, the interest on her money, which the church had safely and profitably invested, stays with the convent. In the case of a very wealthy girl the interest would amount to a tidy sum. This i$ velvet to the church. [P. 39]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each novice is told to write to her parents or closest relative and ask them to send her a sum of money to purchase a fitting layout in which to be married to the Lord of Lords. The poorest of parents fall for this one. Beg, borrow or steal, the money, if it can possibly be raised, is sent to the girl. It goes where all other money goes, into the bank to swell the bulging coffers of the papacy. Does the girl get a new bridal outfit? Certainly not. The robes in use for the ceremony last years and years. When they do wear out, some rich Catholic is worked to replace them with fine ones. The holy racket goes merrily on. [P. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">77]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All the money, furniture, clothes, and whatever species of property you. possess, all that you receive from your parents or relatives, or the fruits of your industry, belong, not to you, but to the convent. You have only the use of what the superior gives you. Hence, if you dispose of anything without her leave, you are guilty of theft, by violating the vow of poverty.”—Liguori’s True Spouse of Christ, p. 159. [P. 78] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48 to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the Sex Feature</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of Sister Mary Ethel does not overemphasize the gross and revolting features set forth by Maria Monk, but there is enough in the following paragraphs to amply satisfy the curious in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Poor nuns! I pity you far more than the wives of the gods in the temples of India, who are the object of constant solicitude by hordes of missionaries. Their unfortunate lot is open for all the world to see. Over the fives of the phantom Brides of Christ, the church of the popes has carefully drawn a screen of fake sanctity and phoney mystery, lest an aroused public demand a square deal for the Forgotten Women, in the harems of the pope. [P. 88]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When a Hindoo priest seduces a girl he puts her into a temple as the wife of the god. When a Catholic priest seduces a girl he puts her into a convent and marries her off as a wife of god, a “spouse of Christ”. In neither case does the priest cease his depredations. There’s always room for one more victim. The doctor hides his mistakes with a spade and shovel; the priest, with a simple black veil. Do I mean that all the nuns and sisters are in convents because they were seduced by priests? Certainly not. I do mean, however, that when a priest seduces a girl, a thing which happens quite often, he is at liberty to put his victim into</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font4">a convent. A priest cannot under'any circumstances marry a girl, but be can do better than marry her himself—he can give her to Jesus Christ as a spouse, for a “sinful life in the past is no impediment to a vocation'<sup>1</sup>. [P. 116]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One day some of my pupils were discussing who had been the longest in the convent. One bragged that she had been in the convent since she was two years old; another had been there since she was a year, and so on. At last, the superior Mother Marie’s pet chimed in and told the world that she had been in the convent longer than any of them ■—she had been born there! [P. 64]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom to Leave</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic church advertises that any nun may leave at any time she pleases. On this point Sister Mary Ethel says illumi-natingly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a girl is not free to write to her parents without having her mail censored; if she is not free to use her own name; if she is not free to speak to her so-called sisters, only at stated times, and then under’ close supervision; if she is not free to leave the dormitory without the permission of the trusty on duty; if she is not free to make any friends in the convent; is she free to leave the conventf [P.98]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I sicken when I recall the day, years ago, when a new girl stood up and informed our Mistress of Novices, Mother Xavier, that she would not take out one word that she had written to her parents, and that in addition she intended to return to her home on the next boat. After all, she was only doing what she had been assured she could do any time she felt like it. I can still see the leering face of the Mistress of Novices, The Mother Superior had the girl’s money, her trunk was locked up and the Mistress, Mother Xavier, had the key. The girl was not free in' a supposedly free convent to go into her own trunk, and the rags she was wearing were not hers, but the property of the Community. By what authority does the church of Rome tamper with the mail? No authority, save that of the pope, who claims to be a law unto himself. [P. 95]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before a professed sister, or -nun, that is, one who has taken the three vows and the black veil which go with them, and is an index of her marriage to Jesus Christ, can leave a convent, she must first obtain an “indult of secularization”, a permit from the pope to return to secular life. [P. 106]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a girl is released after months, perhaps years of waiting, she is given the clothes she brought with her, which, after being locked in a storage room, stink to high heaven, not with the odor of sanctity, but the reek of mildew. Without being permitted to say farewell to her erstwhile “sisters”, she is dumped into the convent carriage and hauled by a circuitous route, to the boat or depot. She is a deserter from the ranks of God’s soldiers, a child of the Devil. [P. 105]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Only Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Awuinmijjiw^j </span><span class="font5">Smarting under the injustices to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font5">which she was subjected when a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I I </span><span class="font5">nun, Sister Mary Ethel proposes certain corrections of the system. She would make it illegal for any monastery to accept boys or any convent to accept girls before they are eighteen years of age. She would not permit either boys or girls to make the vows before they are twenty-one. There should be always on hand, and reported from time to time, statements of the exact number in each institution, with certified lists of the real names of the inmates and the names and addresses of their parents. She would have those who have thus renounced their citizenship deba’rred from voting. They should be fingerprinted (if brought into the country from foreign lands) ; they should be required to make wills and file and probate the same. They should be forbidden to wear religious regalia except on their own premises. They should be visited regularly by boards of health, and their death certificates signed by both Catholic and non-Catholic doctors—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Institutions that prey on the public for support should be under public supervision. Unpaid labor, whether it be convent or convict, should not be allowed to enter into unfair competition with paid labor. Panhandling, whether by bums in robes, or bums in rags, should be prohibited. [ P. 31]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While one may appreciate Sister Mary Ethel’s good desires, yet God’s way is the onlyway, that is, the complete destruction of the entire system which permits of such atrocities as are disclosed in her little book. Nothing can cure the Devil’s civilization, and least of all can the center of that civilization, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy racket, be made anything more than a vessel fitted for destruction. The book is very interesting and every point is well documented by reference to standard Catholic works. It is worth more than its price to anybody in danger of being ensnared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> would be interested in any one of a dozen endorsements of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Forgotten Women</span><span class="font5"> by newspapers, writers, judges, former priests and others, but will especially appreciate the fact that this “calm, candid and critical examination of the conventual institution on the basis of experience and a study of Roman Catholic authorities and canon law” was so much appreciated by Judge Rutherford that he wrote to the author direct, expressing-his appreciation of her work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Wholesale Arrests in Hamburg</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From itpril 1 to 13, 1938, according to information recently obtained, suit was brought at the Hanseatic Special Court against 39 members of the International Bible Students, charged with high treason. These are the first of a total of about 200 persons to be tried on the same charges.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The accused were charged with maintaining during the years 1934 to 1937 inclusive the forbidden organization of Jehovah’s witnesses, dissolved in the whole of Germany in 1933, and of having produced, distributed and purchased publications forbidden in Germany. In spite of the fact that as early as 1933 great numbers of members of that organization were imprisoned and thrown into concentration camps, and in spite of the fact that prosecutions have continued since then without cessation, the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in Hain-burg, especially since</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the fall of 1936, has been very noticeable. In all quarters of the city books and pamphlets were spread in great numbers, as well as countless copies of the magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dar Wacht-turm.</span><span class="font5"> The accused are charged with having effected a complete, perfect, well-functioning, extensive and active organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the argument in court it was declared that these people are not to be considered harmless religious fanatics, but dangerous enemies of the State. Their attitude of hostility to the state is seen, above all, from the fact that they unanimously decline to defend their native country, weapon in hand, decline to do any work whatever in the armament industry, and call the authorities of the government Satan’s representatives, and refuse their support to every organisation of the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief sentences thus far imposed are on Max Crete, 56 years of age, imprisonment for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font5"> years; II. Fritz, 47, for 34 years; F. Hell, 44, for 3 years; W. Hej, 31, for 3 years; Dora Golly, 50, for years; O. Jahnke, 44, for 2J years; W. Lehmbecher, 34, for 24 years. The rest were sentenced to imprisonment varying from two years down to three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the fact that 99.08 percent of the German people voted for Hitler and his policies, it is incredible that such a r el ati vc 1 y insignificant God-serving organization as are the Bible Students should have brought together hundreds into their forbidden organization and have succeeded in spreading countless magazines and booklets in all parts of the city and surroundings.-Translation from the Swedish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Social-Demokrat-</span><span class="font5">e?i, Stockholm, Sweden,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font5"> explains that most of Germany’s so-called “political prisoners” are Jehovah’s witnesses; nobody may help their relatives; after release from prison they are always sent to concentration camps, women as well as men, and may never regain their freedom. Every prisoner would rather serve a long term in prison than a short one in a concentration camp. The armies of Gog are on the march.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Francisco Franco, Generalissimo, how do you sleep of nights? Possibly you are not sensitive to sounds. But a scream can be distracting. Even a moan may murder sleep. To some there is a nightmare quality in the curious rhythm made by the feet of hundreds running for their lives. And the cry of a child in anguish seems poignant to many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' And so, Francisco Franco, your lot is not a happy one. You must live on until the day of your death with this savage symphony ringing in your cars. Even a generalissimo may discover that it is impossible to stay the thing he has beg u n. Bombs loosed in the night may set up a succession of waves as pebbles tossed into a pond.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">German Planes from Majorca</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The service to the Papal cause by the German aviation ■wing quartered in Pollensa bay, Majorca, is very effective. It is only 100 miles from Majorca to the Spanish coast, and it is possible for the high-powered Junkers planes to make a round trip and murder a good many people and be back at their base in less than two hours. On a recent trip four of them dropped a hundred bombs on the city of Castellon, destroying the provincial clinic and hospital, including the children’s and mental sections. This murder of children and of the insane by the Papa l-“blessed” planes of Herr Hitler has the approval of the Devil because it helps to dishonor the name of Jehovah God, in whose name it is done.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>What Franco Stands For</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ “All of Spain’s troubles originate from the stupid idea of the government in teaching Spaniards generally to read. To teach any man to read is nothing less than putting him in a condition to assimilate poisons which will make the country miserable,” says Marquis of Lozoya, in Franco's paper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Correo de Espano, </span><span class="font5">of Bilbao, Spain. Such is the idea of the Hierarchy and those in sympathy with its depredations. Never give the suckers a break. Don’t let in a ray of light. Keep them ignorant and under control.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>Mitchell Palmer’s “Patriotism”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Few people of today know anything about Mitehell Palmer, the 'hit-air balloon of Woodrow Wilson’s declining days, who aimed to make a great name for himself by having every other American designated a “Red” and deported somewhere. He is dead; so this is merely kicking his ideas. His patriotism was of the same general tenor as that of William Randolph Hearst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For years as a result of Palmer’s activities even Federal judges seemed tied, and though the Communist party could and did have presidential candidates in the United States in 1932 and 1936, and a legal place on the ticket, yet the judges held, in eases before them, that membership in the party is sufficient cause for deportation of anybody who could be deported. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now Judge Jos. C. Hutcheson, Jr., of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, has reversed the whole silly procedure, protesting against such Pecksniffian righteousness, hypocrisy and party bigotry, and thinks the cause of liberalism more retarded than advanced by intelligence and activities of such “patriots”, and the International Juridical Association calls for the repeal of the silly laws of which Palmer was the inspiration.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>The Receivership Racket</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Referring to the receivership fees for the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company’s two experiences in that line, which experiences set the stockholders back some $7,000,000 and boosted the incomes of judges and attorneys by similar amounts, United States Senator Harry S. Truman, of Missouri, charged before the Senate that some of the supposedly most reputable judges and lawyers in the United States had in these transactions—</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The greater the importance of safeguarding the community from .incitements to the overthrow of our institutions by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional right of free speech, free press and free assembly, in order to maintain the opportunity for free . political discussion, to the end that government may be responsible to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means.

<p><span class="font5">♦ Contracts for closed shops are unlawful and unenforceable, according to a United States Supreme Court decision handed down in 1892. The decision read:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Whatever enthusiasts may hope for, in this country every owner of property may work it as he will, by whom he pleases at such wages and upon such terms as he can make; and every laborer may work or not, as he sees fit, for whom, at such wages as he pleases; and neither can dictate to the other how he shall use his own, whether property, time or skill.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Americans must learn to “stick ’em up”. The way Ed Lambert, Bothell, Washington, puts it:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">I would like to respectfully suggest to our Senate and House that a law be enacted ordering all citizens and residents, over -5 years of age, to salute whenever a government official or dignitary comes in view, the salute to be given in this fashion: Both hands raised high above the head.

<h3><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>By Trail and Stream and Garden Path—Garden Visit at Dusk</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">L</span><span class="font5">ONG shadows trailed across the soft, green grass. The windows of the houses glowed with the red rays of the setting sun. A gentle sweetness fell over the garden, A few butterflies flitted aimlessly about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;'Jane, look up there I” said Sally. “See that yellowish-brown butterfly with the silver spots on its underwings?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“All the fellows know that butterfly. It’s a Spangler, isn’t it, Jane?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, Buddy, it’s a Spangler, or a Fritil-lary.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, but he didn’t know the big word,” said a little voice behind them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And you didn’t even know the other word.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Bet you don’t know that one,” Bunny chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Which one does she mean ?” Sally inquired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“That bright orange fellow edged and flecked with deep brown. Did you notice the rapid, jerky flight? There he is again, on the side of the garage. Try to catch him, Buddy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Aw, you were too slow,” exulted Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, he’s completely disappeared. But how could he possibly hide that brilliant coloring so well? Very simply, we shall find. If you look carefully, Sall}’, you will find him almost at your feet, but looking entirely different. Have you found him ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Nooo—Yes! Here he is; but the orange is hidden because his wings are closed up tight together above bis body.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“That’s right. The underwings are woodcolored and can scarcely be seen, against ground or tree; an easy way of hiding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Suddenly Bunny giggled. “Look at the bumps moving,” she said, pointing toward the garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jane looked and she, too, saw “bumps” moving. Going a little closer she called back, “Come here, all of you. Now, look along the path between the beans and the cabbage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I don’t see—” began Sally, then screamed. y-jSBk “A snake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Come back here,” called Jane. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">f J.</span><span class="font5"> S? “There’s no danger. Besides, it’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ffllJCiy</span><span class="font5"> not <sup>a</sup> snake—it’s two snakes.&quot; r ' w I \ Slowly Sally returned. “Keep quiet and watch,” said Jane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On came the snakes, one right behind the other. They were large black snakes, really beautiful, both of them. Straight along the path they came, passing within three feet of Jane. A moment later they had disappeared into the grass beyond the garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bunny’s little eyes sparkled and she clapped her hands softly. “Snakes!” she murmured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Pretty big ones,” Buddy announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jane, show Sally our milk snakes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sub>t</sub> “More snakes?” gasped Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘“Yes, indeed. I found the nest before the eggs had hatched. We have a whole family, now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But aren’t you going to kill them? Someone might get bit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Milk snakes are just as harmless as black snakes, and even more useful. We feel very fortunate in having a family of them to guard our garden from pests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I like green ones,” declared Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I’ll get you one,” said Buddy, generously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Off he went, and soon returned holding a beautiful green snake, a little over a foot long. Bunny held out her hands and Buddy put the snake into them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It feels funny,” she giggled. “But it won’t hurt. It eats bugs, Jane said.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“That’s right,” answered Jane. &quot;So it is another friend. In the stream out at the hollow are some water snakes. We often see them. Although they are not so useful as our garden -snakes, still they.are not harmful and should not be killed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But aren’t you afraid the children will get bit by a poisonous snake?” asked Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They have been taught never to go near a snake they are not familiar with. There aren’t many poisonous snakes around here. The water moccasin, a very dangerous snake, is not so common anymore. There are none in the streams near here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“How about copperheads?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There are a few. But the children know them by sight. Their copper color plainly marks them. The copperhead seldom ‘picks a fight’; so that lessens its danger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Rattlesnakes!” said Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Not many, though. And rattlers generally do not strike unless bothered. Of course, it is wise to be careful and not to fool with poisonous snakes. But that is no reason for fearing and killing all snakes. Most of them are gentle and helpful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It got away,” cried Bunny, suddenly, as she watched a streak of green disappear under a stone.—Contributed.</span></p><img src="g_E_19380824_files/g_E_19380824-13.png" alt="" style="width:63pt;height:72pt;">

<p><span class="font5">„ ......<sub>..</sub> ,THE four-hundredth anniversary</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fh-—y—JI of the proclamation of 1538 of the 11 1__1 | king’s order in council that a copy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">th<sup>6</sup> l<sup>ar</sup>hi<sup>est</sup> size should be placed in. the parish churches throughout all England has given the religionists a great chance to talk. They have made full use of the chance. But judging by that which lias been reported of their sayings; the parsons and clergy of all the churches have not risen higher than to talk about the intellectual advantages and the moral and religious gain which would follow constant and regular reading of the Bible. It seems that very little has been said about the study of the Bible, and certainly nothing is reported as having been an expression of an urge to study the Word of God that the will of God might be known. But that could hardly be expected of the parsons and the ministers; for to set their &quot;flocks studying the Bible that they might know the will of God would.be to admit that they themselves have not known what they have been talking about. Studying the Bible and expounding it is a preserve they have kept to themselves, and hope still to keep; but the flocks are not so docile as once they were: they have begun to doubt their shepherds’ ■knowledge of the things they profess to understand, and, what is more serious for the shepherds, their sincerity is in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However superficial the knowledge of the average, church member about the Bible and his sect’s interpretation of it, he knows enough to be able to judge the value of religion as it is represented by the parsons. Even the casual reading of the daily newspapers is sufficient to disclose the impotence of religion, and that its claims to attention are hypocritical. It has no message for the people, and is helplessly dragging along. Dogmas, and forms of worship and religious ceremonies, are of little account to the average man, and he knows that when he is urged by the parsons to read his Bible there is a certain amount of humbug in the advice: he knows that the clergy arc more concerned with the maintaining of their church systems than with his own particular good. The clergy have worked for their own downfall. Except for one here or there they will not admit that the Bible is the Word of God: they admit, as they must, or discard it altogether, that it contains the word of God. But they are divided amongst themselves as to what words are to be so accepted. They are blind leaders of the blind. The church of Rome is, of course, keeping itself apart from these anniversary celebrations. From his high place in Rome the pope watches and waits; he knows well that Protestantism and its worship and use of the Bible as a fetish are passing away.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>Fat in the Fire</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">• Reverend (!) Hugh Menzies, of Dysart barony church, Fife, has spilled some religious fat into the fire. In a public advertisement of his church services he has announced that his services as a parson, and those of his helpers/ are no longer at disposal except to those who attend his church regularly or contribute to its upkeep. The members on the communion roll of the church increase, but not of those who support the church, and the parson is tired of the deadwood members. He hopes, he says, that neighboring churches will not give a welcome to his castoff members, who have been making a convenience of his church. The reverend gentleman has probably started a fire that will burn out his own kitchen; it will surely call outsiders’ attention to the hollowness and the humbug of “church-life”. If the pretense of church membership were dealt ■with in this way by all the church systems there would be a notable slump in religion for the newspapers to report, ’the various sects report their figures annually, and they show big; but if only those who are active supporters of the churches were counted, the figures would be less by two-thirds, or even more. Such reports will not be given, for the impoverished condition of the religious institutions and of religion itself would be exposed to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">; But what of the smaller numbers of attendees at Mt. Mercies’ church ? How do they stand in relation to the Christianity of Jesus? And, how does the reverend parson himself stand thereto? As to membership in his church, and the church roll, these count for nothing in the sight of God, and of Christ, the Head of the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">■ • ... . ■ . ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">church of God; neither does attendance at a church .affect the standing of the disciple of Jesus. The dogmas of the church system which Mr. Menzies supports are in direct variance . with the Scriptures; his ehureh system is a human institution, and does not even stand on ' the same foundation as that of the scribes and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pharisees, which Jesus denounced and which God destroyed. To the woman of Samaria, who, with those of her kindred, put their trust in worshiping in the right place, and according to right formulas, disputing with the Jews as to the proper place to worship God, Jesus said, “Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. , , . - the hour coincth, and now is, when [ye] . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.” (John 4:21-23) The early church followed these words of Jesus, and the apostles who guided the disciples, under the direction of the holy spirit, gave no indication whatever that special buildings were to be erected, or dedicated and consecrated to the worship of God. Nob is there any authority for a pries t-hood such as is claimed by the ministry represented by Mr. Menzies; that also is a manmade institution. False teachers led many of , the first believers astray, and, under the in-_ &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">_</span><span class="font5"> stigation of the Devil, there began that system</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Political Situation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• The rapprochement between Mr. Chamberlain and Mussolini appears to have had an<sup>1 </sup>irritating effect upon Hitler and his friends. There seems little doubt that the continual</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">s AUGUST 34, *938</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">aerial bombardment of British ships in Spanish ports is being done at the instigation of the Germans. It is suggested that it is being done partly in order to detract attention from Hitler’s plans in Czechoslovakia, and partly to interfere with the English-Italian agreement, which (joes not come into operation until the war in Spain is concluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The unsettled state of European politics and their relation to Britain is causing increased concern in Britain. The general political situation is greatly affected. It seems probable that before this Parliament is dissolved there will be some approachment by the present government to the Labor party and to the leaders of Trade Unionism, to include both Trade Union members and the foremost members of the Labor party in the cabinet, thus forming a national government something like that which obtained under the leaderships of Ramsay MacDonald. It is certain that if there were again an election in the near future the Labor party would lose rather than gain: they are not strong enough in numbers nor in enthusiasm to enable them to get a majority of seats in Parliament and so take control of the country’s government. But no government could carry on in wartime without the willing aid of that party. At present there is scant outward indication towards Fascism, sb desired by some in high places in politics; but the move is in that direction and there see'ins little doubt that ultimately the world’s troubles will drive Britain into such a government as amounts to Fascist control. ’ ‘</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>Franco’s Friends</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">• Cardinal Goma y Tomas, who is head of the Spanish Hierarchy, is an intimate friend of General Franco’s, and is said to be his counselor. On his way back from the Eucharistic Congress at Budapest he has been giving interviews with foreign newspapers. He said, of Franco, “Franco has proved himself to be one of the ablest soldiers in Europe and could prove himself a leading European statesman. However, I quote no predictions on that score, except to express my complete confidence in the general’s just and Christian outlook.” lie said that he could not seo in Franco either a miniature Fuehrer or a Duce. He acknowledges that the assistance of Fascist forces have been instrumental in Franco’s successes, but said that that would be repaid by commercial concessions; he added, however, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nazi propaganda would not be tolerated. He made no such reservation against Fascism, perhaps because the pope is on good terms with Mussolini, while at present he is ostensibly somewhat at variance with Hitler. It seems evident that Franco is but an agent in this matter of the. Spanish rebellion. The two dictators care, nothing for Franco’s reputation as a Christian gentleman, and if the German and Italian commanders will insist on intensified bombing activities, their main instrument in the. war, and the only way of attaining their victory, when Franco’s rebellion has won its way through to victory unquestionably the two dictators will take what they want out of that victory; but it does not seem that either one or the other will get the, predominance; the Papacy will reap the chief benefit. The cardinal claims that the Papal encyclicals on social justice are being rapidly applied in Franco’s territory, adding, however, that as yet they have barely done more than scratch the surface in their efforts to help the workers and farmers; that a tremendous amount yet remains to be done. A commentator adds, “He did not say why the Church had allowed the ground to remain unscratched during the thousand years of clerical control of Spain.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>A Cleric Speaks Out</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">• The dean of Canterbury, Reverend Hewlett Johnson, has not been afraid to raise his voice against the injustice which he believes has been done to the republican government of Spain by the lies which have been circulated so freely about its “persecution of the Catholics”. In this he acts differently from the majority of those in places of power in the Church of England. Lately it has been said that the republican government in Spain has “liquidated” the Roman Catholic clergy in Spain. That is denied : the dean says there are at present 2,000 Catholic priests in Barcelona, and that no hindrance is placed bj<sup>T</sup> the Government on their priestly functions; that any limitation on that score lies entirely on the side of the Roman Catholic authorities themselves. He gives documentary evidence in support of his statement. The Hierarchy is awkwardly fixed in this matter of Spain; for the majority of the population, whether in loyal territory or that occupied by Franco, are adherents of the Roman Catholic church. But the pope has “blessed” Franco, and the Catholic clergy, as represented by the Hierarchy, wishes, to see Franco in powder. In Loyalist Spain the Hierarchy has withheld its priests from public worship: such worship as is conducted is to be considered semi-public or private, which is rather hard on the poor deluded folk who depend on their church. It does not suit the Hierarchy to let the world know that the “reds”, as they derogatorily name the Loyalists, give the Catholics full freedom to worship. The Hierarchy’s papers in Britain have been filled with accounts of atrocities said to be perpetrated by the Government; the other side of the picture, filled with acts which make the world shudder, is carefully hidden. It is probable that if the dean’s coreligionists in the Church of England had been as outspoken as he is, the world would have been saved from' the disgrace of the worst of the acts of that “fine Christian gentleman” the . leader of the “rebels”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>British Coasting Trade</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">• Besides the overseas trade which Britain has until recent years had so largely in her own hands, and which has been so profitable to the commercial interests of the country, there is a large coasting trade from port to port in the United Kingdom. But of late this traffic has been interfered with and menaced by foreign competition. At present foreign vessels are at liberty to carry goods regularly from one United Kingdom port to another without conforming to the Board of Trade regulations, so rigidly enforced in the case of British coasters. This means that the foreigner can operate his ships far more cheaply and carry trade at a good profit to himself which would mean a dead loss to a British vessel. _ The shipping correspondent of the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font5"> intimates that this undercutting has wrought serious injury to the local British firms who hitherto have had the business. He says that the manager of a British fleet of coasters at Liverpool said that at practically all ports British vessels are being cut out by foreigners, or being compelled to accept the same low rate of freight which the latter are prepared to take. British ships are being laid up and it is quite apparent, it is said, that many more crews will be thrown out of work unless the Government does something to adjust the matter. British firms who charter the fleets do not consider patriotism when there are a few pounds to be saved.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HE day is done and the fisher folk have completed the day’s work, leaving their boats drawn up on the shore, silhouetted against the dying sunset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the day has been hard, the twilight brings surcease from care, and rest in the humble cottage not far distant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sun drops imperceptibly beneath the earth’s rim, and the portals of the west blush with the last lingering kiss of parting. Nature seems to pause reluctantly as earth parts, though but for a brief space, from the companion of its waking hours. True—</span></p>
