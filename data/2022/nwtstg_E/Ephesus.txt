Ephesus




An ancient city located on the western coast of Asia Minor (in present-day Turkey). It was the capital of the Roman province of Asia and was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire.​—See ASIA.
Ephesus thrived commercially as a result of its strategic position. It had access to important sea routes of the Mediterranean and was also at the intersection of major land trade routes, including the so-called common highway, which connected Ephesus with the east as far as India. In addition, Ephesus became wealthy because visitors flocked there. Also, people entrusted funds to the famous temple of Artemis, which served as a treasury. That temple was considered to be one of the wonders of the ancient world. There were also many other temples and monuments to deities worshipped in Greece, Rome, Egypt, and Anatolia (Asia Minor). The city had the largest theater in Asia Minor, as well as a large stadium for athletic contests and gladiatorial fights. There was a State agora​—an open public area for governmental and religious functions​—and a commercial agora​—a marketplace for business.​—See App. B13, and Media Gallery, “The Theater and Surroundings in Ephesus.”
The apostle Paul visited the city a number of times. His first visit was a short stop during his second missionary tour when he was traveling from Corinth to Jerusalem. On that occasion, he left Aquila and Priscilla in Ephesus to continue the preaching work. And it was in Ephesus that this couple met Apollos and trained him. (Ac 18:18-26) When Paul was on his third missionary journey, he was able to stay longer. (Ac 19:1, 8-10; 20:31) After 61 C.E., Timothy served for some time in the congregation in Ephesus. (1Ti 1:3) Many years later, the resurrected Jesus Christ sent a message to that congregation through the apostle John.​—Re 2:1-7.
