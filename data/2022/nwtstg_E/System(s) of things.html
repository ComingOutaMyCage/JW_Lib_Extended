<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Rendering of the Greek word <em>ai·onʹ</em> when it refers to the current state of affairs or features that distinguish a certain period of time, epoch, or age. The Bible speaks of “the present system of things,” referring to the prevailing state of affairs in the world in general and the worldly way of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:10-55:4:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ti 4:10</a>) By means of the Law covenant, God introduced a system of things that some might call the Israelite or Jewish epoch. By means of his ransom sacrifice, Jesus Christ was used by God to introduce a different system of things, one primarily involving the congregation of anointed Christians. This marked the beginning of a new epoch, characterized by the realities foreshadowed by the Law covenant. When in the plural, this phrase refers to the various systems of things, or prevailing states of affairs, that have existed or will exist.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 24:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:19-41:4:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mr 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Ro 12:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:11-46:10:11" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 1Co 10:11</a>.</p>
