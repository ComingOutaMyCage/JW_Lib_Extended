TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Wait Patiently on Jehovah




David had an opportunity to end his trial (1Sa 24:3-5)
David viewed his situation from Jehovah’s standpoint and exercised restraint (1Sa 24:6, 7)
David had faith that Jehovah would resolve matters (1Sa 24:12, 15; w04 4/1 16 ¶8)
Like David, we should wait patiently on Jehovah instead of using unscriptural means to end trials.​—Jas 1:4; w04 6/1 22-23.
