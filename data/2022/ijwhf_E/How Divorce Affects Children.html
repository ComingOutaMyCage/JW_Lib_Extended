<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Research shows that the effects of divorce on children are devastating. Children of divorce are more likely to:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  experience anger, anxiety, and depression</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  develop behavioral problems</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  fall behind in school or drop out</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  be more prone to illness</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>In addition, many children blame themselves for the divorce, thinking that they either caused it or could have prevented it.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The difficulties that children of divorce face may continue into adulthood, where they are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem and an inability to trust others. They are also more likely to divorce when they have their own marital problems.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Although some people considering divorce tell themselves that it will be better for the children, research does not support that claim. “Divorce makes children miserable,” writes childcare expert Penelope Leach.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Some people would say yes. Keep in mind, though, that the needs of the parent and the needs of the child are usually not the same. The person considering divorce wants a new life. The child usually wants to cling to the one that he or she has with Dad and Mom together.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>After examining thousands of divorces, the authors of the book <em>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce</em> wrote: “One message is clear: the children do not say they are happier. Rather, they say flatly, ‘The day my parents divorced is the day my childhood ended.’” The book adds that they see the world as “a far less reliable, more dangerous place because the closest relationships in their lives can no longer be expected to hold firm.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Children are unlikely to feel happy after their parents divorce.</p>

<h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>What should I know about co-parenting?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Some divorced people try to mimic a two-parent family as much as possible, thinking that they can share equally in the duties of raising their child. However, co-parenting is difficult. Research shows that divorced spouses often:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  spend less time with their children</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  teach conflicting standards</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  yield to the children because of guilt or exhaustion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>A child of divorce could also become prone to rejecting parental authority. After all, his or her parents failed to hold on to values such as commitment or trust or sticking to agreements. ‘Why listen to <em>them?’</em> the child might reason.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Co-parenting is usually difficult for divorced spouses. But for children, the situation is even more difficult.</p>

<h2 id="p31" data-pid="31"><strong>Is there a better option?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>Often, the effort spouses must put into life after divorce would be better spent working to preserve the marriage. “The bad marriage is nowhere near as permanent a condition as we sometimes assume,” says the book <em>The Case for Marriage.</em> “With time, the marriages of most unhappy couples who stay married get much, much happier.” All things considered, children thrive best when their parents stay together.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>This does not mean that divorce is <em>never</em> an option. In fact, the Bible allows for divorce on the grounds of sexual immorality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 19:9</a>) However, the Bible also says that “the shrewd one ponders each step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>) Husbands and wives in a troubled marriage should take all factors into consideration—including the effects that divorce will have on their children.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>Of course, more might be required than just sticking it out. The Bible provides the best advice to help husbands and wives develop the qualities needed for an enduring and happy marriage. That is not surprising, since the Author of the Bible, Jehovah, created the marriage arrangement.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:4-40:19:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 19:4-6</a>.</p>
