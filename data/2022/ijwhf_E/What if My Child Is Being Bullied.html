<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>What is bullying?</strong> Bullying is <em>ongoing</em> and <em>purposeful</em> physical or emotional torment. Therefore, not every insult or hostile act constitutes bullying.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Why it matters: Some people use the term “bullying” to refer to <em>any</em> upsetting behavior, no matter how small. But by making issues over minor incidents, you could inadvertently teach your child that he is incapable of resolving conflicts​—a skill that he needs now and will need in adulthood.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><em>Bible principle: “Do not be quick to take offense.”​—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>Ecclesiastes 7:9</em></a><em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The bottom line: While some situations might require your intervention, other situations can give your child an opportunity to develop resilience and learn how to deal with people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:​13</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>Patiently listen</strong> to your child. Try to determine (1) what is happening and (2) why he is being targeted. Do not draw conclusions before you have all the facts. Ask yourself, ‘Could there be another side to the story?’ To get the full context, you might need to talk to your child’s teacher or the other child’s parents.</p>
<blockquote class="noIndent"><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><em>Bible principle: “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.”​—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>Proverbs 18:13</em></a><em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  If your child <em>is</em> being bullied, help him realize that <strong>how he responds can make things better or worse.</strong> For example, the Bible says: “A mild answer turns away rage, but a harsh word stirs up anger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:1-20:15:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:1</a>) Indeed, <strong>retaliation can backfire,</strong> causing the bullying to intensify rather than diminish.</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  Explain to your child that <strong>refusing to retaliate does not make him a weakling.</strong> On the contrary, it gives him power because he refuses to be controlled by another person. In a sense, he is beating the bully without becoming one.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>This is especially vital for your child to keep in mind if he is being cyberbullied. Getting involved in a “flame war”​—an angry online exchange​—only gives the bully permission to continue, and it could leave your child open to the charge of being a bully himself! Because of that, <strong>sometimes the best response is <em>no</em> response</strong>​—a tactic that is more likely to disarm the bully and put your child in control.</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  In some cases, your child can <strong>avoid people and places that invite bullying.</strong> For example, if he knows where a certain person or group is likely to be, he can avoid trouble by taking a different route.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>TRY THIS:</strong> Help your child think through the pros and cons of the options that are before him. For example:</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>What might happen if he simply ignores the bully?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>What if he confidently tells the bully to stop?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>What if he reports the bullying to the school?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>Can he “disarm” the bully with friendliness or humor?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>Whether the bullying is face-to-face or online, each situation is unique. So work with your child to find a solution that is practical. Assure him of your support throughout this ordeal.</p>
