<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>“Social media platforms are designed to snare your attention, keep you online, and have you repeatedly checking your screen for updates,” says the website HelpGuide.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The term <em>“social</em> media” suggests that users have friends or are connected to the people they know. Often, though, that connection is superficial.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>“I’ve noticed that many young people wrongly think that if they get more likes or followers, that means more people really care about them, even if they don’t really know those people.”—Patricia, 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Does my child have the maturity to avoid placing undue importance on followers and likes? How well can he or she cultivate <strong>off-line</strong> friendships?</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Researchers have noted that excessive use of social media is associated with feeling lonely, anxious, and even depressed.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Will my child have the maturity to avoid becoming self-focused, competitive, or unduly affected by what he or she sees others doing on social media?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>Social media is not essential for life, not even for a comfortable, happy life. Many young ones are content to live without social media—including some who once used it but then decided to quit.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><em>“After seeing how my sister was negatively affected by her use of social media, I decided to quit using it. Ever since then, I’ve been happier and I feel that I’m getting more out of life.”—Nathan, 17.</em></p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Before allowing your child to use social media, make sure he or she is mature enough to stick to time limits, maintain healthy friendships, and avoid inappropriate content.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38">“People often ‘put their best foot forward’ on social media.
