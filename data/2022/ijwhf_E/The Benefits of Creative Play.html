<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The term “creative play” refers to recreation that stimulates curiosity and imagination, thus contributing to child development and manual skills.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Examples include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Drawing</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Baking</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  Playing make-believe</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Singing</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Using building blocks</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Playing with simple objects (even a cardboard box can inspire the imagination)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>In many lands, creative play has largely been replaced by passive entertainment and organized activities.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Should you be concerned?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  <strong>Creative play can contribute to child development.</strong> It can promote physical and mental health, creativity, and social skills. It can also teach children to be patient, to improve their decision-making skills, to control their emotions, and to get along with others when playing with a group. In short, creative play can help prepare children for adulthood.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>  Overexposure to electronic media can be harmful.</strong> Too much exposure to digital media can be addictive, and exposure to too much of it has been linked to childhood obesity and aggressive behavior—a warning to parents who use electronic media as a babysitter to occupy their preschoolers.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>  Regulated activities have drawbacks.</strong> When children are ferried from one structured activity to another, they are deprived of much-needed time to engage in the kind of free play that will boost their curiosity and creativity.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>  Provide opportunities for creative play.</strong> As circumstances permit, let your children spend time outdoors so they can get acquainted with nature. Allow them to pursue hobbies and to play with toys that nurture creativity.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> What qualities and skills can creative play help my child develop, and how may he or she benefit later in life?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Physical exercise is beneficial.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, footnote.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>  Limit screen time.</strong> Think twice before letting a phone, tablet, or TV babysit your child. Pediatricians recommend no screen use for children under the age of two and no more than an hour a day for children between the ages of two and five.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> What limits can I set on screen time for my child? Should I watch with my child? What are good alternatives to electronic media?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, making the best use of your time.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:15, 16</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>  Carefully weigh organized programs.</strong> True, they can enhance your child’s proficiency in a skill or a sport. Often, though, too many organized activities add stress—not only to the child but also to the parent who may be responsible for providing transportation. Of course, the principle at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:15, 16</a> about wise use of time applies here too.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Are my children overscheduled with structured activities? If so, what adjustments could we make?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Make sure of the more important things.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Philippians 1:10</a>.</p>
