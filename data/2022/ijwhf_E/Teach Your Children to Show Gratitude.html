<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Studies indicate that grateful people are happier and healthier, cope better with adversity, and have stronger friendships. Researcher Robert A. Emmons notes that being grateful “protects a person from the destructive impulses of envy, resentment, greed, and bitterness.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>How do children benefit from being grateful? In a four-year study of 700 youths, those with a grateful attitude were less likely to cheat on tests, abuse drugs and alcohol, or have behavioral problems.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>An attitude of entitlement weakens gratitude.</strong> Many children feel that they are <strong>owed</strong> the good things that happen to them. There is little room for gratitude when a blessing is viewed as a paycheck rather than as a gift.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>That attitude is rampant today. “Our world is a workshop in entitlement,” observes a mother named Katherine. “The media bombards us with images of all the things we ‘deserve’ and tells us we should be first to get those things.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>Gratitude can be instilled early in life.</strong> A mother named Kaye observes: “Children are malleable. Teaching them good habits while they’re young is like using stakes to help a plant grow straight.”</p>

<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>  Teach the actions.</strong> Why not have your children write a thank-you note the next time someone gives them a present? Also, if you assign chores to your children, you will help them appreciate the effort it takes to keep a household functioning.</p>

<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  <strong>Teach the attitude.</strong> Think of gratitude as a plant that thrives in the soil of humility. Humble people recognize that they need help to succeed at any endeavor, and that makes them grateful to others for the support they receive.</p>
