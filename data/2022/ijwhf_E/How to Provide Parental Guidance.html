<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>In some cultures today, children have a close bond with their parents and look to them for guidance. In other cultures, children often go to their peers for direction.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The latter situation undermines parental authority. In fact, by the time such children become teenagers, their parents may feel that they have lost their influence. And no wonder! When children spend so much time with other children, it is as if they were being raised by each other instead of by their parents.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Why is it so easy for children to bond with their peers and lose their connection with parents? Consider the following factors.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>School.</strong> When children spend most of their time with other children, they form attachments and may begin to value their peers’ approval more than that of their parents. That outlook can intensify when children become teenagers.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Teen culture.</strong> By the time they reach adolescence, young people are immersed in a teen culture with its own rules of conformity, including how to dress, speak, and act. What peers think of them often matters more than what their parents think of them.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>Marketing.</strong> Businesses target many products and much entertainment exclusively toward youths, widening the generation gap even more. “If teen culture disappeared,” writes Dr. Robert Epstein, “many of these multi-billion-dollar industries would instantly collapse.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Peers can provide friendship, but they should never replace your role as a parent. The good news is this: Experts say that the majority of children and teenagers respect their parents and want to please them. If you keep a close relationship with your children, you will have more influence on them than their peers.</p>
