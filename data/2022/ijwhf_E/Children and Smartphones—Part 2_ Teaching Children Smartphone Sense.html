</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>  Children need guidance.</strong> Young people were born into the culture of technology, whereas many adults are relative newcomers to it. However, this doesn’t mean that parents are technologically incompetent and that kids are better qualified to decide how and when to use their smartphones.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Granted, your children might be more adept than you are at navigating a smartphone, but do not confuse ability with maturity. Even tech-savvy children need parental guidance when it comes to the responsible use of a smartphone.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“Giving your child a smartphone without training is like giving him the keys to a car, sitting him in the driver’s seat, starting the engine, and saying ‘Please be careful’ without first giving him driving lessons.”—Seth.</em></p>

<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>  Learn the features of your child’s phone.</strong> Become familiar with the tools that can help your child use the phone responsibly. For example:</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>Do you know that phone settings that block inappropriate content are not foolproof?</em></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>The more you know about your child’s smartphone, the better prepared you will be to help him use it responsibly.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>Make your rules known, and be prepared to enforce disciplinary measures if the rules are broken.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>  Monitor.</strong> Know your child’s password, and check the contents of his or her phone as needed, including text messages, apps, pictures, and sites visited.</p>
