<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The year 2020 saw numerous natural disasters and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. How have Jehovah’s Witnesses helped those affected?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>During the 2020 service year,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> the Coordinators’ Committee of the Governing Body approved spending 28 million dollars<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> on disaster relief. This provided relief for victims of over 200 disasters—including the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple tropical cyclones, flooding in Africa, food shortages in Venezuela, and drought in Zimbabwe. The donated funds helped pay for food, water, shelter, clothing, and medical care, as well as basic supplies for cleaning, repairs, and reconstruction. Consider a few examples of the relief work.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>COVID-19.</strong> All over the world, the pandemic affected our brothers and sisters physically, emotionally, and economically. To help them, over 800 Disaster Relief Committees (DRCs) were formed worldwide. These committees monitored our brothers’ needs and provided prompt reports that helped the Coordinators’ Committee know how best to direct the relief.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Throughout the year, DRCs helped many to obtain food, water, items for sanitation, and basic medicine. In some areas, DRCs also worked with local elders to help brothers access government aid.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Non-Witnesses have noticed our relief work. For example, Field Simwinga, the district commissioner for Nakonde, Zambia, told our brothers: “We are indebted for your timely provision of much-needed relief to the affected families.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Food Shortages in Angola.</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic affected food supplies in Angola and raised prices significantly. Many of our brothers and sisters found it increasingly difficult to buy food.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>The Brazil branch was asked to help by sending kits of food to our Angolan brothers. To make the best use of relief funds, food and logistic options were carefully researched and the food was bought in bulk. Thus, each kit cost an average of only $22 to purchase and ship but contained almost 20 kilograms (44 lb) of food items such as rice, beans, and cooking oil. To date, 33,544 kits have been shipped—a total of 654 metric tons (721 U.S. tons). Combined with local items, these provisions helped feed more than 50,000 people!</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>How do our brothers feel about this relief? Alexandre, who lives in an isolated part of Angola, says: “I see this as evidence that Jehovah loves me and that I am not alone. I am valued by Jehovah’s organization!” Mariza, a single mother, says: “Jehovah heard my cry. I thank him and his organization!”</p>

Thousands of Witnesses in Zimbabwe lacked sufficient food.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Five DRCs were formed to help provide food for our brothers. Hundreds of publishers assisted by packaging food, loading supplies, or lending their vehicles.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> During the 2020 service year, $691,561 was used to help feed more than 22,700 people!</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>In some cases, brothers had exhausted their own food supplies by the time the relief arrived. When the food arrived, our brothers praised Jehovah. Some even began singing Kingdom songs.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>In one area, two widowed Witnesses attended a community meeting organized to discuss the food relief being offered by a nongovernmental organization (NGO). However, the meeting became increasingly political, so the sisters decided that they could not accept the conditions for receiving aid. As they left the meeting, they were mocked and told, “Don’t come looking for a meal from us!” However, just two weeks later, our brothers reached the area and provided our sisters with food relief—well before the NGO relief arrived!</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>Disaster relief in Zimbabwe has also resulted in a good witness. For example, consider the experience of Prisca, who lives in a small village. Despite the difficulties brought on by the drought, Prisca devoted each Wednesday and Friday to the ministry, even during plowing season. People in her village ridiculed her, saying: “You are going to starve your family because of your preaching.” Prisca would reply: “Jehovah has never failed his servants.” Not long after that, she received relief supplies from our organization. This impressed some of her neighbors, who told Prisca: “God has never failed you, so we want to learn more about him.” Seven neighbors are now listening to congregation meetings that are broadcast on radio.</p>
