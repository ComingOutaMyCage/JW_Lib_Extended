<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Jesus did not command his followers to have or not to have children. Neither did any of Jesus’ disciples issue any such directive. Nowhere does the Bible explicitly condemn birth control. In this matter, the principle outlined at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 14:12</a> applies: “Each of us will render an account for himself to God.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Married couples, therefore, are free to decide for themselves whether they will raise a family or not. They may also decide how many children they will have and when they will have them. If a husband and wife choose to use a nonabortive form of contraception to avoid pregnancy, that is their personal decision and responsibility. No one should judge them.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:4-45:14:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 14:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:10-45:14:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10-13</a>.</p>
