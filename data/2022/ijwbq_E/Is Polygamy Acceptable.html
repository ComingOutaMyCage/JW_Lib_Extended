<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>For a time, God did permit a man to have more than one wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:19-1:4:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:1-1:16:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:29:18-1:29:29" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 29:18-29</a>) But God did not originate the practice of polygamy. He provided only one wife for Adam.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>God authorized Jesus Christ to reinstitute His original standard of monogamy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:28-43:8:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 8:28</a>) When asked about marriage, Jesus said: “He who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:4-40:19:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 19:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>One of Jesus’ disciples was later inspired by God to write: “Let each man have his own wife and each woman have her own husband.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:2-46:7:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>) The Bible also states that any married man in the Christian congregation who is given special responsibilities must be “a husband of one wife.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:2-54:3:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:12-54:3:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>
