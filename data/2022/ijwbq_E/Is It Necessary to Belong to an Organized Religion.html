<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes, because God wants people to gather for worship. The Bible says: “Let us consider one another so as to motivate to love and fine works, not forsaking our meeting together.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>, footnote.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Jesus indicated that his followers would form an organized group when he said to them: “By this all will know that you are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) As a primary way of showing this love, disciples of Christ would associate with fellow believers. They would be organized into congregations that meet regularly for worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:19-46:16:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>) Collectively, they would form a worldwide brotherhood.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:​17</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>More is needed than just belonging to a religion</strong></h3>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>While the Bible shows that people should gather to worship God, it does not teach that a person can please God by just being a member of a religion. To be approved by God, a person’s religion must <a class="xt" data-xtid="24" href="jwpub://p/E:1102012198/">affect his everyday life</a>. For example, the Bible says: “The religion that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 1:​27</a>, footnote.</p>
