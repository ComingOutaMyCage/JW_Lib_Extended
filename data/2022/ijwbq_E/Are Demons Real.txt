Are Demons Real?



The Bible’s answer

Yes. Demons are “angels that sinned,” spirit creatures who rebelled against God. (2 Peter 2:4) The first angel to make himself into a demon was Satan the Devil, whom the Bible calls “the ruler of the demons.”—Matthew 12:24, 26.
Rebellion in Noah’s day
The Bible records a rebellion by angels before the Flood of Noah’s day: “The sons of the true God began to notice the daughters of men, that they were good-looking; and they went taking wives for themselves, namely, all whom they chose.” (Genesis 6:2) Those wicked, or fallen, angels “forsook their own proper dwelling place” in heaven and materialized human bodies in order to have sex with women.—Jude 6.
When the Flood came, the rebellious angels abandoned their human bodies and returned to heaven. However, God expelled them from his family. As part of their punishment, the demons are prevented from ever again taking on human form.—Ephesians 6:11, 12.
