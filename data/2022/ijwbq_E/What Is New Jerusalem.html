(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:12-66:3:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 3:​12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 21:​2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:10-66:21:10" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:12-66:21:12" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 12</a>) Also, the city’s great size proves that it could not be on earth.

<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>              <strong>New Jerusalem is made up of a group of Jesus’ followers, the bride of Christ.</strong> New Jerusalem is called “the bride, the Lamb’s wife.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:​9, 10</a>) In this symbolic description, the Lamb refers to Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 1:​29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:12-66:5:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Revelation 5:​12</a>) “The Lamb’s wife,” Christ’s bride, represents Christians who will be united with Jesus in heaven. The Bible likens the relationship between Jesus and these Christians to that of a husband and wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:2-47:11:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:23-49:5:25" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:​23-​25</a>) In addition, the foundation stones of New Jerusalem are inscribed with “the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:14-66:21:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 21:14</a>) This detail helps to confirm the identity of New Jerusalem, since Christians who are called to life in heaven are “built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:​20</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:1-16:11:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nehemiah 11:1</a>) New Jerusalem, also called “the holy city,” is made up of those who join Jesus in heaven “to rule as kings over the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 5:​9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 21:2</a>.</p>
