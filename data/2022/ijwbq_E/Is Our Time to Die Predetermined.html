<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>No, we do not have a predetermined time to die. Rather than supporting belief in fate, the Bible says that death is often due to “unexpected events.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:​11</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Doesn’t the Bible say that there is “a time to die”?</strong></h3>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Yes, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:2-21:3:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a> says that there is “a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.” (<em>King James Version</em>) However, the context of this verse shows that the Bible is discussing the continuing cycles that are common to life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:​1-8</a>) God has not set our personal time to die any more than he forces a farmer to plant at a particular moment. Instead, the point is that we should avoid being so preoccupied with mundane matters that we neglect our Creator.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:​11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12:​1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:13-21:12:13" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Life can be extended</strong></h3>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Despite life’s uncertainties, we can often live longer if we make wise decisions. The Bible says: “The teaching of the wise one is a source of life to turn one away from the snares of death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:14-20:13:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:14</a>) Likewise, Moses told the Israelites that they could “live a long time” if they obeyed God’s commands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:2-5:6:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>) In contrast, we can carelessly shorten our life by bad or foolish actions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:17-21:7:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:​17</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>No matter how wise or careful we are, though, <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502013276/">we cannot escape death</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 5:​12</a>) Yet, this situation will change, for the Bible promises a time when “death will be no more.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>
