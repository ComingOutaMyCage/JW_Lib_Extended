<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes. God cares about his servants who are sick. Regarding a faithful servant, the Bible says: “Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:3-19:41:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 41:3</a>) If you are living with chronic illness, the following three steps can help you to cope:</p>
<ol><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>              <strong>Pray for strength to endure.</strong> You can receive “the peace of God that excels all thought,” which can reduce your anxiety and sustain you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>              <strong>Be positive.</strong> The Bible says: “Being cheerful keeps you healthy. It is slow death to be gloomy all the time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:22</a>, <em>Good News Translation</em>) Cultivate your sense of humor, since this not only can lighten dark times but also can benefit your health.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>              <strong>Build your hope in the future.</strong> A sound hope can help you have joy despite chronic ailments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 12:12</a>) The Bible foretells a time when “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a>) God will then cure chronic illnesses that are beyond the power of modern science to solve. For example, the Bible describes the reversal of the aging process this way: “Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:25-18:33:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 33:25</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Note: While acknowledging the help that God provides, Jehovah’s Witnesses also seek medical treatment for chronic illness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:2:17-41:2:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 2:17</a>) We do not, however, endorse any specific medical approach; we feel that each person should make his own health decisions.</p>
