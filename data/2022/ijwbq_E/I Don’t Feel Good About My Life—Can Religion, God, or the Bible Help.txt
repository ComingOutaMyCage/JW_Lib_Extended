I Don’t Feel Good About My Life—Can Religion, God, or the Bible Help?



The Bible’s answer

Yes. The Bible, an ancient book of wisdom, provides answers to life’s important questions and can help you to feel better and have a sense of well-being. Consider some questions that it answers.
               Is there a Creator? The Bible says that God “created all things.” (Revelation 4:11) As our Creator, God knows what we need to feel good and to find fulfillment in life.

               Does God care about me? Rather than portraying God as aloof from mankind, the Bible says: “He is not far off from each one of us.” (Acts 17:27) He is interested in what happens to you and wants to help you succeed in life.—Isaiah 48:17, 18; 1 Peter 5:7.

               How can knowing God help me to feel better? God created us with a “spiritual need,” an innate hunger to understand the meaning and purpose of life. (Matthew 5:3) Our spiritual need also includes a desire to know our Creator and to have a relationship with him. God will welcome your efforts to get to know him, for the Bible says: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.”—James 4:8.


Millions of people have found that building a friendship with God has improved their overall well-being and shown them how to feel good about their lives. While knowing God will not make your life trouble-free, his wisdom found in the Bible can help you to
  Have a happier family life.

  Enjoy peace with others.

  Deal with problems as varied as depression, stress about money, and chronic illness.


Many religions that use the Bible do not actually follow its teachings. In contrast, true religion, which adheres to what the Bible really says, will help you to get to know God.
