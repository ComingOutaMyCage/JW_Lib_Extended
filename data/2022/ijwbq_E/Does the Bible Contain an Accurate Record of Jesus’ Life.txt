Does the Bible Contain an Accurate Record of Jesus’ Life?



The Bible’s answer

The Bible writer Luke said regarding his account of Jesus’ life: “I have traced all things from the start with accuracy.”—Luke 1:3.
Some claim that accounts of Jesus’ life as recorded in the Gospels—the writings of his contemporaries Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—were altered sometime in the fourth century.
However, a valuable fragment of John’s Gospel was found in Egypt at the turn of the 20th century. It is now known as the Papyrus Rylands 457 (P52) and is preserved at the John Rylands Library, Manchester, England. It contains what is John 18:31-33, 37, 38 in modern Bibles.
This is the oldest known manuscript fragment of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Many scholars believe that it was written about 125 C.E., a mere quarter of a century or so after the original was written. The text of the fragment agrees nearly exactly with that in later manuscripts.
