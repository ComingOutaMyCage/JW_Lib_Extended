(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:5-66:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:12-66:20:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 20:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:16-39:3:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Malachi 3:16</a>) God determines those names based on a person’s faithful obedience to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>God has kept each of his loyal servants in his memory, as if writing their names down in a book, since “the founding of the world” of mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:8-66:17:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 17:8</a>) The faithful man Abel was apparently the first one whose name was recorded in the book of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:4-58:11:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:4</a>) It is not just a cold list of names, though, for the book of life shows us that <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012489/">Jehovah</a> is a loving God who “knows those who belong to him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:19-55:2:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:8</a>.</p>
