<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>No. The Bible shows that we should pray only to God, in Jesus’ name. Jesus told his disciples: “This is how you are to pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>, <em>New American Bible</em>) Never did he instruct his disciples to pray to saints, angels, or anyone other than God.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Jesus also told his followers: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>, <em>NAB</em>) Only Jesus is authorized by God to intercede on our behalf.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:25-58:7:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:25</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>What if I pray to God and also pray to saints?</strong></h3>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>As part of the Ten Commandments, God said: “I, the LORD, your God, am a jealous God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:5-2:20:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 20:5</a>, <em>NAB</em>) In what way is God “jealous”? The footnote in the <em>New American Bible</em> says that he is “demanding exclusive allegiance.” God demands that acts of allegiance or worship—including prayer—be directed exclusively to him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:11-23:48:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>We offend God if we pray to anyone else, even to saints or holy angels. When the apostle John tried to worship an angel, the angel stopped him by saying: “Don’t! I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brothers who bear witness to Jesus. Worship God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 19:10</a>, <em>NAB.</em></p>
