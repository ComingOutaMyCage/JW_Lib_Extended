Does God Live in a Specific Location?



The Bible’s answer

Yes. God lives in a specific place—the heavens. Consider these Bible passages:
In a prayer, King Solomon said: “May you yourself listen from the heavens, your established place of dwelling.”—1 Kings 8:43.
Jesus Christ taught his disciples to address their prayers to their “Father in the heavens.”—Matthew 6:9.
After Jesus was resurrected, he entered “into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God.”—Hebrews 9:24.
Those verses clearly indicate that Jehovah God is a real person and that he dwells, not everywhere, but only in heaven.
