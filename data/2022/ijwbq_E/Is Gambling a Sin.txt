Is Gambling a Sin?



The Bible’s answer

Although the Bible does not discuss gambling in detail, we can discern from Bible principles that God views gambling as a sin.​—Ephesians 5:​17.a
  Gambling is driven by greed, which God hates. (1 Corinthians 6:​9, 10; Ephesians 5:​3, 5) Gamblers hope to gain money through the losses of others, but the Bible condemns coveting other people’s possessions.​—Exodus 20:17; Romans 7:7; 13:​9, 10.

  Gambling, even for small amounts, can arouse a destructive love of money.​—1 Timothy 6:​9, 10.

  Gamblers often rely on superstitions or luck. However, God views such beliefs as a form of idolatry, which is incompatible with his worship.​—Isaiah 65:11.

  Rather than promote a desire to get something for nothing, the Bible encourages hard work. (Ecclesiastes 2:​24; Ephesians 4:​28) Those who follow the Bible’s advice can “eat food they themselves earn.”​—2 Thessalonians 3:​10, 12.

  Gambling can arouse an unhealthy competitive spirit, which is disapproved in the Bible.​—Galatians 5:​26.





a Gambling is specifically mentioned in the Bible only in connection with the Roman soldiers who cast lots, or “gambled,” for Jesus’ clothing.​—Matthew 27:35; John 19:23, 24; Contemporary English Version; Good News Translation.
