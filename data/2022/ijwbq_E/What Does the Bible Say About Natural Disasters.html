<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>God does not cause the natural disasters occurring today, but he is concerned about people who are affected by them. Natural disasters are one of the causes of suffering that God’s Kingdom will eliminate. In the meantime, God provides comfort for those who are affected by natural disasters.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Natural disasters differ from God’s use of natural forces, as recorded in the Bible.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Natural disasters kill and maim indiscriminately.</strong> In contrast, God’s acts of judgment recorded in the Bible were selective. For example, when God destroyed the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, he spared the good man Lot and his two daughters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:29-1:19:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 19:29, 30</a>) God read the hearts of the individuals of that time and destroyed only those he deemed wicked.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:23-1:18:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 18:23-​32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 16:7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Natural disasters usually strike with little or no warning.</strong> On the other hand, God gave warnings to the wicked before using natural forces against them.

</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>To some extent, humans have contributed to natural disasters.</strong> How? By damaging the natural environment and by building in areas prone to earthquakes, floods, and extreme weather. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 11:18</a>) God is not to blame for such human choices.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:3-20:19:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:3</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Yes, Bible prophecies suggest that there would be disasters during “the conclusion of the system of things,” or “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502016185/">the last days</a>.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:1</a>) For example, concerning our time, Jesus said: “There will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>) Soon, God will rid the earth of all causes of pain and suffering, including natural disasters.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 21:​3, 4</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>God comforts victims with his Word, the Bible.</strong> The Bible assures us that God cares for us and that he feels for us when we suffer.

</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  <strong>God helps victims by means of his worshippers.</strong> God uses his worshippers on earth to imitate the example set by Jesus. It was prophesied that Jesus would comfort “the brokenhearted” and “all who mourn.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:1-23:61:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 61:​1, 2</a>) Worshippers of God strive to do the same.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:15-43:13:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 13:15</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Yes. Although the Bible is not a manual for disaster preparedness, it contains principles that can help. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  <strong>Plan ahead for potential disasters.</strong> “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>) We are wise to prepare an emergency plan in advance. Such planning may include assembling an emergency kit that is ready to go in case of an emergency and rehearsing with one’s family where to meet if a disaster occurs.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  <strong>Value life over possessions.</strong> The Bible acknowledges: “We have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:7-54:6:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:​7, 8</a>) We need to be willing to leave our home and possessions in order to escape disaster. We do well to remember that our life is more important than any material things.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:25" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 6:​25</a>.</p>
