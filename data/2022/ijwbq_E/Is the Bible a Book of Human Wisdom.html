<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible, also known as the Holy Scriptures, does contain many wise sayings. However, note the claim that the Bible makes for itself: “All Scripture is inspired of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) There is much evidence to back up that claim. Consider the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  No one has ever successfully challenged the historical accuracy of the Bible.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  The Bible writers were honest men who wrote with openness of heart. Their candor gives their writing the clear ring of truth.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  The Bible has one central theme: the vindication of God’s right to rule mankind and the fulfillment of his purpose by means of his heavenly Kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  Although written thousands of years ago, the Bible is free of mistaken scientific ideas that had gained wide acceptance in ancient times.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Documented historical evidence proves that Bible prophecies, or predictions, have come true.</p>

</ul>
