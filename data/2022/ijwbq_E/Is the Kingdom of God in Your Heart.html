For example, the <em>King James Version</em> says that “the kingdom of God is within you.” To understand this verse correctly, we must consider the context.</p>

Jesus told them: “Inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:27-40:23:28" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 23:27, 28</a>.</p>

For example, in the United States, the Southern Baptist Convention declared that the Kingdom of God is in part “the reign of God in the heart and life of the individual.” Similarly, in his book <em>Jesus of Nazareth,</em> Pope Benedict XVI stated that “the Kingdom of God comes by way of a listening heart.”</p></div>
