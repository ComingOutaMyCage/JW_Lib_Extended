<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Human efforts to bring world peace have failed and will continue to fail for several reasons:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>) Humans weren’t created with the ability or the right to rule themselves, so they won’t be able to achieve enduring peace.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  “Don’t put your trust in human leaders; no human being can save you. When they die, they return to the dust; on that day all their plans come to an end.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4</a>, <em>Good News Translation</em>) Government leaders, even those with the best motives, can’t devise lasting solutions for the root causes of war.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be . . . fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1–4</a>) We live in “the last days” of the present wicked world, a time when prevailing attitudes make peace difficult.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>) The Devil, God’s enemy, has been confined to the vicinity of the earth and motivates people to adopt his vicious spirit. As long as he is “the ruler of this world,” we can never live in peace.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 12:31</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  “[God’s Kingdom] will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms [that oppose God], and it itself will stand to times indefinite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>) God’s Kingdom, not any human government, will satisfy our desire for permanent world peace.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 145:16</a>.</p>
