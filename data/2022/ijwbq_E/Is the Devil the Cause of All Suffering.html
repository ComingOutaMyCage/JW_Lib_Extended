<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible reveals that Satan the Devil is a real person who, like a powerful criminal kingpin, sees to it that his will is accomplished through “lying signs” and “deception.” In fact, he “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:9-53:2:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:14-47:11:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 11:14</a>) The Devil’s existence can be perceived by the damage he causes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>However, the Devil is not responsible for all suffering. Why not? God created humans with the capacity to choose between doing good and doing bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:15-6:24:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 24:15</a>) When we make poor choices, we reap bad consequences.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7, 8</a>.</p>
