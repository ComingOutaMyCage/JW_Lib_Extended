<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Jesus saved faithful humans when he gave his life as a ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) Thus, the Bible calls Jesus the “Savior of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:14-62:4:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:​14</a>) It also states: “There is no <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502016130/">salvation</a> in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:12-44:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 4:​12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Jesus ‘tasted death for everyone’ who exercises faith in him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:9-58:2:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> John 3:​16</a>) Thereafter, “God raised him up from the dead,” and Jesus returned to heaven as a spirit creature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:15-44:3:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 3:​15</a>) There, Jesus is able “to save completely those who are approaching God through him, because he is always alive to plead for them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:25-58:7:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:​25</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Why do we need Jesus to plead for us?</strong></h3>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>We are all sinners. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 3:​23</a>) <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502015233/">Sin</a> puts a barrier between us and God, and it leads to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 6:​23</a>) But Jesus serves as “an advocate” for those who exercise faith in his <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502016129/">ransom sacrifice</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 2:1</a>, footnote) He pleads in their behalf, asking God to hear their prayers and grant forgiveness of their sins on the basis of Jesus’ sacrificial death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:21-40:1:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 1:​21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:34-45:8:34" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Romans 8:​34</a>) God acts on such pleas made by Jesus because they are in harmony with His will. God sent Jesus to the earth “for the world to be saved through him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:17-43:3:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 3:​17</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Is belief in Jesus all that we need to be saved?</strong></h3>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>No. Although we must believe in Jesus to gain salvation, more is required. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:30-44:16:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 16:30, 31</a>) The Bible says: “Just as the body without spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:26-59:2:26" data-bid="13-1" class="b">James 2:​26</a>) To be saved, we must:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  Learn about Jesus and his Father, Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Build faith in them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:44-43:12:44" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 12:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:1-43:14:1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 14:1</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Demonstrate our faith by obeying their commands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:46-42:6:46" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 6:​46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:17-62:2:17" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:​17</a>) Jesus taught that not everyone who called him “Lord” would be saved but only those <em>“doing</em> the will of [his] Father who is in the heavens.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 7:​21</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Continue to demonstrate our faith despite hardships. Jesus made that clear when he said: “The one who has endured to the end will be saved.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:13-40:24:13" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 24:13</a>.</p>
