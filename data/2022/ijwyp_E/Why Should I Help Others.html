<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span><strong>Secret #1:</strong> When you give, you are likely to get back!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>People will notice that you are generous. As a result, they’ll probably be generous to <em>you.</em> The Bible puts it this way:</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>“Practice giving, and people will give to you. . . . With the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you in return.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:38-42:6:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 6:​38</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>“The way you treat others is the way you will be treated.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:38-42:6:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 6:​38</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Secret #2:</strong> When you help others, you help yourself!</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Doing good things for others boosts your self-respect and makes you feel the satisfaction that comes from giving. The Bible puts it this way:</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>“There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>“When you spread a feast, invite poor people, crippled, lame, blind; and you will be happy, because they have nothing with which to repay you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:13-42:14:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 14:13, 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>“Sometimes when I just want to sit on the couch and watch TV, I think about my mom and dad, who are working, and how tired they are going to be when they come home. So I get up and wash the dishes, vacuum, and dust. I’ll also make a pot of coffee because my parents love coffee. When my mom gets home, she says, ‘Oh, it looks so nice in here! And it smells good too. Thank you so much, Sweetie!’ It always makes me feel good to do something nice like that for my mom and dad.”​—Casey.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>“My parents have always supported me, providing me with everything I need. So when they had a major problem with the car last year, I wrote a check to have it repaired, even though it was a large part of my savings. Of course, they tried to refuse my offer, but I wouldn’t take no for an answer. My parents deserve so much more than even that. And it felt great to be generous and give them something.”​—Holly.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> Many young people among Jehovah’s Witnesses have experienced the joy of helping others through their Bible education work. Some have even moved to a foreign land where there is a need for Bible teachers.</p>

Sometimes it’s difficult to be generous with money or things because I don’t really have much to give. But I’ve found that when I give of my time and energy in the ministry, that’s more appreciated than just giving materially.”​—Evan.</p>
