What if I’m Addicted to Pornography?



What you can do

Understand pornography for what it is. Pornography is nothing less than an attempt to degrade something that God created to be honorable. Understanding pornography in this light will help you to “hate what is bad.”—Psalm 97:10.
Consider the consequences. Pornography devalues those depicted in it. It also debases the person who views it. For good reason, the Bible says: “Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself.”—Proverbs 22:3.
Make a commitment. “I have made a solemn promise never to look with lust at a girl,” said the faithful man Job. (Job 31:1, Today’s English Version) The following are some ‘solemn promises’ you could make:
I will not use the Internet when I am alone.

I will immediately exit from any pop-up or site that is explicit.

I will talk to a mature friend if I have a relapse.






Pornography has a cumulative effect—the more times you view it, the harder it is to break free



Pray about it. The psalmist implored Jehovah God: “Make my eyes pass on from seeing what is worthless.” (Psalm 119:37) God wants you to succeed, and if you pray to him he can give you the strength to do what is right!—Philippians 4:13.
Talk to someone. Choosing a confidant is often an important step in breaking the habit.—Proverbs 17:17.
Remember this: Each time you avoid pornography, you have won a significant victory. Tell Jehovah God about that victory, and thank him for the strength he has given you. By avoiding pornography, you make his heart rejoice!—Proverbs 27:11.
