<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>“The best worst friends”</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Siblings have been called “the best worst friends you’ll ever have.” You love them, and they love you​—but sometimes you just can’t seem to get along. “My younger brother annoys me,” says 18-year-old Helena. “He knows exactly which buttons to push and when to push them to get the biggest rise out of me!”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Some sibling conflicts can be solved with simple communication and negotiation skills. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Two brothers who share a room might argue over privacy. The solution? Learn to compromise and allow each other needed space. Apply the Bible principle found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:31-42:6:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 6:​31</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Two sisters might “borrow” each other’s clothing items without asking. The solution? Talk it out and set reasonable boundaries. Apply the Bible principle found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:24-55:2:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:​24</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>In some cases, problems between siblings are more serious and can have severe consequences. Consider two examples from the Bible:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Miriam and Aaron were jealous of their brother, Moses, with tragic results. Read the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:1-4:12:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 12:​1-​15</a>. Then ask yourself: ‘How can I keep from being jealous of my sibling?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Cain’s anger grew to the point that he murdered his brother Abel. Read the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:1-1:4:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 4:​1-​12</a>. Then ask yourself: ‘How can I control my anger when dealing with my brother or sister?’</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section3" class="section">
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Two reasons to make peace</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>No matter how hard it is to get along with your siblings, there are at least two reasons why it’s worth the effort.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>               <strong>It’s a sign of maturity.</strong> “I used to have a short fuse with my two younger sisters,” says a young man named Alex. “Now I’m much more calm and patient with them. You could say I’ve grown up.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>The Bible says: “The one who is slow to anger has great discernment, but the impatient one displays his foolishness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:29-20:14:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:29</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>               <strong>It’s good training for the future.</strong> If you can’t tolerate the imperfections of your siblings, how will you deal with a spouse, a workmate, an employer, or anyone else you have to interact with?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Fact of life: The success of your future relationships will depend on your ability to communicate and negotiate, and there’s no better place to cultivate such skills than within your family.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>The Bible says: “As far as it depends on you, be peaceable.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:18-45:12:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 12:18</a>.</p>
