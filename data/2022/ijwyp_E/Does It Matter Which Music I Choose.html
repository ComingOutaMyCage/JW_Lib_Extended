<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Listening to music can be compared to eating food. In both cases, the right type in the right amount can be good for you. Consider:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Music can improve your mood.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><em>“If I’m having a bad day, I can put on my favorite music and get almost immediate relief.”​—Mark.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Music can take you back in time.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>“Often, a particular song will remind me of a fond memory, so I’m happy every time I hear it.”​—Sheila.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  <strong>Music can create a powerful bond of unity.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>“I was at an international convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and as all the visitors sang the final song, I was moved to tears. We spoke different languages, but the music united us.”​—Tammy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  <strong>Music can help you cultivate valuable qualities.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><em>“Learning to play a musical instrument helps you develop discipline and patience. It’s not something you can master quickly. The only way to get better at it is through practice.”​—Anna.</em></p>

<h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>The pitfalls</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>Some music, like tainted food, can be poisonous. Consider why.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>  Many songs contain sexually explicit lyrics.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><em>“It seems as if all the popular songs are just about sex. They don’t even try to cover it up anymore.”​—Hannah.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness or greediness not even be mentioned among you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3</a>) Ask yourself, ‘Does my music hinder me from following that admonition?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  <strong>Some music can immerse you in sadness.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><em>“Sometimes I lie awake at night listening to music that makes me think about things that depress and overwhelm me. Sad music can bring dark thoughts into my mind.”​—Tammy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Above all the things that you guard, safeguard your heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:23-20:4:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:​23</a>) Ask yourself, ‘Does my music make me focus on negative thoughts?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>  Some music can incite you to anger.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><em>“Angry, self-loathing, hateful music is a subtle danger to me. I noticed a marked difference in my mood after I would listen to that kind of music. My family noticed it too.”​—John.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Put them all away from you: wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:8-51:3:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 3:8</a>) Ask yourself, ‘Does my music make me aggressive, perhaps even calloused to others’ feelings?’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>The bottom line? Be selective. That’s what a teenager named Julie tries to do. “I’m constantly going through my music and deleting anything that I realize is inappropriate,” she says. “It’s not always easy, but I know it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>A young woman named Tara is learning something similar. She says: “At times a song with a great beat will come on the radio, but then I’ll hear the lyrics and realize that I should change the station. Doing that is like tearing myself away from an amazing cinnamon roll after just one bite! But if I have the strength to reject a <em>song</em> about sex, I’ll more likely have the strength to reject the <em>act</em> of sex before marriage. I don’t want to underestimate the effect that my music can have on me.”</p>
