<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>The Bible tells us not to think more of ourselves “than it is necessary to think.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 12:3</a>) So it’s proper​—even necessary​—to think about yourself to a degree.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span>What, though, if you frequently get discouraged over your body image​—perhaps to the point of being obsessed about it? If that’s the case, you might wonder . . .</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span>There could be several reasons. These include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>Influence of the media.</strong> “Young people are bombarded with images that make us feel that we have to be superskinny and gorgeous at all times. As a result, if we’re anything less than perfect, we feel disgusting!”​—Kellie.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><strong>Influence of parents.</strong> “I’ve noticed that if a mother is obsessed with her body image, often the daughter views herself the same way. It can be the same with fathers and sons.”​—Rita.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong>Low self-esteem.</strong> “People who are obsessed with their body image constantly demand positive reinforcement from others about how they look. It gets tiring to be around that!”​—Jeanne.</p>

</ul>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="36"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Do what you can to look your best. But don’t worry about the rest.

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"></span>On the other hand, a balanced attitude will help you view yourself realistically, as a young woman named Erin learned. “Sure, I have insecurities,” she says, “but I notice that I feel bad only when I focus on the wrong things. Now I just exercise regularly and eat right. The rest falls into place naturally.”</p>

<div class="boxContent"><blockquote><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">When I was 16, I had major issues with my weight. I’ve never been overweight, but I’m not naturally skinny either. I was curvy. I thought that just maybe, if I were slender, guys would like me. So I almost starved myself in order to achieve the body I wanted.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">I got skinny, but I ended up with health problems as a result. These were addressed, but the emotional effects are still there. To this day, I have issues with food. I’ve slowly come to terms with my body. I eat right and exercise. But when I’m upset with myself about something, my automatic reaction is to punish myself by not eating.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">If I could, I would tell other young people to remember that everyone has a different perspective. No matter what you look like, there will always be some people who think you’re attractive and others who don’t. The important thing is that you’re healthy. <em>That’s</em> what matters to those who truly care about you.</p>
