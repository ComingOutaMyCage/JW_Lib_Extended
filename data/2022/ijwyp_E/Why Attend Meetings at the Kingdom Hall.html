<blockquote><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>“A classmate came to one of the meetings. He sat with our family, and we shared our books with him. Afterward, he told me that he was really impressed with the comments people gave during the audience-participation parts. He also said that at his church they don’t have study material like we do.”​—Brenda.</em></p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>Did you know?</em> Seats are free at the Kingdom Hall, and no collections are ever taken.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>The association will encourage you.</strong> The Bible says that one reason Christians should meet together is to be “encouraging one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) Good association among people who put God and others before themselves is refreshing in this largely self-centered world.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><em>“After a long day, I may feel sad and run-down, but the people at the Kingdom Hall always make me feel better. On my way home after a meeting, I feel happy and ready to tackle another day.”​—Elisa.</em></p>
