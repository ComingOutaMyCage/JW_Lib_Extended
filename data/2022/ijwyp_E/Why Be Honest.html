<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Why some people are dishonest</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>In today’s world, honesty could seem to be a disadvantage. After all, some might reason:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  ‘If I don’t <strong>lie</strong> to my parents, I could <strong>get grounded.’</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  ‘If I don’t <strong>cheat</strong> on this test, I might <strong>fail</strong> it.’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  ‘If I don’t <strong>steal</strong> this item, I’ll have to <strong>save up</strong> for it.’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>‘Besides, what’s the big deal?’ some might ask. ‘Isn’t <em>everyone</em> dishonest?’</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The answer to that question is <em>no.</em> Many people​—including a large number of young people​—believe that honesty pays, and for good reason. “Whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) In other words, our actions always have consequences​—whether for good or for bad.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Consider, for example, some bad consequences people have reaped from lying.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span> <em>“I lied to my mom about talking to a certain boy. She had clear evidence that I wasn’t telling the truth. After the third time I lied about this, Mom had had enough. I was grounded for two weeks and could not use my cell phone or watch TV for a month. I never lied to my parents again!”​—Anita.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Why might it take some time for Anita to regain her mom’s trust?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Now that you have put away deceit, each one of you speak truth with his neighbor.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:25-49:4:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:25</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span> <em>“I lied to my parents and thought I got away with it until later when they made me recount what I said had happened. It was so far from the truth that I couldn’t even remember the details of my story. When you tell the truth to begin with, you don’t have that problem!”​—Anthony.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> How could Anthony have avoided that embarrassing situation?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Lying lips are detestable to Jehovah, but those acting faithfully bring pleasure to him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:22-20:12:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:22</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span> <em>“I have a friend who embellishes her stories. She exaggerates and takes things out of context. I love her and I try not to read too much into it. But it’s really hard to believe her or trust her.”​—Yvonne.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> How might exaggerations and “small” untruths affect the reputation of Yvonne’s friend?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>Now consider some of the good consequences you can reap by being honest.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span> <em>“A woman walking ahead of me had dropped some money. I called out to her and returned her money. She was so thankful. She said: ‘That was very nice of you. Not many people are honest enough to do that.’ It felt good to be noticed for doing the right thing!”​—Vivian.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Why might the woman have been surprised to see such honesty? How did being honest benefit Vivian?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Happy are those who . . . always do what is right.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:3-19:106:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 106:3</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span> <em>“As a family, we work in the janitorial business, and sometimes while we’re cleaning an office, we’ll see a coin lying on the floor. When that happens, we put the coin on the nearest desk. One employee was almost annoyed that we were so honest​—‘It’s just a dime!’ she said. But you know what? We always had her confidence.”​—Julia.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> How might Julia’s reputation for honesty pay off when she needs a character reference for another job?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:​15</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span> <em>“I received a paycheck for 80 hours of work instead of 64. Although it would have been nice to keep it, I just couldn’t do that. I pointed it out to the accounting manager, and she was very grateful. The company is successful, but I wasn’t about to keep what would have felt like stolen money.”​—Bethany.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Is stealing from a corporation any less dishonest than stealing from a person?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Jehovah detests a devious person, but His close friendship is with the upright.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:32-20:3:32" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:32</a>.</p>
