<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>If so, it’s only natural for you to be discouraged at times. The Bible, however, contains two very comforting thoughts.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Your Creator, Jehovah God, knows your situation. More than that, “he cares for you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Jehovah God’s purpose is to cure all sickness! You can read about that in the Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1-4</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>At age five, I was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, a degenerative illness that greatly limits me. At times, I get discouraged because I can’t do the things that others my age can. But my parents and those in my congregation give me physical, emotional, and spiritual support. I serve as a full-time minister, and fellow Christians often accompany me as I conduct Bible studies with interested ones.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Jesus said that each day has its own anxieties. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:34</a>) So I try to take one day at a time and set realistic goals for myself that I can reach and achieve. I look forward to the day in God’s new world when I will be able to have “the real life,” free of this debilitating illness.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:19-54:6:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>I had an operation, but the surgeon was able to remove only about 40 percent of the tumor. And then—in just two months—the tumor was back to its original size! Since then, I’ve had many examinations, many treatments, and many disappointments.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>At times, the tumor causes pain like knife stabs all over, but mostly in my back and chest. Still, I try not to be consumed with my situation. I remind myself that others have endured terrible things too, and yet they’ve remained positive. My greatest help in maintaining a positive attitude is my confidence that one day Jehovah God will fulfill his promise to end all suffering.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>
