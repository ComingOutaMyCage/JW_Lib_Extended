<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Why do it?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Many learn another language because it’s a required part of their schooling. Others have a personal incentive. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Anna, a young woman in Australia, decided to learn Latvian​—her mother’s native tongue. “Our family is planning a trip to Latvia,” says Anna, “and I’d like to be able to communicate with my relatives there when we visit.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Gina, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses from the United States, learned American Sign Language (ASL) and moved to Belize to expand her ministry. “A deaf person’s world may consist of just a handful of people he or she can communicate with,” she explains. “People really appreciate it when I tell them that I learned ASL in order to teach the Bible in their language!”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> The Bible foretold that the good news of God’s Kingdom would be proclaimed to people of “every nation and tribe and language.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 14:6</a>, footnote) In fulfillment of this prophecy, many young people among Jehovah’s Witnesses have taken up another language to expand their ministry at home or in another land.</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Learning a new language isn’t easy. “I thought it just meant learning new words,” says a teenager named Corrina, “but I found out it also involves learning a new culture and a new way of thinking. Learning a language definitely takes time.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>It also takes humility. “You have to learn to laugh at yourself,” says James, a young man who learned Spanish, “because you’ll make lots of mistakes. But that’s part of learning.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> If you can deal with setbacks​—and the occasional embarrassing mistake​—you are more likely to succeed in learning another language.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t despair if others seem to make faster progress than you. The Bible says: “Let each one examine his own actions, and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 6:4</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>What are the rewards?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>The benefits of learning a new language are many. For example, a teenager named Olivia says, “When you learn another language, you widen out and make new friends.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>A teenager named Mary found learning a new language to be a boost to her self-confidence. “It’s difficult for me to be proud of anything I do,” she says, “but now that I’m learning a language, I get excited after learning each new word. It makes me feel better about myself.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Gina, quoted earlier, has found that teaching people the Bible in sign language has added joy to her ministry. “Seeing people’s faces light up when I start communicating with them in their own language is the best reward!” she says.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Learning another language can help you make new friends, boost your self-confidence, and add meaning to your ministry. It’s a vital way to reach “all nations and tribes and peoples and languages” with the good news.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a>, footnote.</p>
