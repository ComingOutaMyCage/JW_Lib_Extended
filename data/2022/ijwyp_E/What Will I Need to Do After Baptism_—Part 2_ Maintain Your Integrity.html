It means living in a way that shows you are keeping the promise you made to Jehovah when you dedicated yourself to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:4-21:5:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:4, 5</a>) How can you walk in integrity after your baptism?</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>What it means:</strong> Realistically, all Christians will face challenges in life.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>What to expect:</strong> Now and then, your circumstances in life will change, and sometimes in ways you don’t like. The Bible says that bad things can happen to anyone—Christians and non-Christians alike.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Since you know that you will have challenges, you can prepare to face them. View challenges as an opportunity to strengthen your faith and to rely more heavily on Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 1:2, 3</a>) In time, you will be able to say from experience, as did the apostle Paul: “For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a>.</p>

Yet, my dedication is precisely what helped me deal with those challenges.”—Karen.</em></p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>What to expect:</strong> After baptism, you will still experience “the desires of the flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:18-61:2:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:18</a>) You may even feel tempted to have sex before you are married.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Make up your mind now—<strong>before</strong> you are tempted—so that you will not let your desires make your decisions for you.
