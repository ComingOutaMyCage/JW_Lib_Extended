<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Shyness can make you dread the very idea of talking to people face-to-face. As a result, you might feel isolated from others, as if you were alone in a dark room. That can be scary. But if you turn the light on your fears, you might see that they are unfounded. Consider three examples.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>  Fear #1:</strong> “I don’t know what to talk about.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> People remember less of what you say but more of how you make them feel. You can take control of your fear by developing your skill at listening, being genuinely interested in what others have to say.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> What kind of friend do <em>you</em> prefer—a chatterbox who always has something to say or someone who is a good listener?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>  Fear #2:</strong> “People will think I’m boring.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> People will form opinions about you whether you are shy or not. You can take control of your fear—and help people form a <em>better</em> opinion of you—if you let them see you for who you are.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> If you think everyone is judging you negatively, could you be judging them unfairly by assuming the worst?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>  Fear #3:</strong> “I’ll be embarrassed if I say the wrong thing.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> At times, that happens to everyone. You can take control of your fear by viewing blunders as an opportunity to show that you don’t take yourself too seriously.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Don’t you enjoy being with people who can admit that they are not perfect?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> Some people think they are not shy because they text a lot. But genuine friendships are easier to form with people when you have in-person conversation. Psychologist and technology expert Sherry Turkle writes: “It is when we see each other’s faces and hear each other’s voices that we become most human to each other.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>  Avoid comparisons.</strong> You don’t have to become an extrovert. Instead, your goal can be to bring your shyness under control so that you don’t miss out on rewarding friendships and experiences.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>“Conversations don’t have to be long and drawn out, and you don’t have to be the life of the party. Just introduce yourself to someone new, or ask a few simple questions.”—Alicia.</em></p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>Bible principle: “Let each one examine his own actions, and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 6:4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  <strong>Be observant.</strong> Watch sociable people and notice how they converse with others. What works for them? What doesn’t work so well? Which desirable skills of theirs could <em>you</em> develop?</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>Bible principle: “As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens his friend.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:17-20:27:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:17</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>  <strong>Ask questions.</strong> People usually like to give their viewpoint on things, so asking questions is a good way to start a conversation with them. It also puts less attention on you.</p>
