<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>For many people, the grieving process is intense and doesn’t end quickly.</p>
<blockquote class="borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“Not a day goes by that I don’t think about my grandpa. Although it’s been two years since he died, I still have a hard time talking about him without crying.”—Olivia.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><em>“My grandmother was a huge supporter of my goals, but she didn’t live to see me reach any of them. Grief hits me with each milestone in my life that she misses.”—Alison.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The grieving process can cause you to feel a wide range of emotions. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“When my uncle died, I was in <strong>shock,</strong> and I stayed in shock for a long time. That was the first time someone close to me had died, and it hit me like a freight train.”—Nadine.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>“I felt some <strong>anger</strong> toward my grandfather when he died, because he didn’t take care of his health, even though we urged him to.”—Carlos.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><em>“My sister and I were the only close family members who weren’t present when my grandfather died. Afterward, I felt <strong>guilt</strong> because I felt I had not given him a proper goodbye.”—Adriana.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>“A married couple whom our family was close to died in a car accident. Afterward, anytime a family member left the house, I felt <strong>fear,</strong> thinking that he or she might die too.”—Jared.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><em>“When my grandmother died three years ago, I <strong>regretted</strong></em><strong></strong> not having <em>spent more time with her while she was alive.”—Julianna.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Shock, anger, guilt, fear, and regret are normal aspects of grieving. If you have any of those feelings, be assured that eventually they will become less intense. In the meantime, how can you cope with your grief?</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Confide in a friend.</strong> The Bible says that a true friend is “born for times of distress.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>) Talking to someone about how you feel can help you to get the support you need.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><em>“It’s normal to grieve. Sometimes you can do it alone, but then you can get stuck in a cloud of gloom. That’s why it’s good to talk to someone.”—Yvette.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Remember your loved one.</strong> The Bible says that “a good person has good things saved in his heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:45-42:6:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 6:45</a>, <em>Easy-to-Read Version,</em> 1992) You could write about your fond memories or create a scrapbook.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><em>“I decided to write out all the things that my friend taught me before his death, and in that way his example lived on. Writing it down helped me to cope with the loss.”—Jeffrey.</em></p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>Take care of your health.</strong> The Bible acknowledges the benefits of physical activity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:8</a>) Make sure you are getting the nutrition, exercise, and rest you need.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>Express your feelings in prayer.</strong> The Bible calls Jehovah God the “Hearer of prayer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2</a>) It also says that Jehovah “heals the brokenhearted; he binds up their wounds.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:3-19:147:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 147:3</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Have reasonable expectations.</strong> Remember that each person grieves in his or her own way. The Bible says that Jacob “kept refusing to take comfort” when he thought that his son had died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:35-1:37:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 37:35</a>) So don’t be surprised if your grief lingers.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><em>“I find that random sights can trigger memories of my great-aunt, even though it’s been 15 years since she passed away.”—Taylor.</em></p>
