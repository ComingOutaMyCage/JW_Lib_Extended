<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:1-20:22:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:1</a>, the Bible says that “a good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth.” So it’s OK to want a good reputation—even to want others to like you.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>But sometimes a desire for acceptance turns into a craving for popularity. Could there be a danger? Onya, 16, would say yes:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><em>“I’ve seen people do crazy things—like jump off a second-story ledge at my school—just to become popular.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>To get the attention of their peers, some people even film their foolish stunts and post them online. For example, a number of teenagers uploaded videos of themselves eating laundry detergent pods—small capsules that contain toxic substances—something that no one should ever do!</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Don’t do anything from . . . a cheap desire to boast.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 2:3</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>
