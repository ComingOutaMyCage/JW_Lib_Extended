<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>According to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, about half of all interview respondents from age 15 to 19 have engaged in oral sex. “If you talk to teens [about oral sex] they’ll tell you it’s not a big deal,” says Sharlene Azam, the author of the book <em>Oral Sex Is the New Goodnight Kiss.</em> “In fact, they don’t consider it sex.”</p>

<h2 id="p26" data-pid="26"><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>Consider several scriptures in the Bible that relate to the topic of oral sex.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “This is the will of God, that you should . . . abstain from sexual immorality.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:3-52:4:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:​3</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>The original-​language word translated “sexual immorality” refers to <em>all</em> forms of intimate conduct outside of marriage, including intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, and masturbating another person. A person who engages in sexual immorality can reap serious consequences, the most tragic of which is a damaged friendship with God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:12-60:3:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>Oral sex can have harmful physical and spiritual consequences. It can also take an emotional toll. “Feeling used, regretful, or vulnerable is not unique to vaginal sex,” says the book <em>Talking Sex With Your Kids.</em> “All of the bad emotions someone might experience from having intercourse in the wrong situation can be experienced from having <em>any</em> type of sex in the wrong situation. Sex is sex.”</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:​17</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>Do you believe that God’s laws regarding sex really benefit you? Or do you think that they restrict you? To help you answer those questions, think of a busy highway with posted speed limits, traffic signals, and stop signs. Do you view those signs and signals as a restriction or as a protection? What would happen if you​—and other drivers​—ignored them?</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35">Traffic laws restrict your freedom, but they protect you. Similarly, God’s laws place restrictions on you, but they safeguard you</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>It is similar with God’s standards. If you ignore them, you are sure to reap what you sow. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) “The more you abandon your beliefs and values and engage in activities you don’t feel right about, the less you’ll respect yourself,” says the book <em>Sex Smart.</em> In contrast, if you live in accord with God’s standards, you will show true moral character. More than that, you will maintain a clean conscience.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:16-60:3:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:16</a>.</p>
