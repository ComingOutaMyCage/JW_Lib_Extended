Although the road is not mentioned directly in the Bible, it was likely the highway that Paul used on his trek to Rome. The earliest portion of this road was built in 312 B.C.E. Construction continued, however, and by about 244 B.C.E., the Appian Way stretched from Rome to Brundisium. (See map.) Brothers from Rome traveled southward to Three Taverns and the Marketplace of Appius, both located along the Appian Way, to meet Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:15-44:28:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 28:15</a>) The Marketplace of Appius was about 65 km (40 mi) from Rome. Three Taverns was about 50 km (30 mi) from Rome.</p>
