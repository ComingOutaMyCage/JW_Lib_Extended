<p id="p4" data-pid="4">REASON(S): Paul here quotes the first part of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:1</a>. In the original Hebrew text, the divine name appears in the second part of the verse, in the expression “the arm of Jehovah.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:38-43:12:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 12:38</a>, John quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:1</a> in its entirety. Both John and Paul apparently quote from the <em>Septuagint</em> translation of Isaiah’s prophecy, where the Greek text begins with the form of the word <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) used for direct address. The translators of the <em>Septuagint</em> may have inserted the divine name in this first occurrence in order to clarify to the reader that the prophet addresses his questions to God. As previously noted, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> in later copies of the <em>Septuagint</em> is often used as a substitute for the Tetragrammaton in the original Hebrew text (as is the case in the expression “arm of Jehovah” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:1</a>). Therefore, the divine name has here been used in the main text.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13">REASON(S): Available Greek manuscripts read “for the Lord” (<em>toi Ky·riʹoi</em>) here, but there are good reasons for using the divine name in the main text. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> can refer to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Romans 12:1, 2</a>, Paul urges his readers to present their bodies as a sacrifice “to <em>God”</em> and to make sure of what is “the good and acceptable and perfect will of <em>God.”</em> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Verse 3</a> goes on to say “as <em>God</em> has given to [each one] a measure of faith.” Additionally, the closest other occurrence of <em>Kyʹri·os</em> in this context is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:19-45:12:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 12:19</a>, which quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:35-5:32:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, where the context shows that Jehovah is speaking. (See comment on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:19-45:12:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 12:19</a>.) Also, scholars have noted that the Greek verb <em>dou·leuʹo,</em> “to slave for”; “to serve,” is used in the <em>Septuagint</em> to render Hebrew expressions where the Tetragrammaton is used in the Hebrew text. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:7-7:2:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Judges 2:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:7:4-9:7:4" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 7:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:20-9:12:20" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 12:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:8-14:30:8" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 30:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:11-19:2:11" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> Psalm 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:2-19:100:2" data-bid="16-6" class="b"> 100:2</a> [99:2, <em>LXX</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:102:22-19:102:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b">102:22</a> [101:22, <em>LXX</em>]) Therefore, both the context and the Hebrew Scripture background of this expression point to the fact that “the Lord” referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 12:11</a> is, not Jesus, but Jehovah God.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18">REASON(S): Available Greek manuscripts here read “says Lord” (<em>leʹgei Kyʹri·os</em>), but the divine name is used in the main text for the following reasons: Paul is quoting from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:35-5:32:35" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>. In that verse, the phrase “says Jehovah” does not appear in the original Hebrew text, but the context makes it clear that the words Paul quotes were spoken by Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:19-5:32:34" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:19-34</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/1:22$p/E:1001070601/45-45:230">study note on Matthew 1:22</a>.) Paul obviously adds this phrase to identify the speaker. In later copies of the <em>Septuagint,</em> the term <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) is often used as a substitute for the divine name in the original Hebrew text, as is the case in the many passages quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures. It is also worth noting that in this verse, the Greek definite article is not used before <em>Kyʹri·os,</em> where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage, making <em>Kyʹri·os</em> tantamount to a proper name. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:30-58:10:30" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:30</a>, Paul uses the same quotation from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:35-5:32:35" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> and then quotes words from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:36-5:32:36" data-bid="26-1" class="b">verse 36</a> (“Jehovah will judge his people”), where the divine name is used.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26">REASON(S): Available Greek manuscripts use the term “the Lord” (<em>ho Kyʹri·os</em>); other manuscripts use “the God” (<em>ho The·osʹ</em>). And some ancient translations into other languages use an equivalent for “God.” In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the title Lord often refers to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. In this case, the context (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:1-45:14:12" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Romans 14:1-12</a>) clearly points to Jehovah God as the Lord referred to. Paul discusses the importance of not judging one another in matters of conscience. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:3-45:14:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Verse 3</a> states that <em>“God</em> has welcomed” both “the one eating” and “the one not eating.” Paul continues to discuss this subject, and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:10-45:14:10" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Romans 14:10</a>, he mentions that each one will “stand before the judgment seat of <em>God.”</em> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Romans 14:12</a>, Paul concludes by saying that each one “will render an account for himself to <em>God.”</em> Thus, the verses surrounding <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:4-45:14:4" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Romans 14:4</a> indicate that Jehovah is “the Lord” spoken of here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:4-45:14:4" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Romans 14:4</a>. Another reason for coming to this conclusion is the Hebrew Scripture background. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:11-45:14:11" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Romans 14:11</a>, Paul quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:23-23:45:23" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:23</a>, the context of which shows Jehovah <em>God</em> as the one speaking. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:22" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18-22</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/14:11$p/E:1001070731/12-12:620">study note on Romans 14:11</a>.) In view of the factors pointing to the conclusion that <em>ho Kyʹri·os</em> here refers to Jehovah God, the divine name is used in the main text. Also, some translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew and other languages use the divine name here.</p>

From the beginning of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:1-45:14:23" data-bid="46-1" class="b">chapter 14</a>, Paul discusses the importance of not judging one another. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:3-45:14:3" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Romans 14:3</a>, he points out that <em>“God</em> has welcomed” both “the one eating” and “the one not eating.” Then, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:4-45:14:4" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Romans 14:4</a>, he mentions that a servant “stands or falls” to “his own <em>master”</em> and that the Lord “Jehovah can make him stand.” (See comment on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:4-45:14:4" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Romans 14:4</a>.) Continuing along this line of reasoning, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:10-45:14:10" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Romans 14:10</a> states that each one will “stand before the judgment seat of <em>God.”</em> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:11-45:14:11" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Romans 14:11</a>, Paul quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:23-23:45:23" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:23</a>, where the context makes it clear that Jehovah is the one speaking.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46">REASON(S): Available Greek manuscripts use the term <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (“Lord,” preceded by the definite article in Greek) three times in this verse. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, this title is often used to refer to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. The identity of <em>Kyʹri·os</em> in this verse is related to the identity of <em>Kyʹri·os</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:4-45:14:4" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Romans 14:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:6-45:14:6" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 6</a>. The reasons for concluding that <em>Kyʹri·os</em> in those verses refers to Jehovah God are discussed in the comments on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:4-45:14:4" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Romans 14:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:6-45:14:6" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 6</a>. Additionally, the concepts of living to, dying to, and belonging to <em>God</em> agree with what the Bible teaches elsewhere. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:3-19:100:3" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Psalm 100:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:2-19:146:2" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 146:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:11-45:6:11" data-bid="68-3" class="b"> Romans 6:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:19-48:2:19" data-bid="68-4" class="b"> Galatians 2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:2-60:4:2" data-bid="68-5" class="b"> 1 Peter 4:2</a>) So although Greek manuscripts use <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (preceded by the definite article in Greek), the ambiguity of the term, the context, and the Scriptures as a whole support the use of the divine name in this verse.</p>
