Though the building underwent renovation and alteration, the original structure is thought to have been built as a synagogue in the latter half of the first century C.E. The presence of the synagogue indicates that Jews lived in the vicinity of Rome for a long time. Although the Jews were expelled from the city of Rome by Emperor Claudius about the year 49 or 50 C.E., it is possible that Jewish communities remained in the area. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:1-44:18:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 18:1, 2</a>) After the death of Claudius in 54 C.E., many Jews returned to the city of Rome. When Paul wrote his letter to the Christians in Rome, about the year 56 C.E., the congregation was composed of Jews as well as Gentiles. This explains why Paul addressed matters related to both groups, helping them to see how they could live together in unity.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:15-45:1:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ro 1:15, 16</a>.</p>
