<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Caesar:</strong> Or “Emperor.” The Greek word <em>Kaiʹsar</em> corresponds to the Latin term <em>Caesar.</em> (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="71" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077045/">Glossary</a>.) The name <strong>Augustus,</strong> a Latin word meaning “August One,” was first given by the Roman Senate as a title to Gaius Octavius, the first Roman emperor, in the year 27 B.C.E. He thus became known as <strong>Caesar Augustus.</strong> His <strong>decree</strong> resulted in Jesus’ being born in Bethlehem, in fulfillment of Bible prophecy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:20-27:11:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Da 11:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mic 5:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>the inhabited earth:</strong> In a broad sense, the Greek word for “inhabited earth” (<em>oi·kou·meʹne</em>) refers to the earth as the dwelling place of mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:5-42:4:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:31-44:17:31" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ac 17:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:18-45:10:18" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Ro 10:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Re 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 16:14</a>) In the first century, this term was also used in reference to the vast Roman Empire, where the Jews had been dispersed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:5-44:24:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ac 24:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>to be registered:</strong> Augustus likely issued this decree because a census would help him to tax his subjects and conscript men for military service. In doing so, Augustus evidently fulfilled Daniel’s prophecy about a ruler “who causes an exactor to pass through the splendid kingdom.” Daniel further foretold that during the reign of that ruler’s successor, “a despised one,” something momentous would happen: “The Leader of the covenant,” or the Messiah, would be “broken,” or put to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:20-27:11:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Da 11:20-22</a>) Jesus was executed during the reign of Augustus’ successor, Tiberius.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>Quirinius . . . governor of Syria:</strong> Publius Sulpicius Quirinius, a distinguished Roman senator, is mentioned only once in the Bible. Scholars initially claimed that Quirinius served only one term of governorship over the Roman province of Syria in about 6 C.E., during which a rebellion broke out in response to a census. As a result, they attacked this passage and cast doubt on Luke’s account by reasoning that Quirinius was governor in 6 or 7 C.E., whereas Jesus’ birth was earlier. However, in 1764 an inscription was found that strongly suggests that Quirinius served as governor (or, legate) in Syria for two distinct terms. Other inscriptions too have led some historians to acknowledge that Quirinius served a term as governor of Syria earlier, in the B.C.E. period. It was evidently during this term that the <strong>first registration,</strong> mentioned in this verse, took place. Furthermore, the critics’ reasoning ignores three key facts. First, Luke acknowledges that there was more than one census, calling this the <em>“first</em> registration.” He was evidently aware of a later registration, which occurred about 6 C.E. That registration was mentioned by Luke in the book of Acts (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:37-44:5:37" data-bid="7-1" class="b">5:37</a>) and by Josephus. Second, Bible chronology rules out the possibility that Jesus was born during Quirinius’ second term. However, it does harmonize with Jesus’ being born during Quirinius’ first term, which was somewhere between the years 4 and 1 B.C.E. Third, Luke is well-known as a meticulous historian, one who lived in the era of many of the events he described. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:3-42:1:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lu 1:3</a>) In addition, he was inspired by holy spirit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2Ti 3:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>went up from Galilee:</strong> There was a town named Bethlehem just 11 km (7 mi) from Nazareth, but prophecy specified that the Messiah would come from “Bethlehem Ephrathah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mic 5:2</a>) That <strong>Bethlehem,</strong> referred to as <strong>David’s city,</strong> was located in <strong>Judea,</strong> in the south. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:1-9:16:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1Sa 16:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:11-9:16:11" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:13-9:16:13" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 13</a>) The direct distance (as the crow flies) from Nazareth to Bethlehem Ephrathah is about 110 km (69 mi). The actual travel distance through Samaria (based on present-day roads) may have been up to 150 km (93 mi). The route passes through hilly country, and the journey would have been an arduous one, taking several days.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>the firstborn:</strong> This expression implies that Mary later had other children.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:55-40:13:56" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mt 13:55, 56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:3-41:6:3" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Mr 6:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>manger:</strong> The Greek word <em>phatʹne,</em> rendered “manger,” means “feeding place.” It may have been some kind of feeding trough for animals, though the Greek word <em>phatʹne</em> can also refer to the stall in which animals are kept. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:15-42:13:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lu 13:15</a>, where this Greek word is rendered “stall.”) In this context, it appears to refer to a feeding place, though the Bible does not specify whether this manger was an outdoor or an indoor trough or one connected with a stall.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>lodging place:</strong> The Greek word could also be rendered “guest room,” as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:14-41:14:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mr 14:14</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:11-42:22:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Lu 22:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>shepherds:</strong> A large number of sheep were regularly needed for offerings at Jerusalem’s temple, so it is quite possible that some of the sheep raised around Bethlehem were intended for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>living out of doors:</strong> The Greek expression comes from a verb that combines <em>a·grosʹ</em> (“field”) and <em>au·leʹ</em> (“place open to the air”), so the word means “to live in the fields, to live under the open sky,” and implies spending the night outdoors. Sheep may be led out to pasture during the daytime in any season of the year. However, the shepherds were spending the night out in the fields with their flocks. So this indicates the time of Jesus’ birth. The rainy season in Israel begins about mid-October and lasts several months. By December, Bethlehem, like Jerusalem, frequently experiences frost at night. The fact that Bethlehem’s shepherds were in the fields at night points to a season prior to the start of the rains.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070237/">App. B15</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah’s glory:</strong> The first two chapters of Luke’s account are rich with references to and allusions to passages and expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures where the divine name occurs. In the Hebrew Scriptures, the corresponding Hebrew expression for “glory” occurs along with the Tetragrammaton more than 30 times. Some examples are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:7-2:16:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ex 16:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:34-2:40:34" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 40:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:9:6-3:9:6" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Le 9:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:9:23-3:9:23" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:10-4:14:10" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Nu 14:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:19-4:16:19" data-bid="20-6" class="b"> 16:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:6-4:20:6" data-bid="20-7" class="b"> 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:11-11:8:11" data-bid="20-8" class="b"> 1Ki 8:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:5:14-14:5:14" data-bid="20-9" class="b"> 2Ch 5:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:7:1-14:7:1" data-bid="20-10" class="b"> 7:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:31-19:104:31" data-bid="20-11" class="b"> Ps 104:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:138:5-19:138:5" data-bid="20-12" class="b"> 138:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:2-23:35:2" data-bid="20-13" class="b"> Isa 35:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:5-23:40:5" data-bid="20-14" class="b"> 40:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:1-23:60:1" data-bid="20-15" class="b"> 60:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:28-26:1:28" data-bid="20-16" class="b"> Eze 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:12-26:3:12" data-bid="20-17" class="b"> 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:10:4-26:10:4" data-bid="20-18" class="b"> 10:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:43:4-26:43:4" data-bid="20-19" class="b"> 43:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:14-35:2:14" data-bid="20-20" class="b"> Hab 2:14</a>.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/1:6$p/E:1001070645/21-21:772">study notes on Lu 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/1:9$p/E:1001070645/25-25:686"> 1:9</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">App. C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079342/146-154">Lu 2:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>who is Christ:</strong> The angel’s use of this title was evidently prophetic, since the outpouring of holy spirit at the time of Jesus’ baptism marked the time of his becoming in actual fact the Messiah, or Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mt 3:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:9-41:1:11" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Mr 1:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:21-42:3:22" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Lu 3:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>Christ the Lord:</strong> The Greek expression here rendered “Christ the Lord” (<em>khri·stosʹ kyʹri·os,</em> lit., “Christ Lord”) occurs only here in the Christian Greek Scriptures. The angel’s use of these titles was evidently prophetic, and the clause could therefore be rendered “who <em>is to be</em> Christ the Lord.” (See study note on <strong>who is Christ</strong> in this verse.) Under inspiration, Peter explains at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:36-44:2:36" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ac 2:36</a> that God had made Jesus “both Lord and Christ.” However, the expression rendered “Christ the Lord” has also been understood in other ways. Some scholars have suggested the rendering “the anointed Lord.” Others have considered this combination of titles to mean “the Lord’s Christ,” which is the reading found in a few Latin and Syriac translations of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:11-42:2:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Lu 2:11</a>. Along these lines, some translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew (referred to as J<sup>5-8, 10</sup> in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070244/">App. C</a>) use the rendering <em>ma·shiʹach Yeho·wahʹ,</em> that is, “Jehovah’s Christ.” For these and other reasons, some have understood the term at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:11-42:2:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Lu 2:11</a> in a way similar to the Greek expression rendered “the Christ of Jehovah” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:26-42:2:26" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Lu 2:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:14-42:2:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>2:14</strong></a></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>and on earth peace among men of goodwill:</strong> Some manuscripts have readings that could be rendered “and on earth peace, goodwill toward men,” and this wording is reflected in some Bible translations. But the reading employed by the <em>New World Translation</em> has much stronger manuscript support. This angelic announcement did not refer to an expression of God’s goodwill toward all humans regardless of their attitudes and actions. Rather, it refers to those who will receive his goodwill because they display genuine faith in him and become followers of his Son.​—See study note on <strong>men of goodwill</strong> in this verse.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>men of goodwill:</strong> The “goodwill” referred to in this angelic statement is evidently that displayed by God, not by humans. The Greek word <em>eu·do·kiʹa</em> can also be rendered “favor; good pleasure; approval.” The related verb <em>eu·do·keʹo</em> is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:17-40:3:17" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Mt 3:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:11-41:1:11" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Mr 1:11</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:22-42:3:22" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Lu 3:22</a> (see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:17$p/E:1001070603/50-50:365">study notes on Mt 3:17;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/1:11$p/E:1001070629/46-46:369"> Mr 1:11</a>), where God addresses his Son right after his baptism. It conveys the basic meaning, “to approve; to be well-pleased with; to regard favorably; to take delight in.” In line with this usage, the expression “men of goodwill” (<em>an·throʹpois eu·do·kiʹas</em>) refers to people who have God’s approval and goodwill, and it could also be rendered “people whom he approves; people with whom he is well-pleased.” So this angelic statement was referring to God’s goodwill, not toward men in general, but toward those who would please him by their genuine faith in him and by becoming followers of his Son. Although the Greek word <em>eu·do·kiʹa</em> in some contexts can refer to the goodwill of humans (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:1-45:10:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ro 10:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:15-50:1:15" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Php 1:15</a>), it is frequently used with regard to God’s goodwill, or good pleasure, or to the way approved by him (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:26-40:11:26" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mt 11:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:21-42:10:21" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Lu 10:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:5-49:1:5" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Eph 1:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:9-49:1:9" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:13-50:2:13" data-bid="31-5" class="b"> Php 2:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:11-53:1:11" data-bid="31-6" class="b"> 2Th 1:11</a>). In the <em>Septuagint</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:18-19:51:18" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps 51:18</a> (50:20, <em>LXX</em>), the word is used about the “goodwill” of God.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>which Jehovah has made known to us:</strong> The angels conveyed the message, but the shepherds recognized the source as being Jehovah God. In the <em>Septuagint,</em> the Greek verb rendered “has made known” is used to translate a corresponding Hebrew verb in contexts where Jehovah communicates his will to humans or where humans want to know his will. In such scriptures, the original Hebrew text often uses the Tetragrammaton. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:4-19:25:4" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps 25:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:39:4-19:39:4" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 39:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:98:2-19:98:2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 98:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:6-19:103:7" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 103:6, 7</a>) Therefore, it would be natural to connect the divine name with what the Jewish shepherds are here saying.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/1:6$p/E:1001070645/21-21:772">study note on Lu 1:6</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079342/155-162">Lu 2:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>the time . . . for purifying them:</strong> That is, the time for them to be ceremonially cleansed for worship. The Mosaic Law required that a mother undergo purification for 40 days after giving birth to a male. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:12:1-3:12:4" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Le 12:1-4</a>) This law evidently taught, not a demeaning view of women and childbirth, but a vital spiritual truth: Through the process of childbirth, the sin of Adam is transmitted from one generation to the next. Mary was no exception, contrary to claims made by religious scholars. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ro 5:12</a>) Luke would not have used the pronoun “them” in this verse to include Jesus, for he knew that holy spirit had shielded Jesus from the sinful condition of his imperfect human mother, so he did not need cleansing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:34-42:1:35" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Lu 1:34, 35</a>) Because Joseph arranged for the trip and as family head was responsible for seeing that the sacrifice was offered, Luke may have included Jesus’ adoptive father in the word “them.”</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah’s Law:</strong> The expression “Jehovah’s Law,” as well as “the Law of Jehovah,” occurs many times in the Hebrew Scriptures as a combination of the Hebrew word for “law” and the Tetragrammaton.

As the firstborn son, Jesus was sanctified to God and belonged to him. For this reason, the Law required that Jesus be redeemed by his parents, Joseph and Mary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:1-2:13:2" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ex 13:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:15-4:18:16" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> Nu 18:15, 16</a>) The payment was to be made when the child was “a month old <em>and up.”</em> So Joseph would have been allowed to pay the five shekels at the same time that Mary made her purification offering, that is, 40 days after Jesus’ birth.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="s5"><strong>the Christ:</strong> Or “the Anointed One; the Messiah.” The title “Christ” is derived from the Greek word <em>Khri·stosʹ</em> and is equivalent to the title “Messiah” (from Hebrew <em>ma·shiʹach</em>), both meaning “Anointed One.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/1:1$p/E:1001070601/9-9:215">study note on Mt 1:1</a> and on <strong>the Christ of Jehovah</strong> in this verse.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="s5"><strong>the Christ of Jehovah:</strong> There are good reasons for using the divine name in the main text, although available Greek manuscripts literally read “the Christ of Lord” (<em>ton khri·stonʹ Ky·riʹou</em>). In existing copies of the <em>Septuagint,</em> this expression corresponds to the Hebrew term <em>ma·shiʹach YHWH,</em> that is, “anointed (one) of Jehovah,” used 11 times in the Hebrew Scriptures.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:24:6-9:24:6" data-bid="56-1" class="b">1Sa 24:6</a> (twice), <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:24:10-9:24:10" data-bid="57-1" class="b">10;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:26:9-9:26:9" data-bid="58-1" class="b">26:9,</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:26:11-9:26:11" data-bid="59-1" class="b">11,</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:26:16-9:26:16" data-bid="60-1" class="b">16,</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:26:23-9:26:23" data-bid="61-1" class="b">23;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:1:14-10:1:14" data-bid="62-1" class="b">2Sa 1:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:1:16-10:1:16" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:21-10:19:21" data-bid="62-3" class="b"> 19:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:4:20-25:4:20" data-bid="62-4" class="b"> La 4:20</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">App. C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079342/185-193">Lu 2:26</a>.</p>

Other translations have used such terms as “Lord,” “Master,” “Sovereign,” or “Ruler of all.” Many translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew use the Hebrew term <em>ʼAdho·naiʹ</em> (Sovereign Lord), but at least two such translations (referred to as J<sup>9, 18</sup> in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070244/">App. C</a>) here use the divine name, Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="s5"><strong>letting your slave go:</strong> The Greek word for “to let go” literally means “to set free; to release; to dismiss.” Here it is used as a euphemism for “to let die.” For a person to die <strong>in peace</strong> could mean his dying a tranquil death after having enjoyed a full life or after the realization of a cherished hope. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:15-1:15:15" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ge 15:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:6-11:2:6" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 1Ki 2:6</a>.)

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:35-42:2:35" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Lu 2:35</a>) To unbelievers, Jesus would be <strong>a sign to be spoken against,</strong> or an object of contempt.

<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="s5"><strong>never missing from the temple:</strong> Anna was constantly at the temple, possibly from the time the temple gates were opened in the morning until they were closed in the evening.

<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="s5"><strong>they went back into Galilee:</strong> Although this statement may seem to indicate that Joseph and Mary went straight to Nazareth after presenting Jesus at the temple, Luke’s account is highly condensed. Matthew’s account (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:1-40:2:23" data-bid="87-1" class="b">2:1-23</a>) provides additional details regarding the visit of the astrologers, Joseph and Mary’s flight to Egypt to escape King Herod’s murderous plan, Herod’s death, and the family’s return to Nazareth.</p>

<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="s5"><strong>asking them questions:</strong> As shown by the reaction of those listening to Jesus, his questions were not merely those of a boy seeking to satisfy his curiosity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:47-42:2:47" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Lu 2:47</a>) The Greek word rendered “asking . . . questions” could in some contexts refer to the type of questioning and counterquestioning used in a judicial examination.

<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="s5"><strong>he said to them:</strong> The words that follow are Jesus’ first words recorded in the Bible. As a young boy, Jesus was evidently not fully aware of his prehuman existence. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:16$p/E:1001070603/44-44:170">study notes on Mt 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/3:21$p/E:1001070647/45-45:551"> Lu 3:21</a>.) Yet, it seems reasonable that his mother and his adoptive father had passed on to him the information received during angelic visitations as well as through the prophecies of Simeon and Anna, spoken during the family’s trip to Jerusalem 40 days after Jesus’ birth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:20-40:1:25" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Mt 1:20-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:13-40:2:14" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 2:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:19-40:2:21" data-bid="96-3" class="b"> 19-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:38" data-bid="96-4" class="b"> Lu 1:26-38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:8-42:2:38" data-bid="96-5" class="b"> 2:8-38</a>) Jesus’ reply indicates that he to some extent understood the miraculous nature of his birth and his special personal relationship with his heavenly Father, Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="s5"><strong>I must be in the house of my Father:</strong> The Greek expression for “in the house of my Father” is literally rendered “in the [things] of my Father.” The context shows that Joseph and Mary were concerned about Jesus’ whereabouts, so it is most natural to understand these words to refer to a location, or place, that is, “the house [or “dwelling; courts”] of my Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:44-42:2:46" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Lu 2:44-46</a>) Later, during his ministry, Jesus specifically referred to the temple as “the house of my Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:16-43:2:16" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Joh 2:16</a>) According to some scholars, though, this expression could also be understood more broadly as, “I need to be concerned [or, “busy”] with the things of my Father.”</p>
