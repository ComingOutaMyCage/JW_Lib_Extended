<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Saul falls to the ground near Damascus, blinded by a flash of light. He hears a voice say: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:3-44:9:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 9:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:6-44:22:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:13-44:26:14" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 26:13, 14</a>) Jesus has interrupted Saul’s plan to arrest Jesus’ disciples in Damascus and take them bound to Jerusalem for trial. Saul’s journey of some 240 km (150 mi) from Jerusalem turns out completely different from what he expected. Jesus’ message transforms Saul (later known by his Roman name, Paul) from a determined persecutor of Christians to one of Christianity’s boldest defenders. Paul’s zealous ministry is described in detail in the book of Acts.</p>
