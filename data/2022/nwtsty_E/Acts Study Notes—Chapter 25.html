<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>the province:</strong> That is, the Roman province of Judea, with Caesarea serving as the governor’s residence. The Greek expression rendered <strong>arriving in . . . and taking charge</strong> is understood to refer to Festus’ taking up his office as governor in the province.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>Caesar:</strong> Or “the Emperor.” The Roman emperor at this time was Nero. His rule began in 54 C.E. and ended in 68 C.E. when he committed suicide at about the age of 31. All references to Caesar in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:1-44:28:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts chapters 25 through 28</a> apply to Nero.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/22:17$p/E:1001070622/15-15:391">study notes on Mt 22:17;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/17:7$p/E:1001070706/10-10:156"> Ac 17:7</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="71" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077045/">Glossary</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>I appeal to Caesar!:</strong> In the Bible record, this is the third time that Paul made use of his rights as a Roman citizen. (For the other two occasions, see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/16:37$p/E:1001070705/47-47:936">study notes on Ac 16:37;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/22:25$p/E:1001070711/25-25:643"> 22:25</a>.) Such an appeal to Caesar could be made either after the pronouncement of judgment or at any earlier point in the trial. Festus gave evidence of not wanting to decide the matter himself, and a trial in Jerusalem held virtually no hope of justice. So Paul made this formal petition to be judged by the highest court of the empire. It appears that in some cases the appeal could be denied, for example, in the case of a thief, a pirate, or a seditionist caught in the act. Likely for this reason, Festus conferred with “the assembly of counselors” before admitting the appeal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:12-44:25:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 25:12</a>) The subsequent hearing with the visiting Herod Agrippa II was held in order that Festus might have clearer information to submit when transmitting Paul’s case to “the August One,” Nero. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:12-44:25:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ac 25:12-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:32-44:26:32" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 26:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:19-44:28:19" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 28:19</a>) Paul’s appeal also served the purpose of taking him to Rome, fulfilling an intention expressed earlier. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:21-44:19:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ac 19:21</a>) Jesus’ prophetic promise to Paul as well as the angelic message that he later received shows divine direction in the matter.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:11-44:23:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ac 23:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:23-44:27:24" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 27:23, 24</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>Agrippa:</strong> That is, Herod Agrippa II.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>Bernice:</strong> The sister of Herod Agrippa II. It was widely rumored that Agrippa carried on an incestuous relationship with her. She later became the mistress of Titus before he became Roman emperor.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>the August One:</strong> A title for the Roman emperor. The Greek word <em>Se·ba·stosʹ</em> means “worthy of reverence; revered; august” and is a translation of the Latin title <em>Augustus.</em> Some translations use such expressions as “His Majesty the Emperor” or “His Imperial Majesty.” In this case, it is the title of Caesar Nero (54-68 C.E.), the fourth in succession from Octavian (Octavius), who first held this title.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/2:1$p/E:1001070646/4-4:414">study note on Lu 2:1</a>.</p>
