<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">Today, the water in the Dead Sea (Salt Sea) is about nine times as salty as the water in the world’s oceans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:3-1:14:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 14:3</a>) Evaporation of the Dead Sea waters produced an ample supply of salt for the Israelites, although this salt was of poor quality because it was contaminated with other minerals. The Israelites may also have acquired salt from the Phoenicians, who, it is said, obtained it from the Mediterranean by means of evaporation. The Bible mentions salt as a seasoning for food. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:6-18:6:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 6:6</a>) Jesus was a master at using illustrations based on things related to the everyday lives of the people, so he used salt to illustrate important spiritual lessons. For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, he told his disciples: “You are the salt of the earth,” having a preserving influence on others, preventing spiritual corruption and moral decay.</p>
