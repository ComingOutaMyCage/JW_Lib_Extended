Although restrained by cloth wrappings, he stands up and walks. His astonished sisters, Martha and Mary, can hardly believe their eyes, but it’s true! Because of this miracle, many onlookers begin to exercise faith in Jesus. While this account gives us a portrait of Jesus’ unselfish love, it also provides a preview of Jesus’ miracles to be performed on a much larger scale in the new world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 5:28</a>) The account of Lazarus’ resurrection appears only in John’s Gospel.</p>
