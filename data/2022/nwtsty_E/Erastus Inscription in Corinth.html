<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Shown here is a paving stone found in a plaza near the theater in Corinth. The inscription refers to an official by the name of Erastus, who is said to have laid the pavement at his own expense. In his letter to the Christians in Rome, written from Corinth, Paul included greetings from “Erastus, the city treasurer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:23-45:16:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ro 16:23</a>) The pavement with the inscription is believed to have existed in the first century C.E., so some scholars suggest that the Erastus in the inscription is the same person referred to by Paul.</p>
