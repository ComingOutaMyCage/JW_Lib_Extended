<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">Two of the replica threshing sledges (1) shown here are turned upside down, exposing the sharp stones that were embedded in the underside of the sledge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:15-23:41:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 41:15</a>) As shown in the second photo (2), a farmer would spread sheaves of grain on a threshing floor, stand on the sledge, and have an animal, such as a bull, pull him across the grain. The hooves of the animal and the sharp stones on the underside of the sledge would cut and break down the grain stalks, releasing the grain. The farmer would then use a winnowing fork, or shovel (3), to throw the threshed grain into the air. The wind would carry off the chaff, leaving the heavier grain to fall to the ground. Threshing is used in the Bible as a fitting symbol of how Jehovah’s enemies will be beaten and cut to pieces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:33-24:51:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer 51:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:12-33:4:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mic 4:12, 13</a>) John the Baptist used threshing to illustrate how the righteous would be separated from the wicked.</p>
