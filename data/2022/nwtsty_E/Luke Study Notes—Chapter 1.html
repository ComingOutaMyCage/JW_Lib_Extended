<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="se"><a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070146/1-1"><strong>Title</strong></a></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Luke:</strong> The Greek form of the name is <em>Lou·kasʹ,</em> from the Latin name <em>Lucas.</em> Luke, the writer of this Gospel and of Acts of Apostles, was a physician and a faithful companion to the apostle Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:14-51:4:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col 4:14</a>; see also “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070046/">Introduction to Luke</a>.”) Because of his Greek name and his style of writing, some have claimed that Luke was not a Jew. Also, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:10-51:4:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col 4:10-14</a>, Paul first speaks of “those circumcised” and later mentions Luke. However, that claim runs contrary to the indication at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:1-45:3:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ro 3:1, 2</a>, which says that the Jews “were entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God.” Therefore, Luke may have been a Greek-speaking Jew with a Greek name.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>According to Luke:</strong> None of the Gospel writers identify themselves as such in their accounts, and titles are evidently not part of the original text. In some manuscripts of Luke’s Gospel, the title appears as <em>Eu·ag·geʹli·on Ka·taʹ Lou·kanʹ</em> (“Good News [or, “Gospel”] According to Luke”), whereas in others a shorter title, <em>Ka·taʹ Lou·kanʹ</em> (“According to Luke”), is used. It is not clear exactly when such titles were added or began to be used. Some suggest the second century C.E., since examples of the longer title have been found in Gospel manuscripts that have been dated to the end of the second century or early third century. According to some scholars, the opening words of Mark’s book (“The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God”) may have been the reason why the term “gospel” (lit., “good news”) came to be used to describe these accounts. The use of such titles along with the name of the writer may have come about for practical reasons, providing a clear means of identification of the books.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:1-42:1:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>1:1</strong></a></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>that are given full credence:</strong> The Greek expression could also be rendered “that are given full credibility.” It highlights that <strong>the facts</strong> had been thoroughly examined. Combining this with the expression <strong>among us</strong> indicates that there was full conviction among Christians that all things connected with Christ had been fulfilled and had proved true and were worthy of being accepted with confidence. Therefore, some translations use such phrases as “that have been fully believed among us.” In other contexts, forms of the same Greek word are rendered “fully convinced” and “with firm conviction.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:21-45:4:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ro 4:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:5-45:14:5" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 14:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:12-51:4:12" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Col 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:2-42:1:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>1:2</strong></a></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>attendants of the message:</strong> Or “servants of the word.” Two translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew (referred to as J<sup>18, 22</sup> in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070244/">App. C</a>) here use the Tetragrammaton and read “servants of Jehovah’s word.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:3-42:1:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>1:3</strong></a></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>traced:</strong> Or “carefully investigated.” Luke was not an eyewitness to the events he recorded. So in addition to being inspired by holy spirit, he evidently based his account on the following sources: (1) Written records available to him as he compiled Jesus’ genealogy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:23-42:3:38" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lu 3:23-38</a>) (2) The inspired account penned by Matthew. (3) Personal interviews with many eyewitnesses (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:2-42:1:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Lu 1:2</a>), such as the surviving disciples and possibly Jesus’ mother, Mary. Nearly 60 percent of the material in Luke’s Gospel is unique to his account.​—See “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070046/">Introduction to Luke</a>.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>in logical order:</strong> Or “in an orderly sequence.” The Greek expression <em>ka·the·xesʹ,</em> rendered “in logical order,” can refer to sequence of time, topic, or logic, but it does not necessarily denote strict chronological order. That Luke did not always record the events in chronological sequence is evident from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:18-42:3:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lu 3:18-21</a>. Therefore, all four Gospel accounts need to be examined to establish the order of events during Jesus’ life and ministry. Luke generally related events in chronological order, but he evidently allowed other factors to influence his systematic presentation of events and topics.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>most excellent:</strong> The Greek word for “most excellent” (<em>kraʹti·stos</em>) is used in an official sense when addressing high officials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:26-44:23:26" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ac 23:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:3-44:24:3" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 24:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:25-44:26:25" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 26:25</a>) Therefore, some scholars feel that this term may indicate that <strong>Theophilus</strong> held a high position before becoming a Christian. Others understand the Greek term to be simply a friendly or polite form of address or an expression of high esteem. Theophilus was evidently a Christian, for he had already been “taught orally” about Jesus Christ and his ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:4-42:1:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Lu 1:4</a>) Luke’s written statement would have served to assure him of the certainty of what he had previously learned by word of mouth. However, there are other views on this matter. Some feel that Theophilus was at first an interested person who later converted, whereas others feel that the name, meaning “Loved by God; Friend of God,” was used as a pseudonym for Christians in general. When addressing Theophilus at the beginning of Acts of Apostles, Luke does not use the expression “most excellent.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:1-44:1:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ac 1:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:5-42:1:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>1:5</strong></a></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>Herod:</strong> Refers to Herod the Great.​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077132/">Glossary</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>Zechariah:</strong> From the Hebrew name meaning “Jehovah Has Remembered.” Some Bible translations use “Zacharias,” reflecting the Greek form of the name.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>the division of Abijah:</strong> Abijah was a priestly descendant of Aaron. In King David’s day, Abijah was recognized as head of one of the paternal houses of Israel. David divided the priesthood into 24 divisions, each to serve at the sanctuary in Jerusalem for a one-week period every six months. The paternal house of Abijah was chosen by lot to head the eighth division. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:3-13:24:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1Ch 24:3-10</a>) “The division of Abijah” did not necessarily have to do with the line of descent of Zechariah but with the priestly division with which Zechariah was assigned to serve.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/1:9$p/E:1001070645/23-23:888">study note on Lu 1:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>Abijah:</strong> From the Hebrew name meaning “My Father Is Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> The Greek name <em>E·lei·saʹbet</em> comes from the Hebrew name <em>ʼE·li·sheʹvaʽ</em> (Elisheba), meaning “My God Is Plenty; God of Plenty.” Elizabeth was <strong>from the daughters of Aaron,</strong> that is, a descendant of Aaron, so John’s parents were both of priestly descent.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:6-42:1:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>1:6</strong></a></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah:</strong> In this translation, this is the first occurrence of the divine name in the Gospel of Luke. Although existing Greek manuscripts use the word <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) here, there are good reasons to believe that the divine name was originally used in this verse and later replaced with the title Lord. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079342/3-15">Lu 1:6</a>.) The first two chapters of Luke’s account are rich with references to and allusions to expressions and passages in the Hebrew Scriptures where the divine name occurs. For example, the phrase <strong>commandments and legal requirements</strong> and similar combinations of legal terms can be found in the Hebrew Scriptures in contexts where the divine name is used or where Jehovah is speaking.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:2-1:26:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ge 26:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:5-1:26:5" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:36:13-4:36:13" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Nu 36:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:40-5:4:40" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> De 4:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:27:10-5:27:10" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> 27:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:23-26:36:23" data-bid="17-6" class="b"> Eze 36:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:27-26:36:27" data-bid="17-7" class="b"> 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:9-42:1:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>1:9</strong></a></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>his turn to offer incense:</strong> High Priest Aaron initially offered the incense on the golden altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:7-2:30:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex 30:7</a>) However, his son Eleazar was given oversight of the incense and other tabernacle items. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:16-4:4:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Nu 4:16</a>) Zechariah, who was an underpriest, is here described as burning the incense, so it appears that handling this service, except on the Day of Atonement, was not restricted to the high priest. The burning of incense may have been considered the most esteemed of the daily services at the temple. It was done after the sacrifice was offered, and during that time, the people would be gathered for prayer outside the sanctuary. According to Rabbinic tradition, lots were drawn for this service but a priest who had previously officiated was not allowed to do so again unless all present had performed the service before. If this is so, a priest might have the honor only once in a lifetime.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>sanctuary:</strong> In this context, the Greek word <em>na·osʹ</em> refers to the central temple building. When it was Zechariah’s “turn to offer incense,” he had to enter the Holy, the first compartment of the sanctuary, where the altar of incense was located.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/27:5$p/E:1001070627/12-12:155">study notes on Mt 27:5;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/27:51$p/E:1001070627/89-89:108"> 27:51</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070231/">App. B11</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>the sanctuary of Jehovah:</strong> As mentioned in the <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/1:6$p/E:1001070645/21-21:772">study note on Lu 1:6</a>, the first two chapters of Luke’s account are rich with references to and allusions to passages and expressions in the Hebrew Scriptures where the divine name occurs. For example, expressions corresponding to the combination “sanctuary [or “temple”] of Jehovah” often include the Tetragrammaton. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:19:20-4:19:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Nu 19:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:16-12:18:16" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2Ki 18:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:4-12:23:4" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 23:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:13-12:24:13" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 24:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:16" data-bid="21-5" class="b"> 2Ch 26:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:27:2-14:27:2" data-bid="21-6" class="b"> 27:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:24:1-24:24:1" data-bid="21-7" class="b"> Jer 24:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:16-26:8:16" data-bid="21-8" class="b"> Eze 8:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:15-37:2:15" data-bid="21-9" class="b"> Hag 2:15</a>) As explained in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a>, there are good reasons to believe that the divine name was originally used in this verse and later replaced with the title Lord. Therefore, the name Jehovah is used in the main text.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">App. C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079342/16-22">Lu 1:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah’s angel:</strong> Starting at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:7-1:16:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ge 16:7</a>, this phrase is often found in the Hebrew Scriptures as a combination of the Hebrew word for “angel” and the Tetragrammaton. When it occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:3:5-38:3:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Zec 3:5, 6</a> in an early copy of the <em>Septuagint,</em> the Greek word <em>agʹge·los</em> (angel; messenger) is followed by the divine name written in Hebrew characters. This fragment, found in a cave in Nahal Hever, Israel, in the Judean Desert, is dated between 50 B.C.E. and 50 C.E. The reasons why the <em>New World Translation</em> uses the expression “Jehovah’s angel” in the main text, although available Greek manuscripts of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:11-42:1:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Lu 1:​11</a> read “Lord’s angel,” are explained in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/">C3</a>.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>in the sight of Jehovah:</strong> The Greek expression <em>e·noʹpi·on Ky·riʹou</em> (lit., “in sight of [before] Lord”) reflects a Hebrew idiom and occurs over 100 times in existing copies of the <em>Septuagint</em> as a translation of Hebrew phrases where the Tetragrammaton is used in the original text. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:11-7:11:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Jg 11:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:10:19-9:10:19" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 1Sa 10:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:3-10:5:3" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 2Sa 5:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:5-10:6:5" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 6:5</a>) The Hebrew Scripture background for this expression is an indication that <em>Kyʹri·os</em> is here used as a substitute for the divine name.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">App. C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079342/29-37">Lu 1:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>holy spirit:</strong> Or “holy active force.”​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="82" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077140/">Holy spirit</a>”; “<a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077302/">Spirit</a>.”</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah:</strong> The angel’s message to Zechariah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:13-42:1:17" data-bid="30-1" class="b">vss. 13-17</a>) strongly reflects language used in the Hebrew Scriptures. For example, the combination of <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) and <em>The·osʹ</em> (God) along with a personal pronoun (here rendered <strong>Jehovah their God)</strong> is common in quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. (Compare the expression “Jehovah your God” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:8-42:4:8" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Lu 4:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:12-42:4:12" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:27-42:10:27" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 10:27</a>.) In the Hebrew Scriptures, the combination “Jehovah their God” occurs over 30 times, whereas the expression “the Lord their God” is never used. Also, the term <strong>the sons of Israel</strong> reflects a Hebrew idiom used many times in the Hebrew Scriptures, meaning “the people of Israel” or “the Israelites.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:31-1:36:31" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ge 36:31</a>; ftn.; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">App. C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079342/38-46">Lu 1:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="s5"><strong>to turn back the hearts of fathers to children:</strong> This expression, quoting a prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:4:6-39:4:6" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Mal 4:6</a>, is not foretelling a general reconciliation between fathers and their children. Rather, John’s message would move fathers to repent, changing their hard hearts into humble, teachable hearts, like those of obedient children. Some would become children of God. Malachi similarly foretold that the hearts of sons would turn back to fathers, meaning that repentant men would become more like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, their faithful forefathers.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="s5"><strong>holy service:</strong> Or “public service.” The Greek word <em>lei·tour·giʹa</em> used here and the related words <em>lei·tour·geʹo</em> (to render public service) and <em>lei·tour·gosʹ</em> (public servant, or worker) were used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to refer to work or service for the State or for civil authorities and done for the benefit of the people. For example, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:6-45:13:6" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ro 13:6</a>, the secular authorities are called God’s “public servants” (plural form of <em>lei·tour·gosʹ</em>) in the sense that they provide beneficial services for the people. The term as used here by Luke reflects the usage found in the <em>Septuagint,</em> where the verb and noun forms of this expression frequently refer to the temple service of the priests and Levites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:35-2:28:35" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ex 28:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:8:22-4:8:22" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> Nu 8:22</a>) Service performed at the temple included the idea of a public service for the benefit of the people. However, it also included holiness, since the Levitical priests taught God’s Law and offered sacrifices that covered the sins of the people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:3-14:15:3" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Ch 15:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:7-39:2:7" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Mal 2:7</a>.</p>
