<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>the collection:</strong> The Greek word <em>lo·giʹa,</em> rendered “collection,” occurs only twice in the Bible, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:1-46:16:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Co 16:1, 2</a>. The context and Paul’s choice of words indicate that the collection likely involved money, not food or clothing. In saying <em>“the</em> collection,” he suggests that this was a special collection, one already known to the Corinthians. It appears that this collection was taken especially in behalf of the Judean Christians, who were hard-pressed at the time.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:3-46:16:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Co 16:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:10-48:2:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ga 2:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>the first day of every week:</strong> Paul here probably refers to the day following the Jewish Sabbath. He thus recommended that each Christian in Corinth make it a priority, starting early in the week, to set something aside to donate to those in need. Each Christian would offer his donation privately and according to his own means. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:1-46:16:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Co 16:1</a>) Paul was not, as some have suggested, setting up Sunday as the new Sabbath day for Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:16-51:2:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col 2:16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>I will send the men . . . to take your kind gift to Jerusalem:</strong> About 55 C.E., the Christians in Judea had fallen into poverty, so Paul supervised the collection of relief funds from the congregations in Galatia, Macedonia, and Achaia. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:1-46:16:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Co 16:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:1-47:8:1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2Co 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:4-47:8:4" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:1-47:9:2" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 9:1, 2</a>) When he set out on the long journey to Jerusalem in 56 C.E. to deliver the contribution, Paul was accompanied by a number of men. The group were carrying money entrusted to them by several congregations, each of which may have supplied men to accompany Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:3-44:20:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ac 20:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:25-45:15:26" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ro 15:25, 26</a>) Such a large company may have been needed for security because robbers posed a threat to safe passage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:26-47:11:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2Co 11:26</a>) Since only approved men would be delivering the collected funds along with Paul, there would not be any reason to suspect these men of misusing the funds. Those giving the contributions could be confident that the money would be used properly.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:20-47:8:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2Co 8:20</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>if Jehovah permits:</strong> This expression and similar ones used in the Christian Greek Scriptures emphasize the need to take God’s will into account when doing or planning to do something.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:3-58:6:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Heb 6:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:15-59:4:15" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Jas 4:15</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/4:19$p/E:1001070737/25-25:542">study note on 1Co 4:19</a>; for the use of the divine name in this phrase, see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">App. C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079346/61-66">1Co 16:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>I am remaining in Ephesus:</strong> These words of Paul offer strong proof that he wrote this letter while in Ephesus. Indirect evidence supporting the same conclusion is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:19-46:16:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Co 16:19</a>, where Paul adds to his own greetings those of Aquila and Prisca (Priscilla). According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:18-44:18:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ac 18:18, 19</a>, that couple had moved from Corinth to Ephesus.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>the Festival of Pentecost:</strong> See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="127" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077222/">Pentecost</a>,” and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070237/">App. B15</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>a large door that leads to activity:</strong> This is one of three instances in which Paul uses the term “door” in a figurative sense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:12-47:2:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2Co 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:3-51:4:3" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Col 4:3</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/14:27$p/E:1001070703/22-22:412">study note on Ac 14:27</a>.) Paul’s activity in Ephesus had an impact on the preaching efforts in the whole region. He spent some three years in Ephesus (c. 52-55 C.E.), and one result was that the good news of the Kingdom spread throughout the Roman province of Asia. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:10-44:19:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ac 19:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:26-44:19:26" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 26</a>; see Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="104" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077030/">Asia</a>.”) The cities of Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis, which lay inland from Ephesus, heard the good news, though Paul evidently did not visit them in person. He may have sent Epaphras to open up the preaching work there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:12-51:4:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Col 4:12, 13</a>) It seems possible that the good news likewise reached the cities of Philadelphia, Thyatira, and Sardis during this time of great activity.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:10-46:16:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>16:10</strong></a></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>the work of Jehovah:</strong> Paul is here referring to the work, or ministry, that God had given him and Timothy. As Paul mentions at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1Co 3:9</a>, Christians have the privilege of being “God’s fellow workers.”​—For the use of the divine name in this expression, see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">App. C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079346/67-71">1Co 16:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>Now concerning Apollos our brother:</strong> It appears that Apollos must have been in or near Ephesus, where Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. Apollos had been preaching in Corinth earlier (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:24-44:19:1" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ac 18:24–19:1a</a>), and the Corinthians held Apollos in great esteem. Though Paul urged him to visit the Corinthian congregation, Apollos did not intend to go to Corinth at that time. He may have feared stirring up further division in the congregation (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1Co 1:10-12</a>), or he may still have had work to do where he was. At any rate, Paul’s brief statement about “Apollos our brother” shows that these two active missionaries had not allowed the factions in the congregation in Corinth to cause a breach in their own unity, as some Bible commentators have suggested.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:4-46:3:9" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1Co 3:4-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:21-46:3:23" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:6-46:4:7" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 4:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>with the brothers:</strong> Some have suggested that “brothers” may refer to Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, who visited Paul in Ephesus (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:17-46:16:18" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1Co 16:17, 18</a>) and who possibly then delivered this letter to Corinth.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:13-46:16:13" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>16:13</strong></a></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>carry on in a manly way:</strong> Or “be courageous.” The Greek word used here (<em>an·driʹzo·mai</em>) is a verb drawn from the noun <em>a·nerʹ,</em> meaning “a man; a male.” While it literally means “to act like a man,” the primary idea is that of being courageous or brave, which is how it is rendered in many translations. Paul wrote these words to all in the congregation, so women too were to show such courage. Although Paul here encourages Christians to show manly courage, he also describes himself and his companions as being “gentle” and acting like “a nursing mother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:7-52:2:7" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1Th 2:7</a>) The Greek verb <em>an·driʹzo·mai</em> occurs only here in the Christian Greek Scriptures, but it is used more than 20 times in the <em>Septuagint</em> to render synonymous Hebrew expressions that mean “be courageous; be strong.” For example, it is used three times at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:6-5:31:7" data-bid="31-1" class="b">De 31:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:23-5:31:23" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 23</a>, where Moses commanded the people and Joshua to “be courageous.” It is also used three times at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:6-6:1:7" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Jos 1:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:9-6:1:9" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 9</a>, where Jehovah told Joshua to “be . . . strong.”</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>urge:</strong> Or “entreat.”​—For a discussion of the Greek word <em>pa·ra·ka·leʹo</em> used here, see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/12:8$p/E:1001070729/15-15:529">study note on Ro 12:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>the presence of:</strong> Here Paul uses the Greek word <em>pa·rou·siʹa</em> regarding three of his fellow workers who were with him. It is used in a similar sense five times elsewhere in the Christian Greek Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:6-47:7:7" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2Co 7:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:10-47:10:10" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 10:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:26-50:1:26" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> Php 1:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:12-50:2:12" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 2:12</a>) This term is also used in connection with the invisible presence of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Mt 24:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:23-46:15:23" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 1Co 15:23</a>) The term <em>pa·rou·siʹa,</em> or “presence,” can refer to an invisible presence, as indicated by Jewish historian Josephus, writing in Greek, when he refers to God’s <em>pa·rou·siʹa</em> at Mount Sinai. God’s invisible presence was made evident by thunder and lightning. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> III, 80 [v, 2]) Paul uses the related verb <em>paʹrei·mi</em> (“to be present”) when he speaks about being “present in spirit” but “absent in body.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:3-46:5:3" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1Co 5:3</a>) Although many translations render this term “arrival” or “coming,” the rendering “presence” is supported by the way Paul uses it at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:12-50:2:12" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Php 2:12</a> to describe his “presence” in contrast with his “absence.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/15:23$p/E:1001070748/34-34:1061">study note on 1Co 15:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>The congregations of Asia:</strong> That is, in the Roman province of Asia. (See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="104" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077030/">Asia</a>.”) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:10-44:19:10" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ac 19:10</a> says that during Paul’s stay in Ephesus, “all those living in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.” At the time of writing 1 Corinthians (c. 55 C.E.), while staying in Ephesus, Paul likely had in mind congregations in Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:12-51:4:16" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Col 4:12-16</a>) Additionally, other congregations mentioned in the book of Revelation, including those in Smyrna, Pergamum, Sardis, Thyatira, and Philadelphia, may have been established by then and may have been included in these greetings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:4-66:1:4" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Re 1:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:11-66:1:11" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s5"><strong>the congregation that is in their house:</strong> The first-century believers often met together in private homes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:3-45:16:3" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ro 16:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:5-45:16:5" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:15-51:4:15" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Col 4:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:2-57:1:2" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> Phm 2</a>) The Greek word for “congregation” (<em>ek·kle·siʹa</em>) refers to a group of people gathered together for a common purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:28-46:12:28" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1Co 12:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:1-47:1:1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 2Co 1:1</a>) Some Bibles use “church” to render the Greek word <em>ek·kle·siʹa</em> in this and other verses. However, since many think of a church as a building used for religious services rather than as a group of people engaging in worship, the rendering “congregation” is more accurate.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="s5"><strong>O our Lord, come!:</strong> Paul here uses an Aramaic expression transliterated into Greek as <em>Ma·raʹna tha.</em> Similar to other Semitic expressions, such as “Amen” and “Hallelujah,” it was apparently a term known by the Christian congregation, so Paul could use it without further explanation. It expresses a wish similar to the concluding words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:20-66:22:20" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Re 22:20</a>, where the apostle John exclaimed: “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.” According to some scholars, the Aramaic expression is to be transliterated <em>Ma·ranʹ a·thaʹ,</em> which would mean “Our Lord is coming” or “Our Lord has come.”</p>
