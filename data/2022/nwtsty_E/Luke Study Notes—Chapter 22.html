<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, which is called Passover:</strong> Strictly speaking, the Passover, celebrated on Nisan 14, was distinct from the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, which lasted from Nisan 15 to 21. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:5-3:23:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 23:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:28:16-4:28:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Nu 28:16, 17</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070237/">App. B15</a>.) In Jesus’ time, however, these two festivals had become so closely connected that all eight days, including Nisan 14, were treated as one festival. Josephus speaks of “a feast for eight days, which is called the feast of unleavened bread.” The events described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:1-42:22:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 22:1-6</a> occurred on Nisan 12, 33 C.E.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070233/">App. B12</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>Iscariot:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/10:4$p/E:1001070610/14-14:324">study note on Mt 10:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>temple captains:</strong> Here the Greek text literally reads “captains,” but <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:52-42:22:52" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lu 22:52</a> adds “of the temple,” to indicate what kind of captains were referred to. Thus, “temple” was added here for clarification. Luke alone mentions these officials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:1-44:4:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ac 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:24-44:5:24" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 5:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:26-44:5:26" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 26</a>) They were leaders of the temple guards. They may have been included in the discussion with Judas to make the planned arrest of Jesus appear legal.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>silver money:</strong> Lit., “silver,” that is, silver used as money. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:15-40:26:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mt 26:15</a>, the amount of money was “30 silver pieces.” Matthew is the only Gospel writer to mention the amount for which Jesus was betrayed. These were possibly 30 silver shekels minted in Tyre. This sum appears to show the chief priests’ contempt for Jesus, since under the Law, it was the price of a slave. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:32-2:21:32" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex 21:32</a>) Likewise, when the prophet Zechariah asked for his wages from unfaithful Israelites for his prophetic work among God’s people, they weighed out to him “30 pieces of silver,” suggesting that they considered him to be worth no more than a slave.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:12-38:11:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Zec 11:12, 13</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>The day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived:</strong> As mentioned in the <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/22:1$p/E:1001070666/4-4:570">study note on Lu 22:1</a>, the Passover (Nisan 14) and the Festival of the Unleavened Bread (Nisan 15-21) had become so closely connected in Jesus’ time that all eight days, including Nisan 14, were sometimes referred to as “the Festival of the Unleavened Bread.” (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070237/">App. B15</a>.) The day mentioned here refers to Nisan 14 because it is said to be the day <strong>on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered.</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex 12:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:15-2:12:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:17-2:12:18" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:5-3:23:5" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Le 23:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:1-5:16:7" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> De 16:1-7</a>) What is described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:7-42:22:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">verses 7-13</a> likely took place on the afternoon of Nisan 13 in preparation for the Passover meal in the evening, that is, at sunset when Nisan 14 started.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070233/">App. B12</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>when the hour came:</strong> That is, when the evening came, marking the start of Nisan 14.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070213/">App. A7</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070233/">B12</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>accepting a cup:</strong> The cup mentioned here was part of the Passover celebration in Jesus’ day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:15-42:22:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Lu 22:15</a>) The Bible does not state that wine was used at the Passover in Egypt; nor did Jehovah command that it be used during the festival. Therefore, the custom of passing a number of cups of wine among the Passover participants was evidently introduced later on. Jesus did not condemn the use of wine with the meal. Rather, he drank the Passover wine with his apostles after giving <strong>thanks</strong> to God. He later offered them a cup to drink as he instituted the Lord’s Evening Meal.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Lu 22:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>22:19</strong></a></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>took a loaf . . . broke it:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/26:26$p/E:1001070626/46-46:256">study note on Mt 26:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>means:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/26:26$p/E:1001070626/48-48:467">study note on Mt 26:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>22:20</strong></a></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>the evening meal:</strong> Evidently referring to the Passover meal that Jesus ate with his disciples before instituting the Lord’s Evening Meal. Thus Jesus celebrated the Passover according to the accepted custom of the time. He did not alter it or interrupt it by introducing anything new into the observance. In this way, he kept the Law as one who was born a Jew. However, when the Passover had been observed according to the Mosaic Law, Jesus was free to introduce the new evening meal for memorializing his approaching death on that same Passover Day.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>new covenant by virtue of my blood:</strong> Luke is the only Gospel writer to record that Jesus on this occasion referred to a “new covenant,” an allusion to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:31" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jer 31:31</a>. The new covenant, between Jehovah and anointed Christians, was made operative by Jesus’ sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:10-58:8:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb 8:10</a>) Jesus here uses the terms “covenant” and “blood” in a way similar to the way Moses used the terms when acting as mediator and inaugurating the Law covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:8-2:24:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ex 24:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:19-58:9:21" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Heb 9:19-21</a>) Just as the blood of bulls and goats validated the Law covenant between God and the nation of Israel, Jesus’ blood made valid the new covenant that Jehovah would make with spiritual Israel. That covenant went into effect at Pentecost 33 C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:14-58:9:15" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb 9:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>. . . poured out in your behalf:</strong> The words from the middle of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="25-1" class="b">verse 19</a> (“which is to be given . . .”) to the end of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b">verse 20</a> are missing in some manuscripts, but this passage has strong support in early authoritative manuscripts.​—For more information about how ancient manuscripts are used to establish the Greek text, see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070203/12-14">App. A3</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:21-42:22:21" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>22:21</strong></a></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>But look! the hand of my betrayer is with me:</strong> What is described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:21-42:22:23" data-bid="28-1" class="b">verses 21-23</a> evidently does not follow in strict chronological order. A comparison of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:20-40:26:29" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mt 26:20-29</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:17-41:14:25" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Mr 14:17-25</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:21-43:13:30" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Joh 13:21-30</a> indicates that Judas departed before Jesus instituted the Lord’s Evening Meal. Judas had definitely left by the time Christ commended the group for having ‘stuck with him in his trials,’ something that could not have been said about Judas; nor would Judas have been taken into the “covenant . . . for a kingdom.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Lu 22:28-30</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong>is going his way:</strong> According to some scholars, this is a euphemism for “is going to his death.”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:25-42:22:25" data-bid="34-1" class="b"><strong>22:25</strong></a></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>Benefactors:</strong> The Greek word <em>eu·er·geʹtes</em> (lit., “one who is doing good to [others]”) was often used as an honorary title for princes or distinguished people, especially those recognized for their civic contributions. Those “taking the lead” among Christ’s followers should not consider themselves to be “Benefactors” to whom their fellow believers are somehow indebted, for they are not to be like the rulers of this world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:26-42:22:26" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Lu 22:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:26-42:22:26" data-bid="36-1" class="b"><strong>22:26</strong></a></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>the one taking the lead:</strong> The Greek word <em>he·geʹo·mai</em> used here also appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Heb 13:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:24-58:13:24" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 24</a> to describe the work of overseers in the Christian congregation.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>ministering:</strong> Or “serving.” Related to the Greek verb <em>di·a·ko·neʹo,</em> used here, is the noun <em>di·aʹko·nos</em> (minister; servant), which refers to one who does not let up in humbly rendering service in behalf of others. The term is used to describe Christ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:8-45:15:8" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ro 15:8</a>); ministers or servants of Christ, both male and female (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:1-45:16:1" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ro 16:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:5-46:3:7" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 1Co 3:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> Col 1:23</a>); ministerial servants (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:1-50:1:1" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Php 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:8-54:3:8" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 1Ti 3:8</a>); as well as household servants (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:5-43:2:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Joh 2:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:9-43:2:9" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 9</a>) and government officials.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:4-45:13:4" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ro 13:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>serving:</strong> Or “ministering.” The Greek verb <em>di·a·ko·neʹo</em> occurs twice in this verse.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/22:26$p/E:1001070666/32-32:463">study note on Lu 22:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:29-42:22:29" data-bid="44-1" class="b"><strong>22:29</strong></a></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s5"><strong>I make a covenant with you . . . for a kingdom:</strong> The Greek verb <em>di·a·tiʹthe·mai,</em> here rendered “make a covenant,” is related to the noun <em>di·a·theʹke,</em> “covenant.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:25-44:3:25" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ac 3:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:10-58:8:10" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Heb 8:10</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:16-58:10:16" data-bid="46-1" class="b">10:16</a>, both the verb and the noun are used in the phrase “to make [or “conclude” (lit., “covenant”)] a covenant.” Here Jesus makes reference to two covenants, one between him and his Father, and one between him and his anointed followers, who are to join him as corulers in the Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:30-42:22:30" data-bid="47-1" class="b"><strong>22:30</strong></a></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="s5"><strong>eat and drink at my table:</strong> To eat a meal with someone signified friendship and peace between those involved. Therefore, one who was privileged to eat regularly at the table of a king was especially favored and enjoyed a very close bond with the monarch. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:7-11:2:7" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1Ki 2:7</a>) This is the kind of relationship that Jesus here promised his faithful disciples.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Lu 22:28-30</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:29-42:13:29" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Lu 13:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:9-66:19:9" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Re 19:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="s5"><strong>to sift you as wheat:</strong> In Bible times, wheat was sifted, or shaken vigorously to pass through a sieve, after it had been threshed and winnowed. Sifting separated the straw and chaff from the grain. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:12$p/E:1001070603/36-36:141">study note on Mt 3:12</a>.) As a result of the trials Jesus was about to undergo, his disciples would also be tested. Jesus likened this test to the sifting of wheat.</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="s5"><strong>returned:</strong> Or “turned back (around).” It appears that Jesus is referring to Peter’s returning or recovering from his fall that would be caused largely by his overconfidence combined with a fear of man.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Pr 29:25</a>.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="s5"><strong>a rooster:</strong> All four Gospels mention that a rooster would crow, but only Mark’s account adds the detail that the rooster would crow twice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:34-40:26:34" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Mt 26:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:74-40:26:75" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 74, 75;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:30-41:14:30" data-bid="55-3" class="b"> Mr 14:30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:72-41:14:72" data-bid="55-4" class="b"> 72;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:60-42:22:61" data-bid="55-5" class="b"> Lu 22:60, 61;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:38-43:13:38" data-bid="55-6" class="b"> Joh 13:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:27-43:18:27" data-bid="55-7" class="b"> 18:27</a>) The Mishnah indicates that roosters were bred in Jerusalem in Jesus’ day, lending support to the Bible account. This crowing likely occurred very early in the morning.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/13:35$p/E:1001070641/55-55:488">study note on Mr 13:35</a>.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="s5"><strong>Carry on prayer:</strong> Or “Keep praying.” This exhortation, apparently recorded by Luke alone, seems to be addressed to the 11 faithful apostles. (Compare the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:36-40:26:37" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Mt 26:36, 37</a>.) A second, similar exhortation is recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:46-42:22:46" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Lu 22:46</a>, which parallels <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:41-40:26:41" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Mt 26:41</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:38-41:14:38" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Mr 14:38</a>.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="s5"><strong>his sweat became as drops of blood:</strong> Luke may have been drawing a comparison by indicating that Christ’s perspiration formed like drops of blood or by describing how the dripping of Jesus’ sweat resembled the dripping of blood from a wound. On the other hand, some have suggested that Jesus’ blood may have exuded through his skin and may have been mixed with his sweat, a condition that has reportedly occurred in certain cases of extreme mental stress. Blood or the elements thereof will seep through unruptured walls of blood vessels in a condition called diapedesis. In a condition known as hematidrosis, there is an excreting of perspiration tinged with blood pigment or blood or of bodily fluid mingled with blood, thus resulting in the ‘sweating of blood.’ These, of course, are only possible explanations for what may have taken place in Jesus’ case.</p>

<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="s5"><strong>assembly of elders:</strong> Or “council (body) of elders.” The Greek word <em>pre·sby·teʹri·on</em> used here is related to the term <em>pre·sbyʹte·ros</em> (lit., “older man”), which in the Bible primarily refers to those who hold a position of authority and responsibility in a community or a nation. Although the term sometimes refers to physical age (as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:25-42:15:25" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Lu 15:25</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:17-44:2:17" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Ac 2:17</a>), it is not limited to those who are elderly.

The Greek word can refer to the people making up the court itself or to the building or location of the court.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/5:22$p/E:1001070605/50-50:195">study note on Mt 5:22</a> and Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="41" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077267/">Sanhedrin</a>”; see also <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">App. B12</a> for the possible location of the Sanhedrin Hall.</p>
