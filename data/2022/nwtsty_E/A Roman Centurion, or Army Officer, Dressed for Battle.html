He drilled the soldiers; inspected their arms, supplies, and food; and regulated their conduct. For the most part, the readiness and efficiency of the Roman army depended on <a class="xt" data-xtid="47" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077361/">centurions</a> more than on anyone else. They were, generally speaking, the most experienced and valuable men in the Roman army. This made the humility and faith of the <a class="xt" data-xtid="47" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077361/">centurion</a> who approached Jesus all the more impressive.</p>
