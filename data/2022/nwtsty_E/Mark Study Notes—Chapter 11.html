<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>Bethphage:</strong> The name of this village on the Mount of Olives comes from Hebrew, probably meaning “House of the Early Figs.” Tradition locates Bethphage between Jerusalem and Bethany on the SE slope of the Mount of Olives, near the peak, about 1 km (less than 1 mi) from Jerusalem.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:1-40:21:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 21:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:29-42:19:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Lu 19:29</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070213/">App. A7</a>, Map 6.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>a colt:</strong> That is, a young donkey. The accounts of Mark, Luke (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:35-42:19:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">19:35</a>), and John (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:14-43:12:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">12:14, 15</a>) mention only one animal, the colt, when describing this event. Matthew’s account (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:2-40:21:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">21:2-7</a>) adds the detail that the parent donkey was also present.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/21:2$p/E:1001070621/6-6:255">study notes on Mt 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/21:5$p/E:1001070621/12-12:175"> 5</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>Save, we pray:</strong> Lit., “Hosanna.” That Greek term comes from a Hebrew expression that means “save, we pray” or “save, please.” Here the term is used as a plea to God for salvation or victory; it could be rendered “please, grant salvation to.” In time, it became an expression of both prayer and praise. The Hebrew expression is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:25-19:118:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps 118:25</a>, which was part of the Hallel Psalms sung regularly during Passover season. Therefore, these words readily came to mind on this occasion. One way God answered this prayer to save the Son of David was by resurrecting him from the dead. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:10-41:12:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mr 12:10, 11</a>, Jesus himself quotes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:22-19:118:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 118:22, 23</a> and applies it to the Messiah.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah’s:</strong> In this quote from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:25-19:118:26" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps 118:25, 26</a>, the divine name, represented by four Hebrew consonants (transliterated <em>YHWH</em>), occurs in the original Hebrew text.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>the coming Kingdom of our father David:</strong> The earliest and most reliable manuscripts support the main text reading but there are a few ancient manuscripts that read: “The kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of the Lord.” This reading is reflected in some English Bible translations. A number of translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew (referred to as J<sup>7, 8, 10-12, 14, 16, 17</sup> in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070244/">App. C</a>) here use the Tetragrammaton or an abbreviation of it and read: “The kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of Jehovah.”</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>he found nothing but leaves:</strong> Although it was unusual for a fig tree to bear fruit at that time of year, the tree had leaves​—normally a sign that it had produced an early crop of figs. Because the tree had borne only leaves, Jesus knew that it was not going to produce any crop and was therefore deceptive in its appearance. So he cursed it as unproductive, causing it to wither.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:19-41:11:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mr 11:19-21</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>carry a utensil through the temple:</strong> Evidently, some used the temple courtyard as a shortcut to transport items for personal or commercial use. Jesus did not allow this, since it detracted from the sanctity of God’s house. Only Mark’s account mentions this comment by Jesus.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>a house of prayer for all the nations:</strong> Of the three Gospel writers who quote <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:56:7-23:56:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa 56:7</a>, only Mark includes the phrase “for all the nations [peoples].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:13-40:21:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mt 21:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:46-42:19:46" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Lu 19:46</a>) The temple in Jerusalem was meant to be a place where both Israelites and God-fearing foreigners could worship and pray to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:41-11:8:43" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1Ki 8:41-43</a>) Jesus rightly condemned the Jews who used the temple for commerce, making it <strong>a cave of robbers.</strong> Their actions discouraged people of all nations from approaching Jehovah in his house of prayer, depriving them of the opportunity to come to know him.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>cave of robbers:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/21:13$p/E:1001070621/27-27:391">study note on Mt 21:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>late in the day:</strong> That is, late on Nisan 10. Jesus and his disciples <strong>went out of</strong> Jerusalem, returning to Bethany on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. Jesus likely spent the night at the home of his friends Lazarus, Mary, and Martha.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070213/">App. A7</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">B12</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>stand praying:</strong> Among the Hebrews and many of the other nations mentioned in the Bible, there was no set form of posture for prayer. All the attitudes that they assumed were highly respectful. Standing to pray was common.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s5">Some ancient manuscripts here read: “But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your trespasses.” These words do not appear in the earliest and most reliable manuscripts and are evidently not part of the original text of Mark.
