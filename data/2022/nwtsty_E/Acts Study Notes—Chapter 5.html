<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>emboldened you:</strong> Lit., “filled your heart.” In this context, the Greek expression conveys the meaning “to dare to do something; to embolden.” It may reflect a Hebrew idiom with the same meaning. For example, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:7:5-17:7:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Es 7:5</a>, the Hebrew phrase “has filled his heart to” is rendered “has dared to,” and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:11-21:8:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ec 8:11</a>, this idiom is rendered <em>“the heart</em> . . . <em>becomes emboldened to</em> do bad.”</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>the spirit of Jehovah:</strong> The expression “the spirit of Jehovah” (or, “Jehovah’s spirit”) occurs several times in the Hebrew Scriptures.

The expression “Jehovah’s spirit” is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:18-42:4:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lu 4:18</a> as part of a quote from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:1-23:61:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa 61:1</a>. There and in other Hebrew Scripture occurrences, the original Hebrew text uses the Tetragrammaton together with the word for “spirit.” The reasons why the <em>New World Translation</em> uses the expression “the spirit of Jehovah” in the main text, although available Greek manuscripts of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:9-44:5:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ac 5:9</a> read “the spirit of Lord,” are explained in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079344/43-51">Ac 5:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>congregation:</strong> This is the first occurrence of the Greek word <em>ek·kle·siʹa</em> in the book of Acts. The term comes from two Greek words, <em>ek,</em> meaning “out,” and <em>ka·leʹo,</em> meaning “to call.” It refers to a group of people called together for a particular purpose or activity, so the term well describes the newly established Christian congregation. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="61" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077066/">Glossary</a>.) The word <em>ek·kle·siʹa</em> is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:18-40:16:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 16:18</a> (see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/16:18$p/E:1001070616/31-31:901">study note</a>), where Jesus foretells the formation of the Christian congregation made up of anointed Christians. They are living stones who are “being built up into a spiritual house.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:4-60:2:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1Pe 2:4, 5</a>) In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the term applies not only to the composite group of anointed Christians but also to all Christians living in a geographic area or to Christians making up a local congregation. In the context of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:11-44:5:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ac 5:11</a>, the term refers to the Christian congregation in Jerusalem.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/7:38$p/E:1001070696/46-46:857">study note on Ac 7:38</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>wonders:</strong> Or “portents.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/2:19$p/E:1001070691/24-24:448">study note on Ac 2:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah’s angel:</strong> Starting at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:7-1:16:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ge 16:7</a>, this phrase is often found in the Hebrew Scriptures as a combination of the Hebrew word for “angel” and the Tetragrammaton. When it occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:3:5-38:3:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Zec 3:5, 6</a> in an early copy of the <em>Septuagint,</em> the Greek word <em>agʹge·los</em> (angel; messenger) is followed by the divine name written in Hebrew characters. This fragment, found in a cave in Nahal Hever, Israel, in the Judean Desert, is dated between 50 B.C.E. and 50 C.E. The reasons why the <em>New World Translation</em> uses the expression “Jehovah’s angel” in the main text, although available Greek manuscripts of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:19-44:5:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ac 5:19</a> read “Lord’s angel,” are explained in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079344/52-57">Ac 5:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:21-44:5:21" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>5:21</strong></a></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>the entire assembly of elders:</strong> Or “the entire council (body) of elders.” The Greek word <em>ge·rou·siʹa</em> used here is related to the term <em>geʹron</em> (lit., “old man”), which is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:4-43:3:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Joh 3:4</a>. Both terms are used only once in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Some consider the expression “assembly of elders” to be synonymous with <strong>the Sanhedrin,</strong> the Jewish high court in Jerusalem, which was made up of chief priests, scribes, and elders. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/22:66$p/E:1001070666/67-67:784">study note on Lu 22:66</a>.) However, in this context, the two expressions, “the Sanhedrin” and the “assembly of elders,” should apparently be viewed as two entities that were not mutually exclusive. Some members of the “assembly of elders” might officially have been members of the Sanhedrin, while others might have played an advisory role to the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>the sons of Israel:</strong> Or “the people of Israel; the Israelites.”​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="105" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077149/">Israel</a>.”</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>a stake:</strong> Or “a tree.” The Greek word <em>xyʹlon</em> (lit., “wood”) is here used as a synonym for the Greek word <em>stau·rosʹ</em> (rendered “torture stake”) and describes the instrument of execution to which Jesus was nailed. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, Luke, Paul, and Peter used the word <em>xyʹlon</em> in this sense five times altogether. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:30-44:5:30" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ac 5:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:39-44:10:39" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 10:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:29-44:13:29" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 13:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:13-48:3:13" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> Ga 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:24-60:2:24" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> 1Pe 2:24</a>) In the <em>Septuagint, xyʹlon</em> is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:22-5:21:23" data-bid="23-1" class="b">De 21:22, 23</a> to translate the corresponding Hebrew word <em>ʽets</em> (meaning “tree; wood; piece of wood”) in the sentence “and you have hung him on <em>a stake.”</em> When Paul quotes this scripture at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:13-48:3:13" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ga 3:13</a>, <em>xyʹlon</em> is used in the sentence: “Accursed is every man hung upon <em>a stake.”</em> This Greek word is also used in the <em>Septuagint</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:11-15:6:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezr 6:11</a> (1 Esdras 6:31, <em>LXX</em>) to translate the Aramaic word <em>ʼaʽ,</em> corresponding to the Hebrew term <em>ʽets.</em> There it is said regarding violators of a Persian king’s decree: <em>“A timber</em> will be pulled out of his house and he will be lifted up and fastened to it.” The fact that Bible writers used <em>xyʹlon</em> as a synonym for <em>stau·rosʹ</em> provides added evidence that Jesus was executed on an upright stake without a crossbeam, for that is what <em>xyʹlon</em> in this special sense means.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>Chief Agent:</strong> The Greek term used here (<em>ar·khe·gosʹ</em>) basically means “chief leader; one who goes first.” It is used four times in the Bible, all referring to Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:15-44:3:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ac 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:31-44:5:31" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 5:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:10-58:2:10" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Heb 2:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> 12:2</a>) Here it is used along with the title “Savior.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/3:15$p/E:1001070692/9-9:1599">study note on Ac 3:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>they were infuriated:</strong> Or “they felt cut.” The Greek expression occurs only here and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:54-44:7:54" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ac 7:54</a>. It literally means “to be sawn through” but is used figuratively in both occurrences to describe a strong emotional response.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>Gamaliel:</strong> A Law teacher mentioned twice in Acts, here and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:3-44:22:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ac 22:3</a>. He is thought to be Gamaliel the Elder, as he is known in non-Biblical sources. Gamaliel was the grandson, or possibly the son, of Hillel the Elder, who is credited with developing a more liberal school of thought among the Pharisees. Gamaliel was so highly <strong>esteemed</strong> among the people that he is said to be the first to be called by the honorific title “Rabban.” Therefore, he greatly influenced the Jewish society of his time by training many sons of Pharisees, such as Saul of Tarsus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:3-44:22:3" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ac 22:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:6-44:23:6" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 23:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:4-44:26:5" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> 26:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:13-48:1:14" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> Ga 1:13, 14</a>) He often interpreted the Law and traditions in a way that appears to have been comparatively broad-minded. For example, he is said to have enacted laws protecting wives against unprincipled husbands and defending widows against unprincipled children. He is also said to have argued that poor non-Jews should have the same gleaning rights as poor Jews. This tolerant attitude is evident in the way Gamaliel treated Peter and the other apostles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:35-44:5:39" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ac 5:35-39</a>) Rabbinic records show, however, that Gamaliel placed greater emphasis on rabbinic tradition than on the Holy Scriptures. Therefore, on the whole, his teachings were similar to those of most of his rabbinic forefathers and the religious leaders of his day.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:3-40:15:9" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Mt 15:3-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 2Ti 3:16, 17</a>; see Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="36" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077226/">Pharisees</a>”; “<a class="xt" data-xtid="41" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077267/">Sanhedrin</a>.”</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>from house to house:</strong> This expression translates the Greek phrase <em>katʼ oiʹkon,</em> literally, “according to house.” Several lexicons and commentators state that the Greek preposition <em>ka·taʹ</em> can be understood in a distributive sense. For example, one lexicon says that the phrase refers to “places viewed serially, distributive use . . . from house to house.” (<em>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature,</em> Third Edition) Another reference says that the preposition <em>ka·taʹ</em> is “distributive (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:46-44:2:46" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 2:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 5:42</a>: . . . house <em>to</em> house/<em>in</em> the [individual] houses.” (<em>Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament,</em> edited by Horst Balz and Gerhard Schneider) Bible scholar R.C.H. Lenski made the following comment: “Never for a moment did the apostles cease their blessed work. ‘Every day’ they continued, and this openly ‘in the Temple’ where the Sanhedrin and the Temple police could see and hear them, and, of course, also κατ’ οἴκον, which is distributive, ‘from house to house,’ and not merely adverbial, ‘at home.’” (<em>The Interpretation of the Acts of the Apostles,</em> 1961) These sources support the sense that the disciples’ preaching was distributed from one house to another. A similar use of <em>ka·taʹ</em> occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:1-42:8:1" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Lu 8:1</a>, where Jesus is said to have preached “from city to city and from village to village.” This method of reaching people by going directly to their homes brought outstanding results.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:7-44:6:7" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ac 6:7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:16-44:4:17" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ac 4:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:28-44:5:28" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 5:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>declaring the good news:</strong> The Greek verb <em>eu·ag·ge·liʹzo·mai,</em> used here, is related to the noun <em>eu·ag·geʹli·on,</em> “good news.” In the Christian Greek Scriptures, an important aspect of the good news is closely linked with God’s Kingdom, the theme of Jesus’ preaching and teaching work, and with the salvation by faith in Jesus Christ. In the book of Acts, the Greek verb <em>eu·ag·ge·liʹzo·mai</em> occurs numerous times, emphasizing the preaching work.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:4-44:8:4" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ac 8:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:12-44:8:12" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:25-44:8:25" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:35-44:8:35" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:40-44:8:40" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:36-44:10:36" data-bid="42-6" class="b"> 10:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:20-44:11:20" data-bid="42-7" class="b"> 11:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:32-44:13:32" data-bid="42-8" class="b"> 13:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:7-44:14:7" data-bid="42-9" class="b"> 14:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:15-44:14:15" data-bid="42-10" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:21-44:14:21" data-bid="42-11" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:35-44:15:35" data-bid="42-12" class="b"> 15:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:10-44:16:10" data-bid="42-13" class="b"> 16:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:18-44:17:18" data-bid="42-14" class="b"> 17:18</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/4:23$p/E:1001070604/61-61:251">study notes on Mt 4:23;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:14$p/E:1001070624/31-31:376"> 24:14</a>.</p>
