<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">The coin shown here was minted about 43-44 C.E. by Herod Agrippa I, referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:1-44:12:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 12:1</a> as “Herod the king.” The coin shows on one side the head of Emperor Claudius and on the other side figures of Claudius and Agrippa I. The inscription includes Agrippa’s name. Claudius’ predecessor and nephew, Emperor Caligula (who ruled from 37 to 41 C.E. and who is not mentioned in the Scriptures), appointed Herod Agrippa I to be king in the year 37 C.E. Later, Claudius placed more territory under Agrippa’s jurisdiction. Herod Agrippa I violently persecuted the early Christian congregation; he even had the apostle James executed and Peter imprisoned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:1-44:12:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 12:1-4</a>) Herod retained his position of power until Jehovah’s angel struck him and he died.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:21-44:12:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 12:21-23</a>.</p>
