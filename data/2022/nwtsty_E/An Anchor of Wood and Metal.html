<p id="p7" data-pid="7">In the account of Paul’s voyage to Rome, the use of anchors is mentioned repeatedly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:13-44:27:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 27:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:29-44:27:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 29, 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:40-44:27:40" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 40</a>) In ancient times, the first anchors seem to have been stone weights and other simple devices. By the time of Paul’s travels, however, more advanced anchors had been developed. Shown here is a drawing of a hook anchor that was common in Roman times. This kind of anchor was usually made of metal and wood. The heavy stock, typically made of lead, weighed the anchor down, and one of the anchor’s arms dug into the seafloor. Large boats often had a number of anchors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:29-44:27:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 27:29, 30</a>) An anchor discovered near Cyrene, on the African coast, weighs about 545 kg (1,200 lb), giving added meaning to Paul’s statement that “we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:6:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb 6:19</a>.</p>
