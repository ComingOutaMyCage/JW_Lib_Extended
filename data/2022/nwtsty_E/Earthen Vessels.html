In his second inspired letter to the Corinthian congregation, Paul compared Christians to this type of inexpensive container. Each day, the disciples in Corinth handled clay jars, pots, and lamps common to the routines of life. As they handled these breakable vessels, the disciples would be reminded of having the correct view of themselves and the privileges Jehovah had granted them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:1-47:4:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Co 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:5-47:4:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5-11</a>.</p>
