<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Pentecost:</strong> The Greek word <em>pen·te·ko·steʹ</em> (meaning “50th [Day]”) is used in the Christian Greek Scriptures to denote what is called “the Festival of Harvest” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:16-2:23:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 23:16</a>) and the “Festival of Weeks” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:22-2:34:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 34:22</a>) in the Hebrew Scriptures. This festival took place at the end of a seven-week harvest period that included first the barley harvest and then the wheat harvest. The Festival of Pentecost was celebrated on the 50th day counted from Nisan 16, the day when a sheaf of the firstfruits of the barley harvest was offered. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:15-3:23:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Le 23:15, 16</a>) On the Hebrew calendar, Pentecost falls on Sivan 6. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070237/">App. B15</a>.) Instructions for this festival are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:15-3:23:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Le 23:15-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:28:26-4:28:31" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Nu 28:26-31</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:9-5:16:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">De 16:9-12</a>. The Festival of Pentecost drew great multitudes of Jews and proselytes from distant lands to Jerusalem. The festival was intended to promote hospitality and kindness to people, regardless of their position or background​—whether they were free, slaves, poor, fatherless, widows, Levites, or foreign residents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:10-5:16:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">De 16:10, 11</a>) This made Pentecost 33 C.E. in Jerusalem an ideal occasion for the birth of the Christian congregation with its mission to bear witness to all people “about the magnificent things of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ac 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:11-44:2:11" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:11</a>) The Jews traditionally hold that Pentecost corresponded to the time of the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai when Israel was set apart as God’s chosen nation. It was early in the third month (Sivan) that the Israelites gathered at Mount Sinai and received the Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:1-2:19:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex 19:1</a>) Just as Moses as mediator was used to introduce Israel to the Law covenant, so Jesus Christ as Mediator of spiritual Israel now brought that new nation into the new covenant.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>languages:</strong> Or “tongues.” In the Bible, the Greek word <em>glosʹsa</em> can refer to the “tongue” as an organ of speech. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:33-41:7:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mr 7:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:64-42:1:64" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Lu 1:64;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:24-42:16:24" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 16:24</a>) But it can also be used figuratively to refer to a language or to a people speaking a certain language. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Re 5:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:7-66:13:7" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 13:7</a>; ftns.) This Greek word is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:3-44:2:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ac 2:3</a>, describing “tongues as if of fire” that became visible. So the outpouring of holy spirit was made evident by these “tongues” resting on each one of the disciples and by their speaking in different tongues, or languages.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>his own native language:</strong> Lit., “our own language in which we were born.” The Greek word here rendered “language” is <em>di·aʹle·ktos.</em> (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/2:4$p/E:1001070691/6-6:522">study note on Ac 2:4</a>.) Many who heard the disciples may have spoken an international tongue, perhaps Greek. Being “devout Jews,” they may also have been able to understand the Hebrew services at the temple in Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:5-44:2:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ac 2:5</a>) But hearing the good news in the language they had known from childhood caught their attention.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>sweet wine:</strong> Or “new wine.” The Greek word <em>gleuʹkos,</em> which occurs only here in the Christian Greek Scriptures, refers to sweet new wine that is in the process of fermentation.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:15-44:2:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>2:15</strong></a></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>the third hour of the day:</strong> That is, about 9:00 a.m. In the first century C.E., the Jews used the count of 12 hours to the day, starting with sunrise at about 6:00 a.m. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:9-43:11:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Joh 11:9</a>) Therefore, the third hour would be about 9:00 a.m., the sixth hour about noon, and the ninth hour about 3:00 p.m. Since people did not have precise timepieces, only the approximate time of an event was usually given.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:39-43:1:39" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Joh 1:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:6-43:4:6" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:14-43:19:14" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 19:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:3-44:10:3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> Ac 10:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:9-44:10:9" data-bid="21-5" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:17-44:2:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>2:17</strong></a></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>in the last days:</strong> In this quote from Joel’s prophecy, Peter under inspiration uses the phrase “in the last days” rather than the expression “after that,” which is used in the original Hebrew and in the <em>Septuagint.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:28-29:2:28" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Joe 2:28</a> [3:1, <em>LXX</em>]) Joel’s prophecy was fulfilled when holy spirit was poured out at Pentecost. Therefore, Peter’s use of the term “the last days” indicates that this special time period had begun and that it would precede “the great and illustrious day of Jehovah.” This “day of Jehovah” would apparently bring “the last days” to their conclusion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:20-44:2:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ac 2:20</a>) Peter was speaking to natural Jews and Jewish proselytes, so his inspired words must have had an initial fulfillment involving them. His statement apparently indicated that the Jews were living in “the last days” of the system of things that had its center of worship in Jerusalem. Earlier, Jesus himself foretold the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:41-42:19:44" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Lu 19:41-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:5-42:21:6" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 21:5, 6</a>) That destruction took place in 70 C.E.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>my spirit:</strong> The Greek word <em>pneuʹma</em> here refers to God’s holy spirit, or active force. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:28-29:2:28" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Joe 2:28</a>, quoted here, the corresponding Hebrew word <em>ruʹach</em> is used. Both the Hebrew and the Greek words convey the basic idea of that which is invisible to human sight and gives evidence of force in motion.​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077302/">Spirit</a>.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>every sort of flesh:</strong> Or “all sorts (kinds) of people.” Lit., “all flesh.” The Greek word <em>sarx</em> (often rendered “flesh”) is here used of living humans, so “all flesh” would generally refer to all mankind. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/17:2$p/E:1001070685/4-4:196">study note on Joh 17:2</a>.) But in this context, the Greek phrase “all flesh” has a more restricted use. God did not pour out his spirit on all humans on earth or even on all humans in Israel, so it does not refer to all humans without exception. Rather, the phrase here refers to all sorts of humans without distinction. God poured out holy spirit on ‘sons and daughters, young men and old men, male slaves and female slaves,’ that is, all sorts of people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:17-44:2:18" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ac 2:17, 18</a>) A similar use of the Greek word for “all” (<em>pas</em>) is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:3-54:2:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1Ti 2:3, 4</a>, according to which it is God’s will that <em>“all sorts</em> of people should be saved.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/12:32$p/E:1001070680/50-50:871">study note on Joh 12:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>prophesy:</strong> The Greek term <em>pro·phe·teuʹo</em> literally means “to speak out.” In the Scriptures, it is used of making known messages from a divine source. While it often includes the thought of foretelling the future, the basic meaning of the word is not that of prediction. The Greek word can also refer to identifying a matter by divine revelation. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/26:68$p/E:1001070626/99-99:295">study notes on Mt 26:68;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/14:65$p/E:1001070642/83-83:435"> Mr 14:65;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/22:64$p/E:1001070666/65-65:278"> Lu 22:64</a>.) In this context, holy spirit impelled some to prophesy. By declaring “the magnificent things” that Jehovah had done and would still do, they would serve as spokesmen for the Most High. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:11-44:2:11" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ac 2:11</a>) The Hebrew word for “to prophesy” carries a similar idea. For example, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:1-2:7:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ex 7:1</a>, Aaron is referred to as Moses’ “prophet” in the sense that he became Moses’ spokesman, or mouthpiece, rather than in the sense of foretelling future events.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>old men:</strong> Or “older men; elders.” Here the Greek term <em>pre·sbyʹte·ros</em> likely refers to men of advanced physical age in contrast with the “young men” mentioned earlier in the verse. In other contexts, the same term is used to refer to men holding a position of authority and responsibility in a community or a nation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:5-44:4:5" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ac 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:30-44:11:30" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 11:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:23-44:14:23" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 14:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:2-44:15:2" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> 15:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:17-44:20:17" data-bid="31-5" class="b"> 20:17</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/16:21$p/E:1001070616/41-41:547">study note on Mt 16:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:19-44:2:19" data-bid="32-1" class="b"><strong>2:19</strong></a></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>wonders:</strong> Or “portents.” In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the Greek word <em>teʹras</em> is consistently used in combination with <em>se·meiʹon</em> (“sign”), both terms being used in the plural form. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:24-40:24:24" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Mt 24:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:48-43:4:48" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Joh 4:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:36-44:7:36" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> Ac 7:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:3-44:14:3" data-bid="33-4" class="b"> 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:12-44:15:12" data-bid="33-5" class="b"> 15:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:12-47:12:12" data-bid="33-6" class="b"> 2Co 12:12</a>) Basically, <em>teʹras</em> refers to anything that causes awe or wonderment. When the term clearly refers to something portending what will happen in the future, the alternate rendering “portent” is used in a study note.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>wonders:</strong> Or “portents.” The miracles that God caused Jesus to perform served as credentials that he was sent by God. These miraculous cures and resurrections also showed, or portended, what Jesus would do on a greater scale in the future.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/2:19$p/E:1001070691/24-24:448">study note on Ac 2:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s5"><strong>will:</strong> Or “counsel.” The Greek word <em>bou·leʹ</em> is rendered “counsel [or, “direction; guidance,” ftn.]” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:30-42:7:30" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Lu 7:30</a> and “purpose” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:17-58:6:17" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Heb 6:17</a>.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/20:27$p/E:1001070709/29-29:332">study note on Ac 20:27</a>.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="s5"><strong>the pangs of death:</strong> Although the Bible clearly states that there is no consciousness or feeling of pain in death (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:4-19:146:4" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ps 146:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> Ec 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 10</a>), here “death” is said to cause “pangs” or “pain.” This wording was likely used because death is presented as a bitter and distressing experience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:32-9:15:32" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1Sa 15:32</a>, ftn.; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:4-19:55:4" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps 55:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:26-21:7:26" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Ec 7:26</a>) That is so not only in the pain usually preceding it (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:4-19:73:5" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 73:4, 5</a>) but also in the loss of all activity and freedom that its paralyzing grip brings (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:6:5-19:6:5" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps 6:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:10-19:88:10" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 88:10</a>). It is apparently in this sense that Jesus’ resurrection released him from “the pangs of death,” freeing him from its distressing and restraining grip. While the Greek word (<em>o·dinʹ</em>), here translated “pangs,” is elsewhere used to mean the pains of childbirth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:3-52:5:3" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1Th 5:3</a>), it may also refer to pain, calamity, or distress in a general sense (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:8-40:24:8" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Mt 24:8</a>). The expression “pangs of death” is found in the <em>Septuagint</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:6-10:22:6" data-bid="50-1" class="b">2Sa 22:6</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:4-19:18:4" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ps 18:4</a> (17:5, <em>LXX</em>), where the Hebrew Masoretic text reads “ropes of the Grave” and “ropes of death.” Interestingly, in ancient Hebrew manuscripts, which were written without vowels, the term for “rope” (<em>cheʹvel</em>) has the same consonantal spelling as the Hebrew term for “pang.” This may explain the rendering found in the <em>Septuagint.</em> In either case, the expressions “pangs of death” and “ropes of death” convey the same overall idea, namely, the bitter and distressing experience of death.</p>

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah:</strong> The divine name, represented by four Hebrew consonants (transliterated <em>YHWH</em>), occurs in the original Hebrew text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:1" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Ps 110:1</a>, quoted here. However, as explained in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070205/">App. A5</a>, most Bible translations do not use God’s name in what is commonly called the New Testament, not even in quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. It is worth noting, though, that some 17th-century editions of the <em>King James Version</em> have the rendering “the L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>” in capital and small capitals here and at three other places where <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:1" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Ps 110:1</a> is quoted in the Christian Greek Scriptures.

Since “the L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>” is used in the Hebrew Scriptures of that translation to indicate where the original Hebrew text uses the divine name, writing “the L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>” in the Christian Greek Scriptures would indicate that the translators thought that it is Jehovah who is being referred to. It is also noteworthy that the <em>New King James Version,</em> first published in 1979, extends this use of “the L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>” to all occurrences of that word when it refers to the divine name in quotes from the Hebrew Scriptures.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C</a>.</p>

Previously, John the Baptist had been “preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins.” (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/1:4$p/E:1001070629/19-19:464">study note on Mr 1:4</a>.) This baptism involved repentance for straying far from obedience to the precepts of the Law of Moses, and this repentance prepared God’s people for what was to come. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:2-41:1:4" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Mr 1:2-4</a>) But Peter here pointed out that in harmony with Jesus’ command found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Mt 28:19</a>, God’s people would need to repent and <strong>be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of . . . sins.</strong> Since the Jews had rejected Jesus as the Messiah, repenting and exercising faith in him was a new and vital factor in seeking and receiving God’s forgiveness. They could give public evidence of such faith by being immersed in water in the name of Jesus Christ. In that way, they would symbolize their personal dedication to God through Christ.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:8$p/E:1001070603/28-28:225">study notes on Mt 3:8,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:11$p/E:1001070603/31-31:78"> 11</a> and Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="34" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077253/">Repentance</a>.”</p>
