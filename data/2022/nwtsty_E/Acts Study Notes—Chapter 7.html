<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>Go out from your land:</strong> When speaking to the Sanhedrin, Stephen says that Abraham was given this command when “the God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he took up residence in Haran.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:2-44:7:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 7:2</a>) Abraham (first known as Abram) was originally from the Chaldean city of Ur. As Stephen indicated, that was apparently where Abraham was first told to go out from his land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:28-1:11:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 11:28, 29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:31-1:11:31" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:7-1:15:7" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 15:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:5-1:17:5" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 17:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:7-16:9:7" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Ne 9:7</a>) The account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:31-1:12:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 11:31–12:3</a> may give the impression that this command was first given after the death of Abraham’s father, Terah, when Abraham had temporarily settled in Haran. However, in view of that account, taken together with Stephen’s comment here, it is reasonable to conclude that Jehovah gave Abraham this command when he was still in Ur and then repeated the command while Abraham was living in Haran.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>afflict them for 400 years:</strong> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:13-1:15:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 15:13</a>, which is quoted here, God told Abram (Abraham) that his descendants would be enslaved and afflicted for 400 years. This period ended when Jehovah freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt on Nisan 14, 1513 B.C.E., so it must have begun in 1913 B.C.E. Bible chronology indicates that in that year, Abraham’s offspring Isaac​—who was about five years old at the time​—began to be mocked and mistreated by Ishmael, his half brother. Ishmael was born some 19 years earlier to Sarai’s (Sarah’s) Egyptian servant Hagar. Ishmael may have taunted his younger brother because Isaac was to receive the firstborn’s inheritance even though Ishmael was born first. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:1-1:16:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ge 16:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:8-1:21:10" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 21:8-10</a>) Paul later described Ishmael’s treatment of Isaac as persecution. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:29-48:4:29" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ga 4:29</a>) Apparently, it was severe enough for Jehovah to approve of Sarah’s demand that Abraham drive Ishmael and his mother away. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:11-1:21:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ge 21:11-13</a>) So Isaac was the first of Abraham’s offspring to experience the foretold affliction. Therefore, this incident, recorded in detail in the divine record, apparently marks the commencement of the prophesied 400-year period of affliction that would not end until the Exodus.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>offer sacred service to me:</strong> Or “worship me.” The Greek verb <em>la·treuʹo</em> basically denotes serving but in some contexts may be rendered “to worship.” The second part of the verse alludes to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:12-2:3:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex 3:12</a>, where the corresponding Hebrew verb can be rendered “serve” or “worship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:12-2:3:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ex 3:12</a>; ftn.) In Scriptural usage, the Greek word <em>la·treuʹo</em> generally refers to serving God or to service connected with worship of God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Mt 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:74-42:1:74" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Lu 1:74;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:37-42:2:37" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 2:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:8-42:4:8" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:9-45:1:9" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> Ro 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:3-50:3:3" data-bid="17-6" class="b"> Php 3:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:3-55:1:3" data-bid="17-7" class="b"> 2Ti 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:14-58:9:14" data-bid="17-8" class="b"> Heb 9:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:28-58:12:28" data-bid="17-9" class="b"> 12:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:15-66:7:15" data-bid="17-10" class="b"> Re 7:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:3-66:22:3" data-bid="17-11" class="b"> 22:3</a>), including service at the sanctuary or temple (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:5-58:8:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Heb 8:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:9-58:9:9" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:2-58:10:2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 10:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:10-58:13:10" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 13:10</a>). In a few cases, it refers to false worship​—rendering service to, or worshipping, created things.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:42-44:7:42" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ac 7:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:25-45:1:25" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ro 1:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:8-44:7:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>7:8</strong></a></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>and Isaac became the father of Jacob:</strong> The Greek text does not repeat either of the two preceding verbs “became the father of” and “circumcised.” Therefore, either or both of these verbs could be implied in the last part of the verse. Thus, it is also possible to render that part of the verse: “And Isaac did the same with [that is, circumcised] Jacob, and Jacob with the 12 family heads.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>family heads:</strong> Or “patriarchs.” The Greek word <em>pa·tri·arʹkhes</em> occurs four times in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Here it refers to Jacob’s 12 sons (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:23-1:35:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ge 35:23-26</a>), and it is also used with regard to David (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:29-44:2:29" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ac 2:29</a>) and Abraham (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:4-58:7:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb 7:4</a>).</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:14-44:7:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>7:14</strong></a></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>75 persons in all:</strong> Stephen may not be quoting a particular verse from the Hebrew Scriptures when he gives the total number of Jacob’s family in Egypt as 75. This figure is not found in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Scriptures. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:26-1:46:26" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ge 46:26</a> says: “All those who descended from Jacob and went into Egypt with him, aside from the wives of Jacob’s sons, were 66.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:27-1:46:27" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Verse 27</a> continues: “All the people of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were 70.” Here the people are counted in two different ways, the first figure apparently including only his natural descendants and the second figure giving the total of those who came into Egypt. The number of Jacob’s descendants is also mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:5-2:1:5" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex 1:5</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:22-5:10:22" data-bid="28-1" class="b">De 10:22</a>, where the figure “70” is given. Stephen apparently gives a third figure that includes more of Jacob’s extended family. Some suggest that it includes sons and grandsons of Joseph’s sons Manasseh and Ephraim, who are mentioned in the <em>Septuagint</em> translation of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:20-1:46:20" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ge 46:20</a>. Others suggest that it includes the wives of Jacob’s sons, who are specifically excluded from the figure given at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:26-1:46:26" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ge 46:26</a>. So the figure “75” may be a grand total. This figure, though, may have a basis in copies of the Hebrew Scriptures circulating in the first century C.E. For years, scholars have known that “75” was the figure given at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:27-1:46:27" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ge 46:27</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:5-2:1:5" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ex 1:5</a> in the Greek <em>Septuagint.</em> Additionally, in the 20th century, two Dead Sea Scroll fragments of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:5-2:1:5" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ex 1:5</a> in Hebrew were discovered, and they also use the figure “75.” Stephen’s figure may be based on one of those ancient texts. Regardless of which idea is correct, Stephen’s figure simply reflects a different way of counting the total number of Jacob’s descendants.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>persons:</strong> Or “souls.” The Greek word <em>psy·kheʹ,</em> traditionally rendered “soul,” here refers to a living person.​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077299/">Soul</a>,” and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070202/9-9">App. A2</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>divinely beautiful:</strong> The Greek expression used here literally means “beautiful to God.” This phrase reflects a Semitic idiom used to refer to what is superlative. In this context, it may convey a dual idea of being “extremely beautiful” and of being “beautiful in the sight of God.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:2-2:2:2" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ex 2:2</a>.) Some scholars suggest that the expression could refer not only to a person’s physical attributes but also to the inner qualities that God sees in a person. A similar construction occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:3-32:3:3" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jon 3:3</a> where, according to a literal rendering of the Hebrew text, Nineveh is described as “a city great to God,” conveying the idea of “a very large city.”​—For other examples, see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:6-1:23:6" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ge 23:6</a>; ftn.; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:6-19:36:6" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps 36:6</a>; ftn.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians:</strong> Stephen’s speech before the Sanhedrin includes a number of facts of Jewish history that are not found in the Hebrew Scriptures. For example, Stephen alone speaks of Moses’ Egyptian education.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong>reached the age of 40:</strong> Stephen’s speech before the Sanhedrin includes a number of facts concerning Jewish history that are not found in the Hebrew Scriptures. For example, Stephen reveals that Moses was 40 years of age when he fled Egypt.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>it came into his heart:</strong> Or “the thought came to him; he decided.” This Greek expression reflects a Hebrew idiom.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isa 65:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:16-24:3:16" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Jer 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>the sons of Israel:</strong> Or “people of Israel; the Israelites.”​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="105" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077149/">Israel</a>.”</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>40 years:</strong> The Hebrew Scriptures do not explicitly state how many years Moses stayed in Midian. But here Stephen reveals facts of Jewish history not previously recorded in the Scriptures. He states that Moses was 40 years of age when he fled to Midian (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:11-2:2:11" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ex 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:23-44:7:23" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> Ac 7:23</a>) and that he stayed there until an additional 40 years had passed or were near completion. So the period referred to here apparently runs from 1553 to 1513 B.C.E. Stephen’s account agrees with the statement that Moses was 80 years old when he spoke to Pharaoh (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:7-2:7:7" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ex 7:7</a>) and led the people of Israel out of Egypt. It also harmonizes with the statement that Moses was 120 years old when he died after spending 40 years in the wilderness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:7-5:34:7" data-bid="45-1" class="b">De 34:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:36-44:7:36" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Ac 7:36</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>an angel:</strong> Stephen is here referring to the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:2-2:3:2" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ex 3:2</a>, where the original Hebrew text says “Jehovah’s angel.” Most Greek manuscripts read “an angel” here, but a few manuscripts and a few ancient translations into other languages have a reading that can be rendered “an angel of [the] Lord [or, “of Jehovah”].” A number of translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew (referred to as J<sup>7, 8, 10-12, 14-17, 28</sup> in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070244/">App. C4</a>) use the Tetragrammaton here and read “Jehovah’s angel.”</p>

In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:4-2:3:4" data-bid="50-1" class="b">verse 4</a>, “Jehovah” calls out to Moses by means of His angel, and in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:6-2:3:6" data-bid="51-1" class="b">verse 6</a>, “Jehovah” tells him what is quoted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:32-44:7:32" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ac 7:32</a>.

Before and during these 40 years, Moses performed <strong>wonders and signs.</strong> For example, when Moses returned to Egypt, he first performed signs before all the Israelite elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:30-2:4:31" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ex 4:30, 31</a>) Then, in the time leading up to the Exodus, Moses was instrumental in performing great wonders and signs before Pharaoh and all the people of Egypt.

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="s5"><strong>the tent of the witness:</strong> Or “the tabernacle of the testimony.” In the <em>Septuagint,</em> which may have influenced Luke’s wording of this verse, this expression is used to render the Hebrew term for “the tent of meeting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:27:21-2:27:21" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ex 27:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:43-2:28:43" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> 28:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:1-4:1:1" data-bid="79-3" class="b"> Nu 1:1</a>) During Israel’s wilderness trek, this tent was where the ark of the covenant, with its principal contents, the “two tablets of the Testimony,” was kept.

<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="s5"><strong>Saul:</strong> Meaning “Asked [of God]; Inquired [of God].” Saul, also known by his Roman name Paul, was “of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born from Hebrews.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:5-50:3:5" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Php 3:5</a>) Since Saul was born a Roman citizen (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:28-44:22:28" data-bid="114-1" class="b">Ac 22:28</a>), it is logical that his Jewish parents may have given him the Roman name Paulus, or Paul, meaning “Little; Small.” From childhood, he likely had both names. His parents may have named him Saul for a number of reasons. Saul was a traditional name of importance among Benjaminites because the first king over all Israel, a Benjaminite, was named Saul.

Another possibility is that his father’s name was Saul, and according to custom, the son was named after the father.

<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="s5"><strong>he made this appeal: “Lord Jesus”:</strong> As mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:55-44:7:56" data-bid="120-1" class="b">verses 55 and 56</a>, Stephen had a vision in which he saw “the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God’s right hand.” So Stephen clearly distinguished Jesus from Jehovah. Stephen was aware that Jehovah had given Jesus the power to resurrect the dead. It would therefore have been natural for Stephen to speak directly to Jesus, whom he had seen in the vision, and to ask Jesus to safeguard his <strong>spirit,</strong> or life force. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:27-43:5:29" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Joh 5:27-29</a>) Stephen addressed Jesus by using the expression “Lord Jesus [Greek, <em>Kyʹri·e I·e·souʹ</em>].” In the Christian Greek Scriptures, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> can refer to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, but here the context clarifies that <em>Kyʹri·os</em> refers to Jesus. The Greek word here rendered “he made this appeal” is not the usual word for “praying” in the Christian Greek Scriptures, but it is rendered “prayed” in many Bible translations, giving the impression that Stephen prayed directly to Jesus. However, reliable reference works state that the Greek word used here (<em>e·pi·ka·leʹo</em>) means “to call on; to invoke; to appeal to an authority,” and it is often rendered that way.

Rather, because of this vision, Stephen felt free to make this plea to him.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/7:60$p/E:1001070696/71-71:1808">study note on Ac 7:60</a>.</p>

<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah:</strong> Available Greek manuscripts use the term “Lord” (<em>Kyʹri·os</em>) here. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, this title often refers to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. In this case, the reference is apparently to Jehovah God for the following reasons: Stephen here echoes Jesus’ words to his Father at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:34-42:23:34" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Lu 23:34</a>: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” In Luke’s account of Stephen’s speech, recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:2-44:7:53" data-bid="126-1" class="b">Ac 7:2-53</a>, the term <em>Kyʹri·os</em> is used three times. All three are quotes from or allusions to the Hebrew Scriptures that clearly refer to God. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/7:31$p/E:1001070696/34-34:1035">study notes on Ac 7:31,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/7:33$p/E:1001070696/36-36:399"> 33,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/7:49$p/E:1001070696/55-55:364"> 49</a>.) Many commentators and translators support the view that in these contexts, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> refers to Jehovah. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C</a>.) While the term <em>Kyʹri·os</em> also occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:59-44:7:59" data-bid="127-1" class="b">Ac 7:59</a>, there Stephen specifically says “Lord Jesus.” However, this statement does not mean, as some claim, that Jesus is the one addressed as <em>Kyʹri·os</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:60-44:7:60" data-bid="128-1" class="b">Ac 7:60</a>. There is a natural break between Stephen’s words in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:59-44:7:59" data-bid="129-1" class="b">verse 59</a> and his words in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:60-44:7:60" data-bid="130-1" class="b">verse 60</a>. Stephen had been standing, so when he knelt in front of his enemies, it was likely in order to address Jehovah in prayer. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:41-42:22:41" data-bid="131-1" class="b">Lu 22:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:40-44:9:40" data-bid="131-2" class="b"> Ac 9:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:36-44:20:36" data-bid="131-3" class="b"> 20:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:5-44:21:5" data-bid="131-4" class="b"> 21:5</a>, where kneeling is connected with prayer to God.) Therefore, it seems that Stephen’s last words were a prayer to the almighty God, Jehovah. In addition, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:56-44:7:56" data-bid="132-1" class="b">Ac 7:56</a> says that Stephen saw “the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God’s right hand,” so it is understandable that he would address Jesus in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:59-44:7:59" data-bid="133-1" class="b">verse 59</a> and then Jehovah in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:60-44:7:60" data-bid="134-1" class="b">verse 60</a>.

When these expressions are used in contexts that refer to death, Bible translators often use such wording as “fall asleep in death” or simply “died,” which helps the reader avoid confusion. In the figurative sense, the term “asleep” is applied in the Scriptures to those who have died because of the sin and death passed on from Adam.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/5:39$p/E:1001070633/36-36:477">study notes on Mr 5:39;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/11:11$p/E:1001070679/9-9:490"> Joh 11:11</a>.</p>
