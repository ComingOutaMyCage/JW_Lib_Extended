Located at the northern end of the Aegean Sea, Neapolis served as the port for Philippi, a city that lay a short distance to the northwest. It was at Neapolis that the apostle Paul first entered Europe in response to the call to “step over into Macedonia.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:9-44:16:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 16:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:11-44:16:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) He likely passed through Neapolis again on his third missionary tour. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:2-44:20:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 20:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:6-44:20:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6</a>) There are few remains of the Roman city, but visitors today can travel on some segments of the Roman-built Egnatian Way (<em>Via Egnatia</em>) nearby. That highway was a major west-east route some 800 km (500 mi) long that helped to connect numerous cities in Europe and reached to the border of Asia. A number of the cities visited by Paul were on the Egnatian Way, including Neapolis, Philippi, Amphipolis, Apollonia, and Thessalonica.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:1-44:17:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 17:1</a>.</p>
