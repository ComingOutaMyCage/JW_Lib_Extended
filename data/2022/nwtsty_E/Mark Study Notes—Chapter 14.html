That timing is indicated by the parallel account in John, where Jesus is said to <em>arrive</em> at Bethany “six days before the Passover.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:1-43:12:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joh 12:1</a>) He must have arrived about the beginning (at sunset) of the Sabbath on Nisan 8, which was the day before the meal at Simon’s place.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:2-43:12:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Joh 12:2-11</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070213/">App. A7</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">B12</a>.</p>

He may have been a former leper whom Jesus healed.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/8:2$p/E:1001070608/5-5:288">study note on Mt 8:2</a> and Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="46" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077165/">Leprosy; Leper</a>.”</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>perfumed oil:</strong> John says that the weight was a pound. Mark’s and John’s accounts specify that it was worth “more than 300 denarii.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:5-41:14:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mr 14:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:3-43:12:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Joh 12:3-5</a>) That sum represented about a year’s wages for an ordinary laborer. The source of such perfumed oil is generally thought to be an aromatic plant (<em>Nardostachys jatamansi</em>) found in the Himalayas. Nard was often adulterated, even counterfeited, but both Mark and John say that this oil was <strong>genuine nard.</strong>​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="88" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077205/">Nard</a>.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>pouring it on his head:</strong> According to Matthew and Mark, the woman poured the oil on Jesus’ head. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:7-40:26:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mt 26:7</a>) John, who wrote years later, supplied the added detail that she also poured it on his feet. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:3-43:12:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Joh 12:3</a>) Jesus explains that this loving act, in a figurative sense, prepared him for burial.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/14:8$p/E:1001070642/15-15:294">study note on Mr 14:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>300 denarii:</strong> Matthew’s account simply says “a great deal of money” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:9-40:26:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mt 26:9</a>), but the accounts of Mark and John are more specific.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/14:3$p/E:1001070642/10-10:474">study note on Mr 14:3</a>; Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="67" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077082/">Denarius</a>”; and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070236/">App. B14</a>.</p>

He explained that she was unknowingly preparing his body for <strong>burial,</strong> since such perfumed oil and ointments were often applied to dead bodies.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:14-14:16:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2Ch 16:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>silver money:</strong> Lit., “silver,” that is, silver used as money. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:15-40:26:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mt 26:15</a>, the amount of money was “30 silver pieces.” Matthew is the only Gospel writer to mention the amount for which Jesus was betrayed. These were possibly 30 silver shekels minted in Tyre. The use of this sum appears to show the chief priests’ contempt for Jesus, since under the Law, it was the price of a slave. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:32-2:21:32" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ex 21:32</a>) Likewise, when the prophet Zechariah asked the unfaithful Israelites for his wages for his prophetic work among God’s people, they weighed out to him “30 pieces of silver,” suggesting that they considered him to be worth no more than a slave.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:12-38:11:13" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Zec 11:12, 13</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>on the first day of the Unleavened Bread:</strong> The Festival of Unleavened Bread began on Nisan 15, the day after the Passover (Nisan 14), and the festival lasted for seven days. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070237/">App. B15</a>.) By Jesus’ time, however, the Passover had become so closely connected to this festival that all eight days, including Nisan 14, were sometimes referred to as “the Festival of the Unleavened Bread.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:1-42:22:1" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Lu 22:1</a>) The day mentioned here refers to Nisan 14 because it is said to be the day <strong>when they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice.</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex 12:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:15-2:12:15" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:17-2:12:18" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:5-3:23:5" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> Le 23:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:1-5:16:8" data-bid="27-5" class="b"> De 16:1-8</a>) What is described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:12-41:14:16" data-bid="28-1" class="b">verses 12-16</a> likely took place on the afternoon of Nisan 13 in preparation for the Passover, which was celebrated “after evening had fallen” at the beginning of Nisan 14.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:17-41:14:18" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mr 14:17, 18</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070233/">App. B12</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/26:17$p/E:1001070626/37-37:934">study note on Mt 26:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>dipping with me:</strong> People usually ate food with their fingers, or they used a piece of bread somewhat like a spoon. This expression could also be an idiom meaning “to share food together.” Eating with a person signified close friendship. To turn against such an intimate companion was considered the vilest form of treachery.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:9-19:41:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps 41:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:18-43:13:18" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Joh 13:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="s5"><strong>keep on the watch:</strong> Lit., “stay awake.” Jesus had emphasized the need for his disciples to stay awake spiritually because of not knowing the day and hour of his coming. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:42$p/E:1001070624/78-78:277">study notes on Mt 24:42;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/25:13$p/E:1001070625/10-10:173"> 25:13;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/13:35$p/E:1001070641/52-52:258"> Mr 13:35</a>.)

Similar exhortations are found throughout the Christian Greek Scriptures, showing that spiritual alertness is vital for true Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:13-46:16:13" data-bid="42-1" class="b">1Co 16:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:2-51:4:2" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Col 4:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:6-52:5:6" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 1Th 5:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 1Pe 5:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:15-66:16:15" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> Re 16:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="s5"><strong>fell to the ground:</strong> Or “threw himself to the ground.” The parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:39-40:26:39" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Mt 26:39</a> says that Jesus “fell facedown.” In the Bible, several postures for prayer are mentioned, including standing and kneeling. However, perhaps the humblest posture was when a person in fervent prayer would lie facedown with his body outstretched.</p>

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="s5"><strong><em>Abba:</em></strong> A Hebrew or Aramaic word (transliterated into Greek) occurring three times in the Christian Greek Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:15-45:8:15" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ro 8:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:6-48:4:6" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> Ga 4:6</a>) The word literally means “the father” or “O Father.” It combines some of the intimacy of the English word “papa” with the dignity of the word “father,” being informal and yet respectful. It was among the first words a child learned to speak; yet in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic writings, it was also used by a grown son when addressing his father. Therefore, it was an endearing form of address rather than a title. Jesus’ use of this expression shows the close, trusting relationship he has with his Father.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="s5"><strong>Father:</strong> All three instances of <em>Abba</em> are followed by the translation <em>ho pa·terʹ</em> in Greek, which literally means “the father” or “O Father.”</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="s5"><strong>remove this cup from me:</strong> In the Bible, “cup” is often used figuratively of God’s will, or the “assigned portion,” for a person. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/20:22$p/E:1001070620/31-31:357">study note on Mt 20:22</a>.) Jesus no doubt felt great concern over the reproach that his death as one charged with blasphemy and sedition could bring on God, moving him to pray that this “cup” be removed from him.</p>
