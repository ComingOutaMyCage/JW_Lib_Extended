<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">This picture represents two of the types of helmets used by Roman soldiers in the first century. Such helmets were made of either bronze or iron. They were bowl-shaped and had a neck guard; hinged pieces covered the cheeks. Most helmets also had a brow guard to deflect blows directed toward the soldier’s face. All helmets included a lining and were usually padded to enable a soldier to wear them for long periods of time. Apparently, soldiers had to buy their own armor, including the helmet. Paul used a helmet to illustrate a vital source of protection. Just as a helmet protected a soldier’s head from life-threatening blows, “the hope of salvation” can protect a Christian’s thinking ability and future life prospects.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:8-52:5:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Th 5:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:2-56:1:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Tit 1:2</a>.</p>
