<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>dropsy:</strong> Or “edema,” an excess buildup of fluid in the body, evidenced by swelling. The term was used by ancient physicians from Hippocrates, a Greek physician of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E., onward. Dropsy, which may have been a symptom of advanced deterioration of the body’s vital organs, was dreaded because it often indicated that the person would suffer a sudden death. Some believe that the man was brought to Jesus on the Sabbath as a trap by the Pharisees, for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:1-42:14:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">verse 1</a> says: “They were closely watching him.” This is one of at least six miracles that are mentioned only in Luke’s Gospel.​—See “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070046/">Introduction to Luke</a>.”</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>most prominent places:</strong> At feasts or banquets in Jesus’ day, guests reclined on couches placed along three sides of a table. Servers had access to the fourth side. The number of couches may have varied, depending on the size of the table. Four or five people could occupy one couch, but usually the number was three. Each person would recline with his head near the table, resting his left elbow on a cushion, and taking food with his right hand. The customary three places on the couch indicated the high, middle, and low location of the guests.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>dines:</strong> Or “is at the feast.” Lit., “eats bread.” In Bible times, bread was such an important part of the diet that in both Hebrew and Greek, the expression “to eat bread” means “to eat (a meal); to dine.” The Hebrew term for “eat bread” has often been rendered “eat” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:25-1:37:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 37:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:8-12:4:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2Ki 4:8</a>), “dine” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:9:7-10:9:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Sa 9:7</a>), or “eat . . . food” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:7-21:9:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ec 9:7</a>). Similarly, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:1-42:14:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lu 14:1</a>, the Greek expression rendered “eat a meal” is literally “eat bread.”</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>hate:</strong> In the Bible, the term “hate” has several shades of meaning. It may denote a feeling of hostility that is motivated by malice, prompting someone to harm others. Or it may refer to an intense feeling of dislike for or strong aversion to someone or something, thus causing a person to avoid having anything to do with that person or thing. Or the term may simply mean to love to a lesser degree. For example, when Jacob is said to have “hated” Leah and loved Rachel, the meaning is that he loved Leah less than he loved Rachel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:29:31-1:29:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 29:31</a>, ftn.; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:15-5:21:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">De 21:15</a>, ftn.), and the term is used in this sense in other ancient Jewish literature. Therefore, Jesus did not mean that his followers were to feel hostility or loathing toward their families and toward themselves, as this would contradict the rest of the Scriptures. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:29-41:12:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mr 12:29-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:29" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Eph 5:28, 29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 33</a>.) In this context, the term “hate” could be rendered “love to a lesser degree.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>life:</strong> Or “soul.” The meaning of the Greek word <em>psy·kheʹ,</em> traditionally rendered “soul,” has to be determined by the context. Here it refers to a person’s life. Thus, Jesus’ words mean that a true disciple must love Jesus more than he loves his own life, even being willing to lose his life if necessary.​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077299/">Soul</a>.”</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>torture stake:</strong> Or “execution stake.” In classical Greek, the word <em>stau·rosʹ</em> primarily referred to an upright stake or pole. Used figuratively in the Scriptures, this term often stands for the suffering, shame, torture, and even death that a person experienced because of being a follower of Jesus. This is the third time that Jesus said that his disciples would have to carry a torture stake; the two earlier occasions are recorded at (1) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:38-40:10:38" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mt 10:38</a>; (2) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mt 16:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:34-41:8:34" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Mr 8:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:23-42:9:23" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Lu 9:23</a>.​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="52" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077328/">Glossary</a>.</p>
