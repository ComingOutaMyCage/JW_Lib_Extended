<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">The Bible contains many references to fish, fishing, and fishermen in connection with the Sea of Galilee. About 18 species of fish live in the Sea of Galilee. Of that number, only about ten have been sought by fishermen. These ten can be divided into three commercially important groups. One group is the binny, also known as the barbel (<em>Barbus longiceps</em> is shown) (1). Its three species display barbs at the corners of the mouth; hence, its Semitic name <em>biny,</em> meaning “hair.” It feeds on mollusks, snails, and small fish. The longheaded barbel reaches a length of 75 cm (30 in.) and can weigh over 7 kg (15 lb). The second group is called musht (<em>Tilapia galilea</em> is shown) (2), which means “comb” in Arabic, because its five species display a comblike dorsal fin. One variety of musht reaches a length of about 45 cm (18 in.) and can weigh some 2 kg (4.5 lb). The third group is the Kinneret sardine (<em>Acanthobrama terrae sanctae</em> is shown) (3), which resembles a small herring. From ancient times, this fish has been preserved by pickling.</p>
