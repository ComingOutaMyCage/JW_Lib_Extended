<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of May 23, 2022, 6.27 million people have died as a result of COVID-19. However, in a news release published on May 5, 2022, the WHO estimated the number of deaths to be far greater. It noted that during 2020 and 2021, “the full death toll associated directly or indirectly with the COVID-19 pandemic . . . was approximately 14.9 million.” Does the Bible say anything about such heartbreaking tragedies?</p>
