<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect people globally, you may agree with her words. But what does “normal” mean? What are people hoping to do?</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Resume their former lives.</strong> Some long for a more social life, one with hugs and handshakes as well as opportunities to travel. They feel that “getting back to a degree of normality” involves “restaurants, theaters, [and] that kind of thing,” as Dr. Anthony Fauci<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> put it.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Improve their lives.</strong> Some see a chance for a “new normal,” that is better than the life they had before. They feel that this world of demanding jobs, social inequalities, and deteriorating mental health must change. “The pandemic,” says founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, “represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Others have been so devastated by the pandemic that hope for a “normal” life seems far-fetched. For example, many have lost their job, their home, their good health or, worse yet, their loved ones in death.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Of course, no one can predict exactly how the post-pandemic world will turn out. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>) However, the Bible can help us manage our expectations and cope with unfolding events. What is more, the Bible points to a future that we can be certain of, one that you may not have expected.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Long ago, the Bible foretold that widespread diseases or “pestilences” would occur during “the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:3</a>) When we consider the COVID-19 pandemic from that perspective, we see it as one of the many noteworthy events—including wars, great earthquakes, and food shortages—that we are told to expect in fulfillment of Bible prophecy.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>How knowing this helps:</strong> While current pandemic conditions may improve, the Bible warns that we are living in “critical times hard to deal with.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) Knowing this can help us manage our expectations about life in these challenging times.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>The Bible foretold not only the serious problems we now face but also the better times we can expect soon. It describes a future that is way beyond what human governments could hope to achieve, one that only God can provide. “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>

I am making all things new.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:5-66:21:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 21:5</a>) He will solve this world’s problems, including those made worse by the pandemic. He will provide the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  Perfect physical and mental health, with no more sickness and death.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:8-23:25:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 33:24</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  Satisfying work that brings real contentment, not demanding jobs that lead to frustration or burnout.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:22-23:65:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:22, 23</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  Prosperity for everyone, ensuring an end to poverty and hunger.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:12-19:72:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 72:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 145:16</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  Recovery from emotional trauma, along with the prospect of seeing dead loved ones brought back to life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>How knowing this helps:</strong> The Bible says: “We have this hope as an anchor for our lives.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:6:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:19</a>, footnote) Such hope of better things ahead can stabilize us. It can help us to cope with today’s difficult situations, to reduce anxiety, and to keep our emotional balance.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="36"></span>Jehovah’s Witnesses take comfort in the Bible’s promises of a bright future, and this helps them to see beyond the pandemic. They also support one another by obeying the Bible’s command to gather regularly for worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) Everyone is welcome to attend the <a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=1011229&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E">meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses</a>, which are being held virtually during the pandemic.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"></span>Others agree that joining together with Jehovah’s Witnesses for worship has been helpful during these difficult times. For example, a woman infected with COVID-19 accepted an invitation to join Jehovah’s Witnesses’ virtual meetings. These meetings helped her emotionally despite her ongoing health issues from the virus. She later said: “I feel that I am part of this family too. Reading the Bible gives me peace of mind and inner calm. It helps me focus on my hope for the future instead of my problems. Thank you for helping me find that connection with God that I have sought all my life.”</p>
