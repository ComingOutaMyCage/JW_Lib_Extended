This Bible-reading schedule helps you to read the Bible books in the order they appear or to take a topical approach. For example, you can read selected portions to get a historical overview of God’s dealings with ancient Israel. You can read other portions to learn how the first-century Christian congregation started and grew. If you read one set of chapters each day, you will have read the entire Bible in a year.</p>
