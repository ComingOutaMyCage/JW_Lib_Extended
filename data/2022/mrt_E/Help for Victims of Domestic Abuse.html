<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“Violence against women is a global public health problem of epidemic proportion, requiring urgent action,” says the World Health Organization. That organization estimates that almost 30 percent “of all women who have been in a relationship have experienced physical and/or sexual violence” by their partner. And a UN report estimates that in one recent year, 137 women died each day around the world at the hands of their partner or another family member.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Remember this:</strong> Your abuser is responsible for his actions.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>If your partner blames <em>you</em> for the abuse <em>he</em> inflicts, he is wrong. Wives deserve to be loved, not abused.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:19-51:3:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>At times, an abuser’s actions may be influenced by a personality disorder, his family background, or the misuse of alcohol. Even so, he is accountable to God for the way he treats you. And he is responsible to do what it takes to change his actions.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Why may you need help from others? Domestic abuse is a complex situation. When deciding how to deal with it, you may struggle to weigh factors that seem to compete with each other, such as:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  Your personal safety</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  The well-being of your children</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42"><strong>Listen empathetically.</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 1:19</a>) Tell her that you are willing to listen, but do not push her to talk. Reassure her that you believe what she says.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:5-20:20:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43">One domestic violence resource says: “It will have taken a lot for her to talk to you. [Victims] are much more likely to cover up or downplay the abuse, rather than to make it up or exaggerate. You might find it hard to imagine someone you know could behave abusively. But the person who is abusive will probably show you a very different side [from] the side the victim sees.”</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44"><strong>Speak encouragingly.</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>) Use your words to build her self-worth. Tell her that you care about her. Remind her of her good qualities. And encourage her to get help.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45"><strong>Offer support.</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>) Give her practical assistance, such as watching her children for a short time or providing a meal. Verify that she has a safety plan, including a place to go in case of an emergency.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46"><strong>Build up her confidence in her ability to make her own decisions.</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5</a>) Provide her with information, and talk about possible options.
