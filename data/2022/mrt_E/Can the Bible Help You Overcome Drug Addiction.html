<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Researchers have found that addiction is often associated with such deep-seated issues as loneliness, stress, anxiety, and depression. The Bible can help you to build the faith needed to cope successfully with the challenges that may contribute to addiction. It shows how you can have a close friendship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:14-19:25:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 25:14</a>) With his help, you can overcome problems that might seem impossible to solve on your own.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:22-41:11:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 11:22-24</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>No. The Bible acknowledges: “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:12-40:9:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 9:12</a>) Likewise, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse says: “Drug addiction is a complex disease, and quitting usually takes more than good intentions or a strong will.” Of course, the help that God provides is far stronger than anyone’s willpower. Still, many who have broken free from substance addiction by following the Bible’s counsel also needed the help of medical treatment.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> For instance, a man named Allen recalls: “When I was giving up alcohol, the physical pain of withdrawal was tremendous.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>No. In fact, the Bible describes the use of <a class="xt" data-xtid="131" href="jwpub://p/E:502015240/">alcohol</a> to treat illness or to dull the pain of someone who is about to die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:6-20:31:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:23-54:5:23" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 5:23</a>) However, just as is true of alcohol, drugs that are used to manage pain can be highly addictive. Thus, it is wise to see the potential danger and exercise caution in the use of prescription painkillers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>.</p>
