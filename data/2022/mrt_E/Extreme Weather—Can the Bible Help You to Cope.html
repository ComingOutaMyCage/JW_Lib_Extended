<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Are you one of the millions who have been affected by extreme weather? Dangerous weather and its damaging effects come in many forms. Hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes often cause storm surges, flooding, or wind damage. Heavy rain may trigger landslides, and storms can bring lightning strikes that start destructive wildfires. Droughts, heat waves, and winter storms can be equally devastating.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>In many areas of the world, catastrophic weather is becoming increasingly frequent and intense. “The number of people affected by disasters also continues to rise,” reports the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, “as more and more floods, storms and droughts in particular wreak havoc on lives and livelihoods, displacing millions of people each year.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>In the wake of such events, people suffer not only physically but also emotionally. They may face the trauma of having lost their possessions, their home, or even a loved one in death.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>If you have suffered the effects of extreme weather, the Bible can help you to cope. It provides comfort, hope, and practical advice, which have helped countless victims of weather-related disasters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) It also answers an important question that plagues many: Why did God allow this to happen—is he punishing me?</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Today’s extreme weather is not punishment from God</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The Bible teaches that God is not responsible for the suffering that people experience. It assures us that “with evil things God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:13-59:1:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 1:13</a>) This means that he is not behind the extreme weather people are experiencing today.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The Bible does record occasions when God used natural forces to punish wicked people. But those events were unlike destructive weather today, which comes without warning and strikes the good as well as the bad. In contrast, the Bible accounts show that God always protected the innocent, gave advance warning, and explained the reasons for his actions. For example, God explained why he was bringing the global Flood in Noah’s day, provided advance warning before he did so, and protected Noah and his family.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:13-1:6:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>To learn more about how we know that today’s natural disasters are not punishment from God, see the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="122" href="jwpub://p/E:502019177/">What Does the Bible Say About Natural Disasters?</a>”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The Bible reveals that Jehovah<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> God is caring and empathetic. Consider the following comforting verses.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:9-23:63:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 63:9</strong></a><strong>:</strong> “During all their distress it was distressing to [God].”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> Jehovah is deeply affected by the distress of those who suffer.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>The Bible reveals Jehovah’s promise “to give you a future and a hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:11</a>) He intends for people to enjoy life on a paradise earth, not to live in fear of its weather.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:18-23:32:18" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Isaiah 32:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>God will bring about that future by means of his Kingdom, a heavenly government headed by Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>) Jesus has both the wisdom and the power needed to prevent weather disasters. When Jesus was on earth, he demonstrated his power to control the weather. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:37-41:4:41" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mark 4:37-41</a>) He will rule with understanding and wisdom, teaching humans how to care for the environment and live in harmony with nature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:2-23:11:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:2</a>) Under Jesus’ leadership, people will never again be harmed by extreme weather.</p>
