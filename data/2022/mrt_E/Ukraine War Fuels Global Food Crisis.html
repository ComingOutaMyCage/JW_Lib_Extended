<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>On May 19, 2022, the United Nations Security Council heard from more than 75 high-level officials that “a global food crisis, already impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, is being driven to famine levels worldwide by the war in Ukraine.” Soon after, <em>The Economist</em> declared that the “war is tipping a fragile world towards mass hunger.” The Bible predicted that such food crises would happen in our time, yet it also provides help for us to cope with them.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  Jesus prophesied: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and <em>there will be food shortages.”</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  The Bible book of Revelation describes four symbolic horsemen. One of those horsemen represents warfare. He is followed by another who represents famine, a time when food would be rationed and sold at exorbitant prices. “I saw a black horse, and its rider had a balance scale in one hand. I heard what sounded like a voice . . . It said, ‘A quart of wheat will cost you a whole day’s wages! Three quarts of barley will cost you a day’s wages too.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:5-66:6:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 6:5, 6</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>These Bible prophecies about food crises are being fulfilled now in the time that the Bible calls “the last days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) To learn more about “the last days” and the ride of the four horsemen of Revelation, watch the video <a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?lank=pub-lffv_322_VIDEO&amp;wtlocale=E" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=lffv&amp;track=322"><em>The World Has Changed Since 1914</em></a> and read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="78" href="jwpub://p/E:2017086/">The Four Horsemen—Who Are They?</a>”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  The Bible <strong>contains practical advice</strong> that can help us cope with challenging circumstances, including rising food prices or even food shortages. See some examples in the article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:501100008/">How to Live on Less</a>.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  The Bible also <strong>gives us hope</strong> that things will get better. It promises a time when “there will be an abundance of grain on the earth” and everyone will have plenty to eat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 72:16</a>) To learn more about the Bible’s hope for the future and why you can trust it, read the article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:501100017/">A Real Hope for a Better Tomorrow</a>.”</p>
