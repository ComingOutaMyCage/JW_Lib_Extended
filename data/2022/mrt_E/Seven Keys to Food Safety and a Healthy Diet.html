<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Your health depends, in part, on what you eat. If you maintain food safety and a healthy diet, you can improve your health. In contrast, unsafe food practices and unwholesome food lead to serious health problems, just as poor-quality fuel can lead to car problems. They may not appear immediately, but they <em>will</em> come.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The World Health Organization (WHO) states that “every country in the world is affected by one or more forms of malnutrition”—a term that includes not only undernutrition but also conditions such as overweight and obesity. Frequently consuming unwholesome food or drink increases your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. According to one study, poor nutrition led to at least 11 million deaths in one recent year. WHO estimates that contaminated food kills more than a thousand people every day and leads to health problems for hundreds of millions.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible encourages us to take these issues seriously. It teaches that God is “the source of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>) Life is a gift, and we show appreciation for it by caring for our health and that of our families. Consider how you can do that.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  Cook food until it is <em>very</em> hot. Food, including the innermost portions of meat, must reach 70 degrees Celsius (160°F) for at least 30 seconds.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Why?</strong> If food is stored at a temperature between 5 and 60 degrees Celsius (40–140°F) for just 20 minutes, the number of bacteria in it can double. Further, if raw meat is not stored at safe temperatures, some bacteria can produce toxins that are not destroyed by cooking.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>  Keep food hot or cold, not lukewarm, to slow or stop germs from multiplying.</p>
</li>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>2. Eat only moderate amounts of fats and oils.</strong></p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span>WHO recommends that you limit your intake of fried foods and processed or commercially baked foods, which often contain unhealthy fats.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span>WHO recommends that adults restrict their total daily intake of salt to less than one teaspoonful.

For example, an average 355-milliliter (12 fl oz) soft drink contains up to 50 milliliters (10 teaspoons) of sugar. While soft drinks contain many calories, they provide little or no nutritional value.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span>The Bible says: “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>) If you act shrewdly in your eating habits and make any necessary changes, you show appreciation to God for your life and health.</p>
