<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Many experts are confident that humans can protect the earth and live in harmony with nature. Some researchers argue that for human efforts to succeed, changes must be made in a number of areas and at the same time. Such changes would include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Improving how land, forests, wetlands, and oceans are managed.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  Adopting different agricultural practices and energy sources.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Switching to a food system that supports a primarily plant-based diet that includes a moderate intake of meat and fish and reduces overall consumption and waste.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Accepting that a good quality of life does not depend on having ever more material things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>What do you think?</strong> Is it realistic to expect governments, businesses, and individuals to cooperate on such an unprecedented scale? Or do you think it is more likely that deep-seated greed, selfishness, and shortsightedness displayed by some would stand in the way?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>A reason for hope</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>The Bible gives us assurance that the future of our planet is secure. It explains why human efforts are not enough to save the earth, and it describes the real change that must be made. It also identifies how this change will come about.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Why human effort alone will not save the planet.</strong> Jehovah<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> God created the earth, and he assigned humans the responsibility of caring for it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:15</a>) They could succeed in their assignment only if they looked to their Creator for guidance and obeyed his instructions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:24-20:20:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:24</a>) Instead, however, they rejected Jehovah and pursued an independent course. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:29-21:7:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:29</a>) On their own, humans do not have the ability to care for the earth, and any effort they make will have limited success at best.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:30-20:21:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 10:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>The change that must be made.</strong> God intends to stop humans from ruining the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 11:18</a>) He will not reform the governments and earthly society that are harming the planet; he will replace them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1</a>) For this reason, Jehovah declares: “Look! I am making all things new.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:5-66:21:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 21:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>How that change will come about.</strong> Jehovah will replace human governments with a heavenly one called the Kingdom of God. That government, under the leadership of Jesus Christ, will then administer earth’s affairs.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>God’s Kingdom will educate humans to live by God’s righteous standards. When humans recognize their Creator and heed his guidance, they will be able to live in harmony with the natural world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9</a>) The Bible describes how God’s government will enable its citizens to enjoy an excellent quality of life, one that is sustainable for the planet. It will do the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  Provide food for all.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 72:16</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  Restore natural resources.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:6-23:35:7" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 6, 7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  Ensure a balanced relationship between humans and animals.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:18-28:2:18" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Hosea 2:18</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  Prevent environmental catastrophes.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:37-41:4:41" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 4:37-41</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>You can expect that God’s Kingdom will soon bring about these changes. For more information, read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="108" href="jwpub://p/E:2020087/">When Will God’s Kingdom Rule the Earth?</a>”</p>
