TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
How Our Opposers Try to Weaken Us




Our opposers try to discourage us by lying about those taking the lead (2Ki 18:19-21; w05 8/1 11 ¶5)
They try to mislead us by misrepresenting Jehovah or the organization (2Ki 18:22, 25; w10 7/15 13 ¶3)
They try to tempt us by making false promises (2Ki 18:31, 32; w13 11/15 19 ¶14; yb74 177 ¶1)
ASK YOURSELF, ‘What steps can I take now to strengthen myself for persecution?’
