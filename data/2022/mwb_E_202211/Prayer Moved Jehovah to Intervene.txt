TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Prayer Moved Jehovah to Intervene




Jehovah told Hezekiah that he would not recover from his sickness (2Ki 20:1; ip-1 394 ¶23)
Faithful Hezekiah supplicated Jehovah (2Ki 20:2, 3; w17.03 21 ¶16)
Hezekiah’s prayers moved Jehovah to intervene (2Ki 20:4-6; g01 7/22 13 ¶4)
Our prayers may move Jehovah to do what he might not have done otherwise. How does this account motivate you to persist in prayer?
