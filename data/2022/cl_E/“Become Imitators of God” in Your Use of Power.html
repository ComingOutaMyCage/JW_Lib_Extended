<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 1. To what insidious snare do imperfect humans easily fall prey?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“NEVER a power without the lurk of a subtle snare.” Those words of a 19th-century poet call attention to an insidious danger: the misuse of power. Sadly, imperfect humans all too easily fall prey to this snare. Indeed, throughout history “man has dominated man to his harm.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a>) The exercise of power without love has resulted in untold human suffering.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">2, 3. (a) What is remarkable about Jehovah’s use of power? (b) What may our power include, and how should we use all such power?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Is it not remarkable, though, that Jehovah God, who has unlimited power, <em>never</em> misuses that power? As we have noted in the preceding chapters, he always uses his power​—whether creative, destructive, protective, or restorative—​in harmony with his loving purposes. When we contemplate the way he exerts his power, we are moved to draw close to him. That, in turn, can motivate us to “become imitators of God” in our own use of power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1</a>) But what power do we puny humans possess?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Remember that man was created “in God’s image” and likeness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26, 27</a>) Hence, we too have power​—at least a measure of it. Our power may include the capacity to accomplish things, to work; the possession of control or authority over others; the ability to influence others, particularly those who love us; physical strength (might); or material resources. Concerning Jehovah, the psalmist said: “With you is the source of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>) Therefore, directly or indirectly, God is the Source of any <span id="page98" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="98" data-before-text="98"></span>legitimate power we might have. We therefore want to use it in ways that please him. How can we do so?</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The key to using power aright is love. Does not God’s own example demonstrate this? Recall the discussion of God’s four cardinal attributes​—power, justice, wisdom, and love—​in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102002022/">Chapter 1</a>. Of the four qualities, which one predominates? Love. “God is love,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>. Yes, Jehovah’s very essence is love; it influences all that he does. So every expression of his power is motivated by love and is ultimately for the good of those who love him.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Love will also help us to use our power aright. After all, the Bible tells us that love is “kind” and “does not look for its own interests.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4, 5</a>) Hence, love will not allow us to act in a harsh or cruel manner toward those over whom we have a measure of authority. Instead, we will treat others with dignity and put their needs and feelings ahead of our own.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Philippians 2:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">6, 7. (a) What is godly fear, and why will this quality help us to avoid misusing power? (b) Illustrate the connection between fear of displeasing God and love for God.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Love is related to another quality that can help us to avoid misusing power: godly fear. What is the value of this quality? “By fearing Jehovah one turns away from bad,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:6-20:16:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:6</a>. The misuse of power is certainly among the bad ways from which we should turn away. Fear of God will restrain us from mistreating those over whom we have power. Why? For one thing, we know that we are accountable to God for the way we treat such ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:1-16:5:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Nehemiah 5:1-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:15-16:5:15" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15</a>) But godly fear involves more <span id="page99" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="99" data-before-text="99"></span>than that. The original-language terms used for “fear” often refer to a profound reverence and awe of God. The Bible thus associates fear with love for God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:12-5:10:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:12, 13</a>) This reverential awe includes a healthy fear of displeasing God​—not simply because we fear the consequences but because we truly love him.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> To illustrate: Think about the wholesome relationship between a little boy and his father. The boy senses his father’s warm, loving interest in him. But the boy is also aware of what his father requires of him, and he knows that his father will discipline him if he misbehaves. The boy does not live in morbid fear of his father. On the contrary, he dearly loves his father. The youngster delights in doing what will bring his father’s smile of approval. So it is with godly fear. Because we love Jehovah, our heavenly Father, we dread doing anything that would sadden his heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:6-1:6:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 6:6</a>) Rather, we long to make his heart rejoice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>) That is why we want to use our power aright. Let us take a closer look at how we may do so.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 8. (a) What authority do husbands have in the family, and how is it to be exercised? (b) How can a husband demonstrate that he honors his wife?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Consider first the family circle. “A husband is head of his wife,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:23-49:5:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:23</a>. How is a husband to exercise this God-given authority? The Bible tells husbands to dwell with their wives “according to knowledge” and to “assign them honor as to a weaker vessel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:7</a>) The Greek noun rendered “honor” means “price, value, . . . respect.” Forms of this word are translated “gifts” and “precious.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:10-44:28:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 28:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:7-60:2:7" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:7</a>) A husband who honors his wife would never assault her physically; neither <span id="page100" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="100" data-before-text="100"></span>would he humiliate or disparage her, causing her to feel worthless. Rather, he recognizes her value and treats her with respect. He shows by his words and deeds​—in private and in public—​that she is precious to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:28-20:31:28" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:28</a>) Such a husband gains not only his wife’s love and respect but, more important, God’s approval.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Wives too have a measure of power in the family. The Bible tells of godly women who, within the framework of proper headship, took the initiative to influence their husbands in a positive way or to help them avoid errors in judgment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:9-1:21:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 21:9-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:46-1:28:2" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 27:46–28:2</a>) A wife may have a keener mind than her husband has, or she may have other abilities that he does not have. Yet, she is to have “deep respect” for her husband and to “be in subjection” to him “as to the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 33</a>) Thinking in terms of pleasing God can help a wife to use her abilities to support her husband rather than belittle him or try to dominate him. Such a “truly wise woman” cooperates closely with her husband to build up the family. She thereby maintains peace with God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:1-20:14:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">10. (a) God has granted what authority to parents? (b) What is the meaning of the word “discipline,” and how should it be administered? (See also footnote.)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Parents also have authority granted them by God. The Bible admonishes: “Fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>) In the Bible, the word “discipline” can mean “upbringing, training, instruction.” Children need discipline; they thrive under clear-cut guidelines, boundaries, and limits. The Bible associates such discipline, or instruction, with love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:24-20:13:24" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:24</a>) Therefore, “the rod of discipline” should never <span id="page101" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="101" data-before-text="101"></span>be abusive​—emotionally or physically.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:15-20:22:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:15-20:29:15" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 29:15</a>) Discipline that is rigid or harsh with no sense of love is an abuse of parental authority and can crush a child’s spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:21-51:3:21" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Colossians 3:21</a>) On the other hand, balanced discipline that is properly administered conveys to children that their parents love them and care about the kind of person they are becoming.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:17</a>) These qualified men are to use their God-given authority to provide needed assistance and to contribute to the welfare of the flock. Does their position entitle elders to lord it over their fellow believers? Not at all! Elders need to have a balanced, humble view of their role in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:3" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:2, 3</a>) The Bible tells overseers: “Shepherd the congregation <span id="page102" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 20:28</a>) Therein lies a powerful reason for treating each member of the flock with tenderness.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> We might illustrate it this way. A close friend asks you to care for a cherished possession. You know that your friend paid a high price for the item. Would you not treat it delicately, with great care? Similarly, God has entrusted elders with the responsibility to care for a truly valued possession: the congregation, whose members are likened to sheep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:16-43:21:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 21:16, 17</a>) Jehovah’s sheep are dear to him​—so dear, in fact, that he purchased them with the precious blood of his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ. Jehovah could not have paid a higher price for his sheep. Humble elders keep that in mind and treat Jehovah’s sheep accordingly.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:21-20:18:21" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:21</a>) Indeed, the tongue can do much damage. Who of us has never felt the sting of a thoughtless or even disparaging remark? But the tongue also has the power to mend. “The tongue of the wise is a healing,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:18-20:12:18" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:18</a>.

A thoughtful tongue can reassure older ones that they are valued and appreciated. Is someone struggling with a chronic illness?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:22-51:3:22" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Colossians 3:22</a>) Hence, Jesus evidently mentioned these other faculties in order to emphasize that we must not hold anything back in our service to God.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:10-45:14:12" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Romans 14:10-12</a>) Rather, we want to use our power to encourage others.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> Jehovah has set the perfect example in using his power aright. We want to imitate him to the best of our ability as imperfect humans. We can use our power aright by treating with dignity those over whom we have a measure of authority. In addition, we want to be whole-souled in carrying out the lifesaving preaching work that Jehovah has given us to accomplish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:14" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Romans 10:13, 14</a>) Remember, Jehovah is pleased when you give the best that you​—your soul—​can give. Does not your heart move you to want to do all you can in serving such an understanding and loving God? There is no better or more important way to use your power.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:4-19:23:4" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 23:4</a>) Similarly, “the rod” of parental authority suggests loving guidance, not harsh or brutal punishment.</p></div>
