<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IMAGINE being trapped on a sinking ship. Just when you think that there is no hope, a rescuer arrives and pulls you to safety. How relieved you feel as your rescuer takes you away from the danger and says: “You are safe now”! Would you not feel indebted to that person? In a very real sense, you would owe him your life.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> In some respects, this illustrates what Jehovah has done for us. Surely we are indebted to him. After all, he has provided the ransom, making it possible for us to be rescued from the clutches of sin and death. We feel safe knowing that as long as we exercise faith in that precious sacrifice, our sins are forgiven, and our eternal future is secure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:7-62:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4:9</a>) As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102002037/">Chapter 14</a>, the ransom is a supreme expression of Jehovah’s love and justice.

Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, and to walk in modesty with your God!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>) Notice that one of the things Jehovah asks back from us is that we “exercise justice.” How can we do so?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>) Recall that Jehovah “loves righteous acts.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:7-19:11:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 11:7</a>) If we are truly to imitate divine justice, or righteousness, we must come to love what Jehovah loves and hate what he hates.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> It is not easy for imperfect humans to pursue righteousness.

At the same time, we must never give up, feeling that our shortcomings make us unfit to serve Jehovah. Our gracious God has made provision to restore sincerely repentant ones to his favor. Consider the reassuring words of the apostle John: “I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin.” But then he realistically added: “Yet, if anyone does commit a sin [because of inherited imperfection], we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 John 2:1</a>) Yes, Jehovah has provided Jesus’ ransom sacrifice so that we might acceptably serve Him in spite of our sinful nature.

In his prophecy about what would take place during the time of the end, Jesus said: “In all the nations, the good news has to be preached first.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mark 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:3</a>) The use of the word “first” implies that other events will follow the worldwide preaching work. Those events include the foretold great tribulation, which will mean destruction for the wicked and will pave the way for a righteous new world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:22" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 21, 22</a>) Certainly, no one can rightly charge Jehovah with being unjust toward the wicked.

First of all, it is only right that we do what we can to help others gain salvation. Consider again the illustration of being rescued from a sinking ship. Safe in a lifeboat, you would surely want to help others who are still in the water. Similarly, we have an obligation toward those who are still struggling in the “waters” of this wicked world. True, many reject our message. But as long as Jehovah continues to be patient, we have the responsibility to give them the opportunity to “attain to repentance” and thus come in line for salvation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> We can also exercise justice by treating others the way Jehovah treats us. It is all too easy to sit in judgment of others, criticizing their faults and questioning their motives. But who of us would want Jehovah to scrutinize our motives and shortcomings in a merciless manner? That is not how Jehovah deals with us. The psalmist observed: <span id="page162" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="162" data-before-text="162"></span>“If errors were what you watch, O Jah, then who, O Jehovah, could stand?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:3-19:130:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 130:3</a>) Are we not grateful that our just and merciful God chooses not to dwell on our failings?

For one thing, our authority is limited. The disciple James reminds us: “There is only one who is Lawgiver and Judge”​—Jehovah. So James pointedly asks: “Who are you to be judging your neighbor?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:12-59:4:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">James 4:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:1-45:14:4" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Romans 14:1-4</a>) In addition, our sinful nature can so easily render our judgments unfair. Many attitudes and motives​—including prejudice, injured pride, jealousy, and self-righteousness—​can distort the way we see fellow humans. We have further limitations, and reflecting on these should restrain us from being quick to find fault with others. We cannot read hearts; nor can we know all the personal circumstances of others. Who, then, are we to impute wrong motives to fellow <span id="page163" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="163" data-before-text="163"></span>believers or to criticize their efforts in God’s service?

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> What about our family members? Sadly, in today’s world some of the harshest judgments are handed down in what should be a haven of peace​—the home. It is not uncommon to hear about abusive husbands, wives, or parents who “sentence” their family members to a constant barrage of verbal or physical abuse. But vicious words, bitter sarcasm, and abusive treatment have no place among God’s worshippers.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16, 17. (a) What does Jehovah expect of elders? (b) What has to be done when a sinner fails to manifest genuine repentance, and why?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> All of us have a responsibility to exercise justice, but elders in the Christian congregation especially have a responsibility in this regard. Notice the prophetic description of “princes,” or elders, recorded by Isaiah: “Look! A king will reign for righteousness, and princes will rule for justice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:1-23:32:1" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:1</a>) Yes, Jehovah expects elders to serve in the interests of justice. How can they do this?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> These spiritually qualified men are well aware that justice, or righteousness, requires that the congregation be kept clean. At times, elders are obliged to judge cases of serious wrongdoing. When doing so, they remember that divine justice seeks to extend mercy if at all possible. They thus try to lead the sinner to repentance. But what if the sinner fails to manifest genuine repentance despite such efforts to help him? In perfect justice, Jehovah’s Word directs that a firm step be taken: “Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.” That means expelling him from the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:13" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:9-63:1:11" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 2 John 9-11</a>) It saddens the elders to have to take such action, but they recognize that it is necessary in order to protect the moral and spiritual cleanness of the congregation. Even then, they hope that someday the sinner will come to his senses and return to the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:17-42:15:18" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 15:17, 18</a>.</p>

Of course, elders do not <em>look</em> for flaws in others. Nor do they seize every opportunity to offer correction. But a fellow believer may take “a false step before he is aware of it.” Remembering that divine justice is neither cruel nor unfeeling will move elders to “try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Galatians 6:1</a>) Hence, elders would not scold an erring one or employ harsh words. Instead, counsel that is given lovingly encourages the one receiving it. Even when giving pointed reproof​—straightforwardly outlining the consequences of an unwise course—​elders keep in mind that a fellow believer who has erred is a sheep in Jehovah’s flock.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:7-42:15:7" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 15:7</a>) When counsel or reproof is clearly motivated by and given in love, it is more likely to readjust the erring one.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">19. What decisions are elders called upon to make, and on what must they base such decisions?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Elders are often called upon to make decisions that affect their fellow believers. For example, elders periodically meet to consider whether other brothers in the congregation qualify to be recommended as elders or ministerial servants. The elders know the importance of being impartial. They let God’s requirements for such appointments guide them in making decisions, not relying on mere personal feelings. They thus act “without any prejudice or partiality.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:21-54:5:21" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:21</a>.</p>

So the actions described were currently going on but had to cease.</p></div>
<div id="footnote2" data-fnid="2" class="fn-ref"><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="38-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:2</a>, the Bible says that elders must at times “reprove, reprimand, exhort.” The Greek word rendered “exhort” (<em>pa·ra·ka·leʹo</em>) can mean “to encourage.” A related Greek word, <em>pa·raʹkle·tos,</em> can refer to an advocate in a legal matter. Thus, even when elders give firm reproof, they are to be helpers of those needing spiritual assistance.</p></div>
