<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">1, 2. (a) How does a mother naturally respond to the crying of her baby? (b) What feeling is even stronger than a mother’s compassion?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IN THE middle of the night, a baby cries. Immediately, the mother wakes up. She does not sleep as soundly as she used to​—not since her baby was born. She has learned to distinguish her infant’s different types of crying. Hence, she can often tell whether her newborn needs to be fed, cuddled, or otherwise tended to. But regardless of the reason for the baby’s crying, the mother responds. Her heart cannot let her ignore the needs of her child.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The compassion that a mother feels for the child of her womb is among the most tender feelings known to humans. There is, however, a feeling that is infinitely stronger​—the tender compassion of our God, Jehovah. A consideration of this endearing quality can help us draw closer to Jehovah. Let us, then, discuss what compassion is and how our God manifests it.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 3. What is the meaning of the Hebrew verb rendered “show mercy” or “have pity”?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> In the Bible, there is a close relationship between compassion and mercy. A number of Hebrew and Greek words convey the sense of tender compassion. Consider, for example, the Hebrew verb <em>ra·chamʹ,</em> which is often rendered “show mercy” or “have pity.” One reference work explains that the verb <em>ra·chamʹ</em> “expresses a deep and tender feeling of compassion, such as is aroused by the sight of weakness or suffering in those that are dear to us or need our <span id="page251" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="251" data-before-text="251"></span>help.” This Hebrew term, which Jehovah applies to himself, is related to the word for “womb” and can be described as “motherly compassion.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:19-2:33:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 33:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:33:26-24:33:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 33:26</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">4, 5. How does the Bible use the feelings that a mother has for her baby to teach us about Jehovah’s compassion?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The Bible uses the feelings that a mother has for her baby to teach us about the meaning of Jehovah’s compassion. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:15-23:49:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 49:15</a>, we read: “Can a woman forget her nursing child or have no compassion [<em>ra·chamʹ</em>] for the son of her womb? Even if these women forget, I would never forget you.” That touching description underscores the depth of Jehovah’s compassion for his people. How so?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> It is difficult to imagine that a mother would forget to nourish and care for her nursing child. After all, an infant is helpless; night and day a baby needs its mother’s attention and affection. Sad to say, however, maternal neglect is not unheard of, especially in these “critical times” characterized by a lack of “natural affection.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:3-55:3:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3</a>) Yet, Jehovah declares: “I would never forget you.” The tender compassion that Jehovah has for his servants is unfailing. It is immeasurably stronger than the most tender natural feeling that we can imagine​—the compassion that a mother normally feels for her infant child. Little wonder that one commentator said of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:15-23:49:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 49:15</a>: “This is one of the strongest, if not the strongest expression of God’s love in the Old Testament.”</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. Many imperfect humans have viewed tender compassion in what way, but of what does Jehovah assure us?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Is tender compassion a sign of weakness? Many imperfect humans have held that view. For instance, the Roman <span id="page253" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="253" data-before-text="253"></span>philosopher Seneca, who was a contemporary of Jesus and a leading intellectual figure in Rome, taught that “pity is a weakness of the mind.” Seneca was an advocate of Stoicism, a philosophy stressing calmness that is devoid of feeling. A wise person may help those in distress, said Seneca, but he must not allow himself to feel pity, for such a feeling would deprive him of serenity. That self-centered view of life allowed no room for heartfelt compassion. But that is not at all what Jehovah is like! In his Word, Jehovah assures us that he “is very compassionate and merciful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 5:11</a>, footnote) As we will see, compassion is not a weakness but a strong, vital quality. Let us examine how Jehovah, like a loving parent, manifests it.</p>

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>When Jehovah Showed Compassion to a Nation</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">7, 8. In what way did the Israelites suffer in ancient Egypt, and how did Jehovah respond to their suffering?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The compassion of Jehovah is clearly seen in the way he dealt with the nation of Israel. By the end of the 16th century B.C.E., millions of Israelites were enslaved in ancient Egypt, where they were severely oppressed. The Egyptians “made their life bitter with hard labor, as they worked with clay mortar and bricks and in every form of slavery.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:11-2:1:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 1:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:14-2:1:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14</a>) In their distress, the Israelites cried out to Jehovah for help. How did the God of tender compassion respond?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s heart was touched. He said: “I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry because of those who force them to work; I well know the pains they suffer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:7-2:3:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 3:7</a>) Jehovah could not see the sufferings of his people or hear their outcries without feeling for them. As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102002049/">Chapter 24</a> of this book, Jehovah is a God of empathy. <span id="page254" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="254" data-before-text="254"></span>And empathy​—the ability to identify with the pain of others—​is akin to compassion. But Jehovah did not just <em>feel</em> for his people; he was moved to act in their behalf. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:9-23:63:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 63:9</a> says: “In his love and compassion he repurchased them.” With “a mighty hand,” Jehovah rescued the Israelites out of Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:34-5:4:34" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>) Thereafter, he provided them with miraculous food and delivered them into a fruitful land of their own.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">9, 10. (a) Why did Jehovah repeatedly deliver the Israelites after they were settled in the Promised Land? (b) In the days of Jephthah, Jehovah delivered the Israelites from what oppression, and what moved him to do so?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s compassion did not stop there. When settled in the Promised Land, Israel repeatedly lapsed into unfaithfulness and suffered as a result. But then the people would come to their senses and call out to Jehovah. Again and again he delivered them. Why? “Because he felt compassion for his people.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:15-14:36:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:11-7:2:16" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Judges 2:11-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Consider what happened in the days of Jephthah. Since the Israelites had turned to serving false gods, Jehovah allowed them to be oppressed by the Ammonites for 18 years. Finally, the Israelites repented. The Bible tells us: “They removed the foreign gods from their midst and served Jehovah, so that he could no longer tolerate Israel’s suffering.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:10:6-7:10:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Judges 10:6-16</a>) Once his people manifested genuine repentance, Jehovah could no longer bear to see them suffer. So the God of tender compassion empowered Jephthah to deliver the Israelites out of the hands of their enemies.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:30-7:11:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Judges 11:30-33</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">11. From Jehovah’s dealings with the Israelites, what do we learn about compassion?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span id="page255" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="255" data-before-text="255"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> What do Jehovah’s dealings with the nation of Israel teach us about tender compassion? For one thing, we see that it is more than just a sympathetic awareness of the adversities that people experience. Recall the example of a mother whose compassion moves her to respond to the crying of her baby. Similarly, Jehovah is not deaf to the outcries of his people. His tender compassion moves him to relieve their suffering. In addition, the way Jehovah dealt with the Israelites teaches us that compassion is by no means a weakness, for this tender quality moved him to take strong, decisive action in behalf of his people. But does Jehovah show compassion only to his servants as a group?</p>

<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>Jehovah’s Compassion for Individuals</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12. How did the Law reflect Jehovah’s compassion for individuals?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> The Law that God gave to the nation of Israel showed his compassion for individuals. Take, for example, his concern for the poor. Jehovah knew that unforeseen circumstances might arise that could plunge an Israelite into poverty. How were poor ones to be treated? Jehovah strictly commanded the Israelites: “Do not harden your heart or be tightfisted toward your poor brother. You should generously give to him, and you should not give to him grudgingly, for this is why Jehovah your God will bless your every deed and undertaking.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:15:7-5:15:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 15:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:15:10-5:15:10" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Jehovah further commanded that the Israelites not harvest the edges of their fields completely or pick up any leftovers. Such gleanings were for disadvantaged ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:22-3:23:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:2-8:2:7" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ruth 2:2-7</a>) When the nation observed this considerate legislation in behalf of the poor in their midst, needy individuals in Israel did not have to <span id="page256" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="256" data-before-text="256"></span>beg for food. Was that not a reflection of Jehovah’s tender compassion?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">13, 14. (a) How do David’s words assure us that Jehovah is deeply concerned about us as individuals? (b) How could it be illustrated that Jehovah is close to those who are “brokenhearted” or “crushed in spirit”?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Today, too, our loving God is deeply concerned about us as individuals. We can be sure that he is keenly aware of any suffering we may undergo. The psalmist David wrote: “The eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their cry for help. Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:15-19:34:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 34:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 18</a>) Regarding those described by these words, one Bible commentator notes: “They are of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, that is, humbled for sin, and emptied of self; they are low in their own eyes, and have no confidence in their own merit.” Such ones may feel that Jehovah is far away and that they are too insignificant for him to care about them. But that is not the case. David’s words assure us that Jehovah does not abandon those who are “low in their own eyes.” Our compassionate God knows that at such times, we need him more than ever, and he is near.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Consider an experience. A mother in the United States rushed her two-year-old son to the hospital because he was suffering from a bad case of croup. After examining the boy, the doctors informed the mother that they would have to keep him in the hospital overnight. Where did the mother spend that night? In a chair in the hospital room, right next to her son’s bed! Her little boy was sick, and she just had to be near him. Surely we can expect even more from our loving heavenly Father! After all, we are made in his image. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26</a>) The touching words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a> tell us that when we are “brokenhearted” <span id="page257" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="257" data-before-text="257"></span>or “crushed in spirit,” Jehovah, like a loving parent, “is close”​—ever compassionate and ready to help.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">15. In what ways does Jehovah help us as individuals?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> How, then, does Jehovah help us as individuals? He does not necessarily remove the cause of our suffering. But Jehovah has made abundant provisions for those who cry out to him for help. His Word, the Bible, offers practical counsel that can make a difference. In the congregation, Jehovah provides spiritually qualified overseers, who endeavor to reflect his compassion in helping fellow worshippers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">James 5:14, 15</a>) As the “Hearer of prayer,” he gives “holy spirit to those asking him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Luke 11:13</a>) That spirit can infuse us with “power beyond what is normal” in order to endure until God’s Kingdom removes all stressful problems. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:7-47:4:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>) Are we not grateful for all these provisions? Let us not forget that they are expressions of Jehovah’s tender compassion.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16. What is the greatest example of Jehovah’s compassion, and how does it affect us as individuals?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Of course, the greatest example of Jehovah’s compassion is his giving the One dearest to him as a ransom for us. It was a loving sacrifice on Jehovah’s part, and it opened the way for our salvation. Remember, that ransom provision applies to us personally. With good reason, Zechariah, the father of John the Baptizer, foretold that this provision magnified “the tender compassion of our God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:78-42:1:78" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 1:78</a>.</p>

On the contrary, the Bible clearly <span id="page258" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="258" data-before-text="258"></span>shows that in the case of individuals who set themselves against his righteous ways, Jehovah rightly withholds compassion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:28-58:10:28" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:28</a>) To see why he does so, recall the example of the nation of Israel.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Although Jehovah repeatedly delivered the Israelites from their enemies, his compassion eventually reached its limit.
