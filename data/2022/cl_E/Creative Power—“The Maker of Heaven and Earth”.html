<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">4, 5. How powerful and how large is the sun, yet how does it compare with other stars?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> As you may know, our sun is a star. It appears larger than the stars we see at night because, compared with them, it is quite close. How powerful is it? At its core, the sun is about 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit (15,000,000°C). If you could take a pinhead-sized piece of the sun’s core and put it here on the earth, you could not safely stand within 90 miles (140 km) of that tiny heat source! Every second, the sun emits energy equivalent to the explosion of many hundreds of millions of nuclear bombs.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The sun is so huge that over 1,300,000 of our earths could fit inside it. Is the sun an unusually large star? No, astronomers call it a yellow dwarf. The apostle Paul wrote that “one star differs from another star in glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:41-46:15:41" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians <span id="page49" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="49" data-before-text="49"></span>15:41</a>) He could not have known how true those inspired words are. There is a star so huge that if it were placed right where the sun is, our earth would be <em>inside</em> it. Another giant star so placed would reach all the way out to Saturn​—although that planet is so far from the earth that it took a spacecraft four years to get there, traveling over 40 times faster than a bullet fired from a powerful handgun!</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. How does the Bible show that the number of the stars is vast from a human standpoint?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Even more awesome than the size of the stars is their number.

After all, if a Bible writer, such as Jeremiah, had looked up at the night sky and had tried to count the visible stars, he would have counted only three thousand or so, for that is how many the unaided human eye can detect on a clear night. That number might be comparable to the number of grains in a mere <em>handful</em> of sand.

Astronomers have estimated that there are over 100 billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy alone.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Some say that there are far more. But ours is just one of many galaxies, and many of those swarm with even more stars. How many galaxies are there? The estimates of astronomers have ranged into the hundreds of billions, even trillions. So far, it seems, man cannot even determine the number of galaxies, let alone the exact sum of all the billions of stars they contain. Yet, Jehovah knows that number. Moreover, he gives each star its own <em>name!</em></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8. (a) How would you explain the size of the Milky Way galaxy? (b) By what means does Jehovah order the movements of celestial bodies?</p>

The Milky Way galaxy has been estimated to measure some 100,000 light-years across. Picture a beam of light traveling at the tremendous speed of 186,000 miles each second (300,000 km/​sec). It would take that beam 100,000 years to traverse our galaxy! And some galaxies are many times the size of ours. The Bible says that Jehovah stretches out “the heavens” as if they were mere cloth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:2-19:104:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 104:2</a>) He also orders the movements of these creations. From the smallest speck of interstellar dust to the mightiest galaxy, everything moves according to physical laws that God has formulated and put into effect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:31-18:38:33" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>) Thus, scientists have likened the precise movements of the celestial bodies to the choreography of an elaborate ballet!

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">9, 10. How is Jehovah’s power evident in connection with the positioning of our solar system, Jupiter, the earth, and the moon?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s creative power is evident in our home, the earth. He has placed the earth very carefully in this vast universe. Some scientists believe that many galaxies might prove inhospitable to a life-bearing planet like ours. Much of our Milky Way galaxy was evidently not designed to accommodate life. The galactic center is packed with stars. Radiation is high, and close encounters between stars are common. The fringes of the galaxy lack many of the elements essential to life. Our solar system is ideally situated between such extremes.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span id="page52" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="52" data-before-text="52"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Earth benefits from a distant but giant protector​—the planet Jupiter. More than a thousand times the size of Earth, Jupiter exerts a tremendous gravitational influence. The result? It absorbs or deflects objects that speed through space. Scientists figure that if not for Jupiter, the rain of massive projectiles striking the earth would be 10,000 times more severe than at present. Closer to home, our earth is blessed with an unusual satellite​—the moon. More than an object of beauty and a “night-light,” the moon holds the earth at a constant, steady tilt. That tilt gives the earth its stable, predictable seasons​—another important boon to life here.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">11. How is earth’s atmosphere designed to serve as a protective shield?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s creative power is evident in every facet of the earth’s design. Consider the atmosphere, which serves as a protective shield. The sun emits healthful rays and deadly ones. When the lethal rays strike the earth’s upper atmosphere, they cause ordinary oxygen to turn into ozone. The resulting ozone layer, in turn, absorbs most of those rays. In effect, our planet is designed with its own protective umbrella!</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12. How does the atmospheric water cycle illustrate Jehovah’s creative power?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> That is just one aspect of our atmosphere, a complex mix of gases ideally suited to supporting the creatures living on or near the earth’s surface. Among wonders of the atmosphere is the water cycle. Every year the sun lifts up by evaporation over 100,000 cubic miles (400,000 cu km) of water from the earth’s oceans and seas. The water forms clouds, which are circulated far and wide by atmospheric winds. This water, now filtered and purified, falls as rain, snow, and ice, replenishing water supplies. It is just as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:7-21:1:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a> says: “All the streams flow into the sea, yet <span id="page53" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>the sea is not full. To the place from which the streams flow, there they return so as to flow again.” Only Jehovah could set such a cycle in motion.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">13. What evidence of the Creator’s power do we see in the earth’s vegetation and its soil?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Wherever we see life, we see evidence of the Creator’s power. From the mighty redwoods that tower higher than 30-story buildings to the microscopic plant life that teems in the oceans and provides much of the oxygen we breathe, Jehovah’s creative power is evident. The very soil is packed with living things​—worms, fungi, and microbes, all working together in complex ways that help plants to grow. Fittingly, the Bible speaks of the ground, or soil, as having power.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:12-1:4:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 4:12</a>, footnote.</p>

For instance, a million atoms laid side by side would not span the thickness of a human hair. And even if an atom were expanded until it was as tall as a 14-story building, its nucleus would be the size of a mere grain of salt located on the seventh floor.

Jehovah told Job of the ostrich, which “laughs at the horse and at its rider.” Indeed, this eight-foot-tall (2.5 m) bird may be flightless, but it can run 40 miles per hour (65 km/​hr), covering up to 15 feet (4.5 m) in a single stride! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:39:13-18:39:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 39:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:39:18-18:39:18" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 18</a>) On the other hand, the albatross spends most of its life in the air over the seas. A natural glider, this bird has a wingspan of some 11 feet (3 m). It may soar for hours at a stretch without flapping its wings. By way of contrast, at only two inches (5 cm) in length, the bee hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world. It may flap its wings up to 80 times in a second! Hummingbirds, glittering like little winged gems, can hover like helicopters and even fly backward.</p>

It may weigh as much as a herd of 30 adult elephants. Its tongue alone weighs as much as one elephant. Its heart is the size of a small car. This huge organ beats only 9 times per minute​—in contrast with the hummingbird’s heart, which may beat some 1,200 times per minute.

Biologists have identified well over a million species of living things on earth; yet, opinions vary as to how many millions more there may be. A human artist may find that his creativity runs dry at times. In contrast, Jehovah’s creativity​—his power to invent and create new and diverse things—​is obviously inexhaustible.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Has Jehovah stopped exercising his creative power?

His work of bringing his purposes to fulfillment, however, has continued uninterrupted. Such work has included the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures. His work has even involved the bringing forth of “a new creation,” which will be discussed in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102002043/">Chapter 19</a>.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:17-47:5:17" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>.</p>
