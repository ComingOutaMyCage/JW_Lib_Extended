<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE Israelites were in danger as they entered the region of Sinai early in 1513 B.C.E. A fear-inspiring trek lay before them, a journey through a “vast and terrible wilderness infested with poisonous snakes and scorpions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:15-5:8:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>, <em>The New English Bible</em>) They also faced the threat of attack by hostile nations. Jehovah had brought his people into this situation. As their God, would he be able to protect them?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s words were most reassuring: “You have seen for yourselves what I did to the Egyptians, in order to carry you on wings of eagles and bring you to myself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:4-2:19:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 19:4</a>) Jehovah reminded his people that he had delivered them from the Egyptians, using eagles, as it were, to carry them to safety. But there are other reasons why “wings of eagles” fittingly illustrate divine protection.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 3. Why do “wings of eagles” fittingly illustrate divine protection?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The eagle uses its broad, strong wings for more than just soaring aloft. In the heat of the day, a mother eagle will arch her wings​—which may span over seven feet (2 m)—​to form a protective umbrella, shielding her tender nestlings from the scorching sun. At other times, she wraps her wings around her offspring to protect them from the cold wind. Just as the eagle safeguards its young, so Jehovah had shielded and protected the fledgling nation of Israel. Now in the wilderness, his people would continue to find refuge in the shadow of his mighty wings as long <span id="page68" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="68" data-before-text="68"></span>as they remained faithful.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">4, 5. Why can we have absolute confidence in God’s promise of protection?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Jehovah is certainly capable of protecting his servants. He is “God Almighty”​—a title indicating that he possesses irresistible power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:1-1:17:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 17:1</a>) Like an unstoppable tide, Jehovah’s applied power cannot be thwarted. Since he is able to do anything his will directs, we may ask, ‘Is it Jehovah’s will to use his power to protect his people?’</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The answer, in a word, is yes! Jehovah assures us that he will protect his people. “God is our refuge and strength, a help that is readily found in times of distress,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:1-19:46:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1</a>. Since God “cannot lie,” we can have absolute confidence in his promise of protection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:2-56:1:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Titus 1:2</a>) Let us consider some of the vivid word pictures that Jehovah uses to describe his protective care.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">6, 7. (a) The shepherd of Bible times provided what protection for his sheep? (b) How does the Bible illustrate Jehovah’s heartfelt desire to protect and care for his sheep?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jehovah is our Shepherd, and “we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:1-19:23:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 23:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:3-19:100:3" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 100:3</a>) Few animals are as helpless as domestic sheep. The shepherd of Bible times had to be courageous to protect his sheep from lions, wolves, and bears, as well as from thieves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:34-9:17:35" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:12-43:10:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 10:12, 13</a>) But there were times when protecting the sheep called for tenderness. When a sheep gave birth far from the fold, the caring shepherd would guard the mother during her helpless moments and then pick up the defenseless lamb and carry it to the fold.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:11-26:34:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>) Recall the description of Jehovah found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:11-23:40:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:11</a>, discussed in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102002023/">Chapter 2</a> of this book: “Like a shepherd he will care for his flock. With his arm he will gather together the lambs, and in his bosom he will carry them.” How does the little lamb come to be in the shepherd’s “bosom”​—the folds of his upper garment? The lamb might approach the shepherd, even nudge his leg. However, it is the shepherd who must bend over, pick up the lamb, and gently place it in the security of his bosom. What a tender picture of the willingness of our Great Shepherd to shield and protect us!</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> God’s promise of protection is conditional​—it is realized only by those who draw close to him. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:10-20:18:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a> states: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous one runs and receives protection.” In Bible times, towers were sometimes built in the wilderness as safe places of refuge. But it was up to the one in danger to flee to such a tower to find safety. It is similar with finding refuge in God’s name. This involves more than just repeating God’s name; the divine name itself is no magic charm. Rather, we need to know and trust the Bearer of that name and live in harmony with his righteous standards. How kind of Jehovah to reassure us that if we turn to him in faith, he will be a tower of protection for us!</p>

During Israel’s history, Jehovah’s mighty “hand” often kept powerful enemies at bay.

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10, 11. What Bible examples show how Jehovah used his protective power in behalf of individuals?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> When three young Hebrews​—known as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—​refused to bow down to King Nebuchadnezzar’s image of gold, the furious king threatened to throw them into a superheated furnace. “Who is the god who can rescue you out of my hands?” taunted Nebuchadnezzar, the most powerful monarch on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:15-27:3:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 3:15</a>) The three young men had complete confidence in the power of their God to protect them, but they did not presume that he would do so. Hence, they answered: “If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:17-27:3:17" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Daniel 3:17</a>) Indeed, that fiery furnace, even when heated seven times hotter than normal, presented no challenge to their all-powerful God. He did protect them, and the king was forced to acknowledge: “There is no other god who is able to rescue like this one.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:29-27:3:29" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 3:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Jehovah also provided a truly remarkable demonstration of his protective power when he transferred the life of his only-begotten Son to the womb of the Jewish virgin Mary. An angel told Mary that she would “become pregnant and give birth to a son.” The angel explained: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:31-42:1:31" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 1:31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 35</a>) Seemingly, God’s Son had never been so vulnerable. Would the sin and imperfection of the human mother blemish the embryo? Would Satan be able to injure or kill that Son before he was born? Impossible! Jehovah formed, in effect, a protective wall around Mary so that nothing​—no <span id="page72" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>imperfection, no hurtful force, no murderous human, nor any demon—​could damage the growing embryo, from the moment of conception on. Jehovah continued to protect Jesus during his youth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:1-40:2:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 2:1-15</a>) Until God’s appointed time, his dear Son was unassailable.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Why did Jehovah protect certain individuals in such miraculous ways? In many cases Jehovah protected individuals in order to protect something far more important: the outworking of his purpose. For example, the survival of the infant Jesus was essential to the fulfillment of God’s purpose, which will ultimately benefit all mankind. The record of the many displays of protective power is part of the inspired Scriptures, which “were written for our instruction, so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) Yes, these examples strengthen our faith in our all-powerful God.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> The promise of divine protection does not mean that Jehovah is obligated to work miracles in our behalf. No, our God does not guarantee us a problem-free life in this old system. Many faithful servants of Jehovah face severe adversities, including poverty, war, sickness, and death. Jesus plainly told his disciples that as individuals they might be put to death because of their faith. That is why Jesus stressed the need for endurance to the end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 24:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:13-40:24:13" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 13</a>) If Jehovah were to use his power to effect miraculous deliverance in all cases, Satan would no doubt <span id="page73" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="73" data-before-text="73"></span>taunt Jehovah and call into question the genuineness of our devotion to our God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:9-18:1:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 1:9, 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Even in Bible times, Jehovah did not use his protective power to shield each of his servants from untimely death.

Without question, living in harmony with God’s Word can improve our health and extend our life.
