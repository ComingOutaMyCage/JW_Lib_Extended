Prologue




Dear Reader:
Do you feel close to God? To many, that seems just impossible. Some fear that he is too remote; others feel hopelessly unworthy. However, the Bible lovingly urges us: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.” (James 4:8) He even assures his worshippers: “I, Jehovah your God, am grasping your right hand, the One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid. I will help you.’”​—Isaiah 41:13.
How can we reach out for such a close relationship with God? In any friendship we forge, the bond is based on knowing the person, admiring and valuing his distinctive traits. So God’s qualities and ways, as revealed in the Bible, are a vital field of study. Pondering the way Jehovah manifests each of his qualities, seeing how Jesus Christ perfectly reflected them, and understanding how we too may cultivate them will draw us closer to God. We will see that Jehovah is the rightful and ideal Sovereign of the universe. What is more, he is the Father we all need. Strong, just, wise, and loving, he never abandons his faithful children.
May this book help you draw ever closer to Jehovah God, to forge a bond with him that will never be broken, so that you may live to praise him forever.
