<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE disciples were terrified. They were sailing across the Sea of Galilee when a storm suddenly descended upon them. No doubt they had seen storms on this lake before​—after all, some of the men were experienced fishermen.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:18-40:4:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 4:18, 19</a>) But this was “a great violent windstorm,” and it quickly churned the sea into a wet fury. The men worked frantically to steer the vessel, but the storm was overpowering. Surging waves “kept crashing into the boat,” which began filling with water. Despite the commotion, Jesus was fast asleep in the stern, exhausted after a day of teaching the crowds. Fearing for their lives, the disciples woke him up, pleading: “Lord, save us, we are about to perish!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:35-41:4:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 4:35-38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:23-40:8:25" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matthew 8:23-25</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jesus was not afraid. With complete confidence, he rebuked the wind and the sea: “Hush! Be quiet!” Immediately, the wind and the sea obeyed​—the tempest ceased, the waves disappeared into stillness, and “a great calm set in.” An unusual fear now gripped the disciples. “Who really is this?” they murmured to one another. Indeed, what kind of man could rebuke the wind and the sea as if correcting an unruly child?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:39-41:4:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 4:39-41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:26-40:8:27" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 8:26, 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> But Jesus was no ordinary man. Jehovah’s power was <span id="page88" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="88" data-before-text="88"></span>displayed toward him and through him in extraordinary ways.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Consider the power that Jesus had during his prehuman existence. Jehovah exercised his own “eternal power” when he created his only-begotten Son, who came to be known as Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:15</a>) Thereafter, Jehovah delegated tremendous power and authority to this Son, assigning him to carry out His creative purposes. Concerning the Son, the Bible says: “All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 1:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> We can but barely perceive the magnitude of that assignment. Imagine the power needed to bring into existence millions of mighty angels, the physical universe with its billions of galaxies, and the earth with its abundant variety of life. To accomplish those tasks, the only-begotten Son had at his disposal the most powerful force in the universe​—God’s holy spirit. This Son found great pleasure in being the Master Worker, whom Jehovah used in creating all other things.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:22-20:8:31" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>.</p>

As “King of kings and Lord of lords,” he has been authorized to bring to “nothing all government and all authority and power”​—visible and invisible—​that stand in opposition to his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:16-66:19:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 19:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:24-46:15:26" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:24-26</a>) God has “left nothing that is not subject to” Jesus​—that is, with the exception of Jehovah himself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:8-58:2:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:27-46:15:27" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:27</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:1-43:13:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 13:1</a>) Jesus has established a flawless record in this regard.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8. Following his anointing, what was Jesus empowered to do, and how did he use his power?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Evidently, Jesus performed no miracles when he was a boy growing up in Nazareth. But that changed after he was baptized in 29 C.E., at about 30 years of age. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:21-42:3:23" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 3:21-23</a>) The Bible tells us: “God anointed him with holy spirit and power, and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:38-44:10:38" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 10:38</a>) “Doing good”​—does that not indicate that Jesus used his power aright?

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">9-11. (a) Where did Jesus do much of his teaching, and what challenge did he face? (b) Why were the crowds astounded at Jesus’ way of teaching?</p>

He often taught in the open air​—on lakeshores and hillsides as well as on the streets and in marketplaces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:53-41:6:56" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Mark 6:53-56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:1-42:5:3" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Luke 5:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:26-42:13:26" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 13:26</a>) His listeners could simply walk away if his words did not hold their interest. In the era before printed books, appreciative listeners had to carry his words in their mind and heart. So Jesus’ teaching needed to be thoroughly arresting, plainly understood, and easily remembered. But this challenge posed no problem for Jesus. Consider, for example, his Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> One morning early in 31 C.E., a crowd gathered on a hillside near the Sea of Galilee. Some had come from Judea and Jerusalem, 60 to 70 miles (100 to 110 km) away. Others had come from the seacoast area of Tyre and Sidon, to the north. Many sick people drew close to Jesus to touch him, and he healed them all. When there was not even one seriously ill person left among them, he began to teach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:17-42:6:19" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 6:17-19</a>) When he finished speaking some time later, they were amazed by what they had heard. Why?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Years later, one who had heard that sermon wrote: “The crowds were astounded at his way of teaching, for he was teaching them as a person having authority.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:28-40:7:29" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>) Jesus spoke with a power they could feel. He spoke for God and backed up his teaching with the authority of God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:16-43:7:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 7:16</a>) Jesus’ statements were clear, his exhortations persuasive, and his arguments irrefutable. His words got to the heart of issues as well as to the hearts of his listeners. He taught them how to find happiness, how to pray, how to seek God’s Kingdom, and how to build for a secure future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:7:27" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3–7:27</a>) His words <span id="page92" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="92" data-before-text="92"></span>awakened the hearts of those hungering for truth and righteousness.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> The powerful works that Jesus performed on earth were just foregleams of even grander blessings to come under his kingly rule. In God’s new world, Jesus will once again work miracles​—but on a global scale! Consider some of the thrilling prospects ahead.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong></span> Jesus will restore the earth’s ecology to perfect balance. Recall that he demonstrated control of natural forces by calming a windstorm. Surely, then, under Christ’s Kingdom rule, mankind will have no need to fear being harmed by typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or other natural disasters. Since Jesus is the Master Worker, whom Jehovah used to create the earth and all life on it, he fully understands the makeup of the earth. He knows how to use its resources properly. Under his rule, this entire earth will be turned into Paradise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">23. As King, how will Jesus satisfy mankind’s needs?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong></span> What about mankind’s needs? Jesus’ ability to feed thousands bountifully, using only a few meager provisions, assures us that his rule will bring freedom from <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>hunger. Indeed, an abundance of food, distributed fairly, will end hunger forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Psalm 72:16</a>) His mastery over sickness and disease tells us that sick, blind, deaf, maimed, and lame people will be healed​—completely and permanently. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 35:5, 6</a>) His ability to resurrect the dead ensures that his mightiness as a heavenly King includes the power to resurrect the countless millions whom his Father is pleased to remember.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="50-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">24. As we reflect on the power of Jesus, what should we keep in mind, and why?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong></span> As we reflect on the power of Jesus, let us keep in mind that this Son perfectly imitates his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="51-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) Jesus’ use of power thus gives us a clear picture of how Jehovah uses power. For example, think about the tender way that Jesus healed a certain leper. Moved with pity, Jesus touched the man and said: “I want to!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:40-41:1:42" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Mark 1:40-42</a>) By means of accounts such as this, Jehovah is, in effect, saying, ‘That is how I use my power!’ Are you not moved to praise our almighty God and give thanks that he uses his power in such a loving way?</p>

Because of the sea’s low elevation (some 700 feet (200 m) below sea level), the air is much warmer there than in the surrounding area, and this creates atmospheric disturbances. Strong winds rush down the Jordan Valley from Mount Hermon, situated to the north. The calm of one moment may well yield to the raging storm of the next.</p></div>
<div id="footnote2" data-fnid="2" class="fn-ref"><p id="p34" data-pid="34"><a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> In addition, the Gospels at times group many miracles under a single, general description. For example, on one occasion a “whole city” came to see him, and he cured “many” sick ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:32-41:1:34" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Mark 1:32-34</a>.</p></div>
<div id="footnote3" data-fnid="3" class="fn-ref"><p id="p35" data-pid="35"><a href="#footnotesource3" class="fn-symbol">c</a> Spitting was a means or sign of healing accepted by both Jews and Gentiles, and the use of saliva in cures is reported in rabbinic writings. Jesus may have spit simply to convey to the man that he was about to be healed. Whatever the case, Jesus was not using his saliva as a natural healing agent.</p></div>
