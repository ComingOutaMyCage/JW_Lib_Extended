<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">1, 2. (a) What might sound farfetched to many, but of what does the Bible assure us? (b) Abraham was granted what close relationship, and why?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>HOW would you feel if the Creator of heaven and earth said of you, “This is my friend”? To many, that might sound farfetched. After all, how could a mere human ever enter into a friendship with Jehovah God? Yet, the Bible assures us that we really can be close to God.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Abraham of old was one who enjoyed such closeness. Jehovah identified that patriarch as “my friend.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:8-23:41:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:8</a>) Yes, Jehovah considered Abraham to be a personal friend. Abraham was granted that close relationship because he “put faith in Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 2:23</a>) Today, too, Jehovah looks for opportunities to form a close friendship with those who serve him and to “express his love” to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:15-5:10:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>) His Word urges: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) In these words we find both an invitation and a promise.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3. What invitation does Jehovah extend to us, and what promise is connected with it?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Jehovah invites us to draw near to him. He is ready and willing to receive us into his favor as friends. At the same time, he promises that if we take steps to draw close to him, he will take corresponding action. He will draw close to us. Thus we may enter into something truly precious​—“close friendship with Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:14-19:25:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 25:14</a>) “Close friendship” here conveys the idea of confidential talk with a special friend.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. How would you describe a close friend, and in what way does Jehovah prove to be such a friend to those who draw close to him?</p>

You trust him, for he has proved to be loyal. Your joys are heightened when you share them with him. His sympathetic ear lightens the burden of your sorrows. Even when no one else seems to understand you, he does. Similarly, when you draw close to God, you come to have a special Friend who truly values you, deeply cares about you, and fully understands you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:14-19:103:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 103:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:7</a>) You trust him with your inmost feelings, for you know that he is loyal to those who are loyal to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:25-19:18:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 18:25</a>) However, this privileged friendship with God is within our reach only because he has made it possible.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 5:8</a>) Yes, Jehovah arranged for Jesus “to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) Our faith in that ransom sacrifice makes it possible for us to be close to God. Since God “first loved us,” he laid the foundation for us to enter into friendship with him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:19-62:4:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 4:19</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:19-23:45:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:19</a>) Furthermore, what he reveals about himself is available to all, even to those of us who may be considered lowly by the world’s standards.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:25-40:11:25" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 11:25</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> The Bible itself is evidence of Jehovah’s love for us. In his Word, he reveals himself in terms we can comprehend​—proof not only that he loves us but that he wants us to know and love him. What we read in this precious book enables us to draw close to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3</a>) Let us discuss some of the heartwarming ways in which Jehovah reveals himself in his Word.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 9. What are some examples of direct statements in the Bible that identify God’s qualities?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> The Scriptures contain many direct statements identifying God’s qualities. Note some examples. “Jehovah loves justice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 37:28</a>) God is “great in power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:23-18:37:23" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 37:23</a>) “‘I am loyal,’ declares Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:12-24:3:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jeremiah 3:12</a>) “He is wise in heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:4-18:9:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 9:4</a>) He is “a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6</a>) “You, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>) And, as mentioned in the preceding chapter, one quality is predominant: “God is love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) As you reflect on these pleasing attributes, are you not drawn to this incomparable God?</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10, 11. (a) To help us see his personality more clearly, what has Jehovah included in his Word? (b) What Bible example helps us visualize God’s power in action?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> In addition to telling us what his qualities are, Jehovah <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>has lovingly included in his Word concrete examples of these qualities in action. Such accounts paint vivid mental pictures that help us see the various facets of his personality more clearly. That, in turn, helps us draw close to him. Consider an example.</p>
<div class="blockTxt"><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sc">The Bible helps us draw close to Jehovah</p>
</div>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> It is one thing to read that God has “awe-inspiring power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26</a>) It is quite another to read about how he delivered Israel through the Red Sea and then sustained the nation in the wilderness for 40 years. You can visualize the surging waters splitting apart. You can picture the nation​—perhaps 3,000,000 in all—​walking over the dry seabed, the congealed waters standing like massive walls on either side. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:21-2:14:21" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Exodus 14:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:8-2:15:8" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 15:8</a>) You can see the evidence of God’s protective care in the wilderness. Water flowed out of rock. Food, resembling white seeds, appeared on the ground. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:31-2:16:31" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Exodus 16:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:11-4:20:11" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Numbers 20:11</a>) Jehovah here reveals not only that he has power but that he uses it in behalf of his people. Is it not reassuring to know that our prayers go up to a powerful God who “is our refuge and strength, a help that is readily found in times of distress”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:1-19:46:1" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12. How does Jehovah help us to “see” him in terms we can understand?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Jehovah, who is a Spirit, has done even more to help us know him. As humans we are bound by visible realities and therefore cannot see into the spirit realm. For <span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>God to describe himself to us in spirit terms would be like trying to explain details of your appearance, such as your eye color or freckles, to someone born blind. Rather, Jehovah kindly helps us to “see” him in terms we can understand. At times, he employs metaphors and similes, likening himself to things that are known to us. He even describes himself as having certain human features.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Notice the description of Jehovah found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:11-23:40:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:11</a>: “Like a shepherd he will care for his flock. With his arm he will gather together the lambs, and in his bosom he will carry them.” Jehovah is here compared to a shepherd who picks up lambs with “his arm.” This denotes God’s ability to protect and support his people, even the more vulnerable ones. We can feel safe in his strong arms, for if we are loyal to him, he will never forsake us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Romans 8:38, 39</a>) The Great Shepherd carries the lambs “in his bosom”​—an expression referring to the loose folds of the upper garment, in which a shepherd would at times carry a newborn lamb. We are thus assured that Jehovah cherishes and tenderly cares for us. It is only natural to want to be close to him.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">14. Why can it be said that Jehovah provides the clearest revelation of himself through Jesus?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> In his Word, Jehovah provides the clearest revelation of himself through his beloved Son, Jesus. No one could <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>reflect God’s thinking and feelings more closely or explain Him more vividly than Jesus did. After all, that firstborn Son existed alongside his Father before other spirit creatures and the physical universe were created. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15</a>) Jesus was thoroughly acquainted with Jehovah. That is why he could say: “No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:22-42:10:22" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 10:22</a>) When on earth as a man, Jesus revealed his Father in two important ways.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">15, 16. In what two ways did Jesus reveal his Father?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> First, Jesus’ <em>teachings</em> help us to know his Father. Jesus described Jehovah in terms that touch our heart. For example, to explain the merciful God who welcomes back repentant sinners, Jesus likened Jehovah to a forgiving father who is so deeply moved at the sight of his returning prodigal son that he runs and embraces his son and tenderly kisses him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:11-42:15:24" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Luke 15:11-24</a>) Jesus also portrayed <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>Jehovah as a God who “draws” righthearted people because he loves them as individuals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) He even knows when a tiny sparrow falls to the earth. “Have no fear,” Jesus explained, “you are worth more than many sparrows.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:29-40:10:29" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 10:29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:31-40:10:31" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 31</a>) We cannot help but feel drawn to such a caring God.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Second, Jesus’ <em>example</em> shows us what Jehovah is like. Jesus so perfectly reflected his Father that he could say: “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) Thus, when we read in the Gospels about Jesus​—the feelings he displayed and the way he dealt with others—​we are in a sense seeing a living portrait of his Father. Jehovah could hardly have given us a clearer revelation of his qualities than that. Why?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">17. Illustrate what Jehovah has done to help us grasp what he is like.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> To illustrate: Imagine trying to explain what kindness is. You might define it with words. But if you can point to someone actually performing a kind deed and say, “That is an example of kindness,” the word “kindness” takes on added meaning and becomes easier to understand. Jehovah has done something similar to help us grasp what he is like. As well as describing himself in words, he has provided us with the living example of his Son. In Jesus, the qualities of God are seen in action. Through the Gospel accounts describing Jesus, Jehovah is, in effect, saying: “That is what I am like.” How does the inspired record describe Jesus when on earth?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">18. How did Jesus express the attributes of power, justice, and wisdom?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> The four main attributes of God found beautiful expression in Jesus. He had <em>power</em> over disease, hunger, even death. Yet, unlike selfish men who abuse their <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>power, he never used miraculous power in his own behalf or to hurt others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:2-40:4:4" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matthew 4:2-4</a>) He loved <em>justice.</em> His heart was filled with righteous indignation at seeing unfair merchants exploiting the people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:12-40:21:13" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matthew 21:12, 13</a>) He treated the poor and downtrodden with impartiality, helping such ones to “find refreshment” for themselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:4-40:11:5" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matthew 11:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 28-30</a>) There was matchless <em>wisdom</em> in the teachings of Jesus, who was “more than Solomon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:42-40:12:42" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Matthew 12:42</a>) But Jesus never made a showy display of his wisdom. His words reached the hearts of common people, for his teachings were clear, simple, and practical.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">19, 20. (a) How was Jesus an outstanding example of love? (b) As we read and reflect on the example of Jesus, what should we keep in mind?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Jesus was an outstanding example of <em>love.</em> Throughout his ministry, he displayed love in its many facets, including empathy and compassion. He could not see the suffering of others without feeling pity. Over and over again, that sympathetic regard moved him to action. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:14-40:14:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 14:14</a>) Although he healed the sick and fed the hungry, Jesus expressed compassion in a far more vital way. He helped others to know, accept, and love the truth about God’s Kingdom, which will bring permanent blessings to mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Mark 6:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Luke 4:43</a>) Above all, Jesus showed self-sacrificing love by willingly surrendering his life in behalf of others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:13-43:15:13" data-bid="41-1" class="b">John 15:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Is it any wonder that people of all ages and backgrounds felt drawn to this man of tender warmth and deep feelings?

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong></span> Starting with this chapter, there is a special feature entitled <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>“Questions for Meditation.” For example, look at the <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102002023/54-58">box on page 24</a>. The scriptures and questions are not designed as a review of the chapter. Rather, their purpose is to help you reflect on other important aspects of the subject. How can you make effective use of this feature? Look up each of the cited texts, and read the verses carefully. Then consider the question accompanying each citation. Ponder over the answers. You might do some research. Ask yourself some additional questions: ‘What does this information tell me about Jehovah? How does it affect my life? How can I use it to help others?’</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong></span> Such meditation can help us draw ever closer to Jehovah. Why? The Bible associates meditation with the heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:14-19:19:14" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 19:14</a>) When we reflect appreciatively on what we learn about God, the information filters into our figurative heart, where it affects our thinking, stirs our feelings, and ultimately moves us to action. Our love for God deepens, and that love, in turn, moves us to want to please him as our dearest Friend. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>) To come into such a relationship, we must get to know Jehovah’s qualities and ways. First, though, let us discuss an aspect of God’s nature that provides a compelling reason for drawing close to him​—his holiness.</p>
