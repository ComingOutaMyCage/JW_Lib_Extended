<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IT WAS a gross injustice. The handsome young man had committed no crime, yet he found himself confined in a dungeon, falsely accused of attempted rape. But this was not his first encounter with injustice. Years earlier, at the age of 17, this young man, Joseph, had been betrayed by his own brothers, who had nearly murdered him. He had then been sold into slavery in a foreign land. There he had refused the advances of his master’s wife. The spurned woman framed the false accusation, and that was how he came to be in custody. Sadly, there seemed to be no one to intercede for Joseph.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> However, the God who “loves righteousness and justice” was watching. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:5-19:33:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 33:5</a>) Jehovah acted to correct the injustices, maneuvering events so that Joseph was finally released. More than that, Joseph​—the man who had been cast into prison—​was eventually placed in a position of great responsibility and extraordinary honor.

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>What Is Justice?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. From a human standpoint, how is justice often understood?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> From a human standpoint, justice is often understood to be nothing more than the fair application of the rules of law. The book <em>Right and Reason​—Ethics in Theory and Practice</em> says that “justice is connected with law, obligation, rights, and duties, and measures out its awards according to equality or merit.” Jehovah’s justice, however, involves more than the cold application of regulations out of a sense of duty or obligation.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">5, 6. (a) What is the meaning of the original-language words rendered “justice”? (b) What does it mean that God is just?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The breadth and depth of Jehovah’s justice can better be understood by considering the original-language words used in the Bible. In the Hebrew Scriptures, three principal words are involved. The word most often rendered “justice” may also be rendered “what is right.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:25-1:18:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 18:25</a>) The other two words are usually rendered “righteousness.” In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the word translated “righteousness” is defined as the “quality of being right or just.” Basically, then, righteousness and justice are closely related.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:24-30:5:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Amos 5:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Hence, when the Bible says that God is just, it is telling us that he does what is right and fair and that he does so consistently, without partiality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:11-45:2:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 2:11</a>) Really, it is inconceivable that he would act otherwise. Faithful Elihu stated: “It is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly, for the Almighty to do wrong!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:10-18:34:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 34:10</a>) Indeed, it is impossible for Jehovah to act unjustly. Why? For two important reasons.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">7, 8. (a) Why is Jehovah incapable of acting unjustly? (b) What moves Jehovah to be righteous, or just, in his dealings?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span id="page110" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> First, he is holy. As we noted in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102002024/">Chapter 3</a>, Jehovah is infinitely pure and upright. Therefore, he is incapable of acting unrighteously, or unjustly. Consider what that means. The holiness of our heavenly Father gives us every reason to trust that he will never mistreat his children. Jesus had such confidence. On the final night of his earthly life, he prayed: “Holy Father, watch over them [the disciples] on account of your own name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:11-43:17:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 17:11</a>) “Holy Father”​—in the Scriptures, that form of address applies to Jehovah alone. This is fitting, for no human father can compare with Him in holiness. Jesus had complete faith that his disciples would be safe in the hands of the Father, who is absolutely pure and clean and entirely separated from all sinfulness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:9-40:23:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 23:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Second, unselfish love is intrinsic to God’s very nature. Such love moves him to be righteous, or just, in his dealings with others. But injustice in its many forms​—including racism, discrimination, and partiality—​often springs from greed and selfishness, the opposites of love. Regarding the God of love, the Bible assures us: “Jehovah is righteous; he loves righteous acts.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:7-19:11:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 11:7</a>) Jehovah says of himself: “I, Jehovah, love justice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:8-23:61:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 61:8</a>) Is it not comforting to know that our God takes delight in doing what is right, or just?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:9:24-24:9:24" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jeremiah 9:24</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s justice, like every other facet of his matchless personality, is perfect, not lacking in anything. Extolling <span id="page112" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span>Jehovah, Moses wrote: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness who is never unjust; righteous and upright is he.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:3-5:32:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:3, 4</a>) Every expression of Jehovah’s justice is flawless​—never too lenient, never too harsh.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> There is a close connection between Jehovah’s justice and his mercy. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:116:5-19:116:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 116:5</a> says: “Jehovah is compassionate and righteous [“just,” <em>The New American Bible</em>]; our God is merciful.” Yes, Jehovah is both just and merciful. The two traits are not at odds. His exercising of mercy is not a watering down of his justice, as if his justice would otherwise be too severe. Rather, the two qualities are often expressed by him at the same time, even in the same act. Consider an example.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> All humans are by inheritance sinful and thus deserving of sin’s penalty​—death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) But Jehovah finds no pleasure in the death of sinners. He is “a God ready to forgive, compassionate and merciful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:17-16:9:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9:17</a>) Still, because he is holy, he cannot condone unrighteousness. How, then, could he show mercy to inherently sinful humans? The answer is found in one of the most precious truths of God’s Word: Jehovah’s provision of a ransom for mankind’s salvation. In <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102002037/">Chapter 14</a> we will learn more about this loving arrangement. It is at once profoundly just and supremely merciful. By means of it, Jehovah can express tender mercy toward repentant sinners while maintaining his standards of perfect justice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:21-45:3:26" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 3:21-26</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s justice is, not a cold quality that repels us, <span id="page113" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="113" data-before-text="113"></span>but an endearing quality that draws us to him. The Bible clearly describes the compassionate nature of Jehovah’s justice, or righteousness. Let us consider some of the heartwarming ways that Jehovah exercises his justice.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s perfect justice moves him to show faithfulness and loyalty toward his servants. The psalmist David came to appreciate firsthand this facet of Jehovah’s justice. From his own experience and from his study of God’s ways, what conclusion did David reach? He declared: “Jehovah loves justice, and he will not abandon his loyal ones. They will always be guarded.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 37:28</a>) What comforting assurance! Our God will never for one moment abandon those who are loyal to him. We can therefore count on his closeness and his loving care. His justice guarantees this!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:7-20:2:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:7, 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Divine justice is sensitive to the needs of the afflicted. Jehovah’s concern for disadvantaged ones is evident in the Law he gave to Israel. For example, the Law made special provisions to ensure that orphans and widows were cared for. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:17-5:24:21" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 24:17-21</a>) Recognizing how difficult life could be for such families, Jehovah himself became their fatherly Judge and Protector, the one who “executes justice for the fatherless child and the widow.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:18-5:10:18" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:5-19:68:5" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Psalm 68:5</a>) Jehovah warned the Israelites that if they victimized defenseless women and children, he would unfailingly hear the outcry of such <span id="page114" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="114" data-before-text="114"></span>ones. He stated: “My anger will blaze.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:22-2:22:24" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Exodus 22:22-24</a>) While anger is not one of Jehovah’s dominant qualities, he is provoked to righteous indignation by deliberate acts of injustice, especially when the victims are the lowly and the helpless.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:6-19:103:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 103:6</a>.</p>

He is completely free from bias or favoritism. Consider a truly remarkable evidence of Jehovah’s impartiality. The opportunity of becoming his true worshippers, with endless life in view, is not restricted to an elite few. Rather, “in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>) This marvelous prospect is open to all regardless of their social standing, the color of their skin, or the country in which they live.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Take, for example, God’s dealings with ancient Israel.

In addition, we learn that his justice is never hasty. Because of Jehovah’s patience, many people wrongly conclude that he will never execute judgment against the wicked. But that is far from the truth, for God’s dealings with Israel also teach us that divine patience has limits. Jehovah is firm for righteousness.
