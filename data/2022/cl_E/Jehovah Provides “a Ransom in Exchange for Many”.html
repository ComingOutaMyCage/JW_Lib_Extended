<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The ransom became necessary because of the sin of Adam. By disobeying God, Adam bequeathed to his offspring a legacy of sickness, sorrow, pain, and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:17-1:2:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:20-45:8:20" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Romans 8:20</a>) God could not yield to sentiment and simply commute the death sentence.

Satan cast a dark shadow across God’s good name. In effect, he accused Jehovah of being a liar and a cruel dictator who deprived his creatures of freedom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-5</a>) By seemingly thwarting God’s purpose to fill the earth with righteous humans, Satan also labeled God a failure.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. What are some of the expressions used in the Bible to describe God’s means of saving mankind?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s solution was both supremely merciful and profoundly just​—one that no human could ever have devised. Yet, it was elegantly simple. It is variously referred to as a purchase, a reconciliation, a redemption, a propitiation, and an atonement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:49:8-19:49:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 49:8</a>, footnote; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:13-48:3:13" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Galatians 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:20-51:1:20" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Colossians 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:17-58:2:17" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Hebrews 2:17</a>) But the expression that perhaps best describes matters is the one used by Jesus himself. He said: “The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom [Greek, <em>lyʹtron</em>] in exchange for many.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">7, 8. (a) What does the term “ransom” mean in the Scriptures? (b) In what way does a ransom involve equivalency?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span id="page141" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="141" data-before-text="141"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> What is a ransom? The Greek word used here comes from a verb meaning “to let loose, to release.” This term was used to describe money paid in exchange for the release of prisoners of war. Basically, then, a ransom can be defined as something paid to buy something back. In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word for “ransom” (<em>koʹpher</em>) comes from a verb meaning “to cover.” For example, God told Noah that he must “cover” (a form of the same word) the ark with tar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:14-1:6:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 6:14</a>) This helps us appreciate that to ransom also means to <em>cover</em> sins.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:3-19:65:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 65:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Significantly, the <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</em> observes that this word (<em>koʹpher</em>) “always denotes an equivalent,” or a correspondency. Thus, in order to ransom, or cover, sin, a price must be paid that fully corresponds to, or fully covers, the damage caused by the sin. God’s Law to Israel thus stated: “Life will be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:21-5:19:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Men of faith from Abel onward offered animal sacrifices to God. In so doing, they demonstrated their awareness of sin and of the need for redemption, and they showed their faith in God’s promised liberation through his “offspring.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:1-1:4:4" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 4:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:11-3:17:11" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Leviticus 17:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:4-58:11:4" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Hebrews 11:4</a>) Jehovah looked upon such sacrifices with favor and granted these worshippers a good standing. Nevertheless, animal offerings were, at best, a mere token. Animals could not really cover man’s sin, for they <span id="page142" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="142" data-before-text="142"></span>are inferior to humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:4-19:8:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 8:4-8</a>) Hence, the Bible says: “It is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>) Such sacrifices were only pictorial, or symbolic, of the true ransom sacrifice that was to come.</p>

It must be appreciated that the ransom is, not a physical exchange, but a legal transaction.

Yes, because the issue of the integrity of God’s servants had to be settled. Significantly, God did not allow the infant Jesus to be killed by Herod.
