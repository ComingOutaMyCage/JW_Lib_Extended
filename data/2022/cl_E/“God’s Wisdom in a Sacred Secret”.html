<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>SECRETS! Because they intrigue, fascinate, and mystify, humans often have difficulty keeping them confidential. However, the Bible says: “It is the glory of God to keep a matter secret.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:2-20:25:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:2</a>) Yes, as Sovereign Ruler and Creator, Jehovah rightfully keeps some things secret from mankind until it is his due time to reveal them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> However, there is a fascinating, intriguing secret that Jehovah has revealed in his Word. It is called “the sacred secret of [God’s] will.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:9-49:1:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:9</a>) Learning about it can do more than satisfy your curiosity. Knowledge of this secret can lead to salvation and can provide you with a glimpse into Jehovah’s unfathomable wisdom.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> When Adam and Eve sinned, it may have appeared that Jehovah’s purpose to have an earthly paradise inhabited by perfect humans had been thwarted. But God <em>immediately</em> addressed the problem. He said: “I will put enmity between you [the serpent] and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring. He will crush your head, and you will strike him in the heel.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> These were puzzling, cryptic words. Who was this woman? Who was the serpent? Who was the “offspring” that would crush the serpent’s head? Adam and Eve could only guess. Still, God’s words provided hope for any faithful <span id="page191" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span>offspring of that unfaithful pair. Righteousness would triumph. Jehovah’s purpose would be realized. But how? Ah, that was a mystery!

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5. Illustrate why Jehovah revealed his secret progressively.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> As the “Revealer of secrets,” Jehovah would eventually unveil pertinent details regarding the outworking of this secret. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:28-27:2:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 2:28</a>) But he would do so gradually, progressively. To illustrate, we might think of the way a loving father responds when his little boy asks, “Dad, where did I come from?” A wise father provides only as much information as that little boy can grasp. As the boy gets older, the father tells him more. In a similar way, Jehovah determines when his people are ready for revelations of his will and purpose.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Daniel 12:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> How did Jehovah make such revelations? He used a series of covenants, or contracts, to reveal much. Likely, you have at one time or another entered into some sort of a contract​—perhaps to buy a home or to borrow or lend money. Such a contract provided a legal guarantee that the terms agreed upon would be fulfilled. But why would Jehovah need to make formal covenants, or contracts, with humans? Surely, his word is a sufficient guarantee of his promises. That is true, and yet, on a number of occasions, God has kindly backed his word with legal contracts. These ironclad agreements give us imperfect humans an even more solid basis for confidence in the promises of Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:16-58:6:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:16-18</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Over two thousand years after man’s expulsion from Paradise, Jehovah told his faithful servant Abraham: “I will surely multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens . . .

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>The Covenant With Israel</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">9, 10. (a) What covenant did Jehovah make with the nation of Israel, and what protection did that covenant provide? (b) How did the Law demonstrate mankind’s need for a ransom?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> In 1513 B.C.E., Jehovah made a provision that set the scene for further revelations about the sacred secret. He concluded a covenant with Abraham’s descendants, the <span id="page193" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="193" data-before-text="193"></span>nation of Israel. Although now no longer in force, this Mosaic Law covenant was an essential part of Jehovah’s purpose to bring about the promised offspring. How so? Consider three ways. First, the Law was like a protective wall. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:14-49:2:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:14</a>) Its righteous statutes acted as a barrier between Jew and Gentile. Thus the Law helped to preserve the line of the promised offspring. Thanks largely to such protection, the nation of Israel still existed when God’s due time arrived for the Messiah to be born into the tribe of Judah.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Second, the Law thoroughly demonstrated mankind’s need for a ransom. A perfect Law, it exposed the inability of sinful humans to adhere to it fully. It thus served “to make transgressions manifest, until the offspring should arrive to whom the promise had been made.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Galatians 3:19</a>) By means of animal sacrifices, the Law offered provisional atonement for sins. But since, as Paul wrote, “it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away,” these sacrifices only foreshadowed Christ’s ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>) For faithful Jews, then, that covenant became a “guardian leading to Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:24-48:3:24" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Galatians 3:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. What glorious prospect did the Law covenant offer Israel, but why did that nation as a whole lose out?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Third, that covenant offered the nation of Israel a glorious prospect. Jehovah told them that if they proved faithful to the covenant, they would become “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:5-2:19:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>) Fleshly Israel did eventually provide the first members of a heavenly kingdom of priests. However, as a whole, Israel rebelled against the Law covenant, rejected the Messianic offspring, and lost out on that prospect. Who, then, would complete the kingdom of priests? And how would that blessed nation be related to the promised offspring? Those aspects of the sacred secret would be revealed in God’s due time.</p>

Note that Jehovah uttered a solemn oath that the Messiah would be “a priest . . . in the manner of Melchizedek.” Like Melchizedek, who served as king-priest in Abraham’s day, the coming offspring would have a direct appointment from God to serve as King <em>and</em> Priest!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:17-1:14:20" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Genesis 14:17-20</a>.</p>
