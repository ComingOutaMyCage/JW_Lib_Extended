<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">5, 6. (a) Why is God appropriately called “Jehovah of armies”? (b) How does divine warfare differ from human warfare?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Some two hundred and sixty times in the Hebrew Scriptures and twice in the Christian Greek Scriptures, God is given the title “Jehovah of armies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:11-9:1:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) As Sovereign Ruler, Jehovah commands a vast army of angelic forces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:13-6:5:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Joshua 5:13-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:22:19-11:22:19" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 22:19</a>) The destructive potential of this army is awesome. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:36-23:37:36" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 37:36</a>) The destruction of humans is not pleasant to contemplate. However, we must remember that God’s wars are unlike petty human conflicts. Military and political leaders may try to attribute noble motives to their aggression. But human war invariably involves greed and selfishness.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> In contrast, Jehovah is not driven by blind emotion. <span id="page60" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="60" data-before-text="60"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> declares: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness who is never unjust; righteous and upright is he.” God’s Word condemns unbridled rage, cruelty, and violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:7-1:49:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 49:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:5-19:11:5" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Psalm 11:5</a>) So Jehovah never acts without reason. He uses his destructive power sparingly and as a last resort. It is as he stated through his prophet Ezekiel: “‘Do I take any pleasure at all in the death of a wicked person?’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. ‘Do I not prefer that he turn away from his ways and keep living?’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:23-26:18:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Why, then, does Jehovah use destructive power? Before answering, we might call to mind the righteous man Job. Satan challenged whether Job​—really, any human—​would keep his integrity under trial. Jehovah answered that challenge by allowing Satan to test Job’s integrity. As a result, Job suffered illness, loss of wealth, and loss of his children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:2:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 1:1–2:8</a>) Unaware of the issues involved, Job mistakenly concluded that his suffering was unjust punishment from God. He asked God why He had made him a “target,” an “enemy.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:7:20-18:7:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 7:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:13:24-18:13:24" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 13:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> A young man named Elihu exposed the flaw in Job’s reasoning, saying: “Are you so convinced that you are right that you would say, ‘I am more righteous than God’?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:35:2-18:35:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 35:2</a>) Yes, it is unwise to think that we know better than God or to assume that he has behaved unfairly. “It is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly, for the Almighty to do wrong!” Elihu declared. Later, he said: “Understanding the Almighty is beyond our reach; he is great in power, and he never violates his justice and abundant righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:10-18:34:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 34:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:22-18:36:23" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 36:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:23-18:37:23" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 37:23</a>) We can <span id="page61" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span>be sure that when God fights, he has good cause for doing so. With that in mind, let us explore some of the reasons why the God of peace sometimes assumes the mantle of a warrior.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:33-46:14:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> After praising God as “a powerful warrior,” Moses declared: “Who among the gods is like you, O Jehovah? Who is like you, showing yourself mighty in holiness?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:11-2:15:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Exodus 15:11</a>) The prophet Habakkuk similarly wrote: “Your eyes are too pure to look on what is evil, and you cannot tolerate wickedness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:13-35:1:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Habakkuk 1:13</a>) Although Jehovah is a God of love, he is also a God of holiness, righteousness, and justice. At times, such qualities compel him to use his destructive power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:15-23:59:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 59:15-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:7-42:18:7" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Luke 18:7</a>) So God does not blemish his holiness when he fights. Rather, he fights <em>because</em> he is holy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:30-2:39:30" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Exodus 39:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10. How only could the enmity foretold at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> be resolved, and with what benefits to righteous mankind?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Consider the situation that arose after the first human couple, Adam and Eve, rebelled against God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a>) Had he tolerated their unrighteousness, Jehovah would have undermined his own position as Universal Sovereign. As a righteous God, he was obliged to sentence them to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>) In the first Bible prophecy, he foretold that enmity would exist between his own servants and the followers of the “serpent,” Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Genesis 3:15</a>) Ultimately, this enmity could only be resolved by the crushing of Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Romans 16:20</a>) But that judgment act would result in great blessings for righteous mankind, ridding the earth of Satan’s influence and opening the way to a global paradise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:28-40:19:28" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 19:28</a>) Until then, those who sided with Satan <span id="page62" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="62" data-before-text="62"></span>would constitute an ongoing threat to the physical and spiritual well-being of God’s people.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> The Deluge of Noah’s day was a case of such intervention. Says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:12" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Genesis 6:11, 12</a>: “The earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God, and the earth was filled with violence. Yes, God looked upon the earth, and it was ruined; all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.” Would God allow the wicked to snuff out the last vestige of morality left on earth? No. Jehovah felt obliged to bring a global deluge to rid the earth of those who were bent on violence and immorality.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12. (a) What did Jehovah foretell regarding Abraham’s “offspring”? (b) Why were the Amorites to be exterminated?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> It was similar with God’s judgment against the Canaanites. Jehovah revealed that out of Abraham would come an offspring through whom all the families of the earth would bless themselves. In harmony with that purpose, God decreed that Abraham’s descendants would be given the land of Canaan, a land inhabited by a people called the Amorites. How could God be justified in forcibly evicting these people from their land? Jehovah foretold that the eviction would not come for some 400 years​—until “the error of the Amorites” had “reached its full measure.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:1-1:12:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Genesis 12:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:13:14-1:13:15" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 13:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:13-1:15:13" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 15:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:16-1:15:16" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="29-5" class="b"> 22:18</a>) During that period of time, the Amorites sank deeper and deeper into moral corruption. Canaan became a land of idolatry, bloodshed, and degraded sexual practices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:24-2:23:24" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Exodus <span id="page63" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="63" data-before-text="63"></span>23:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:12-2:34:13" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 34:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:52-4:33:52" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Numbers 33:52</a>) The inhabitants of the land even killed children in sacrificial fires. Could a holy God expose his people to such wickedness? No! He declared: “The land is unclean, and I will bring punishment on it for its error, and the land will vomit its inhabitants out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:21-3:18:25" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Leviticus 18:21-25</a>) Jehovah did not kill the people indiscriminately, however.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Consider, again, the Israelites. As long as they were slaves in Egypt, God’s promise to Abraham that by means of his offspring all the families of the earth would bless themselves seemed empty. But by delivering them and establishing them as a nation, Jehovah cleared his name of reproach. The prophet Daniel thus addressed his God in prayer this way: “O Jehovah our God, the One who brought your people out of the land of Egypt by a mighty hand and made a name for yourself.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:15-27:9:15" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Daniel 9:15</a>.</p>

To sanctify his name and protect his people, Jehovah will once again become “a powerful warrior”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:3-38:14:3" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Zechariah 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="45-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Consider an illustration: Suppose that a man’s family was being attacked by a vicious animal and that the man jumped into the fray and killed the violent beast. Would you expect his wife and children to be repelled by this act? On the contrary, you would expect them to be moved by his selfless love for them. In a similar way, we <span id="page66" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="66" data-before-text="66"></span>should not be repelled by God’s use of destructive power. His willingness to fight to protect us should increase our love for him. Our respect for his unlimited power should deepen as well. Thus, we can “acceptably offer God sacred service with godly fear and awe.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:28-58:12:28" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:28</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20. When we read Bible accounts of divine warfare that we may not fully understand, how should we respond, and why?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Of course, the Bible does not in each case explain all the details of Jehovah’s decisions regarding divine warfare. But of this we can always be certain: Jehovah never wields destructive power in an unjust, wanton, or cruel manner. Oftentimes, considering the context of a Bible account or some background information can help us to put things into perspective. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:13</a>) Even when we do not have all the details, simply learning more about Jehovah and meditating on his precious qualities can help us to resolve any doubts that might arise. When we do this, we come to see that we have ample reason to trust our God, Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:12-18:34:12" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Job 34:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">21. While he is “a powerful warrior” at times, what is Jehovah like at heart?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> Although Jehovah is “a powerful warrior” when the situation demands it, this does not mean that he is warlike at heart. In Ezekiel’s vision of the celestial chariot, Jehovah is pictured as being prepared to fight against his enemies. Yet, Ezekiel saw God surrounded by a rainbow​—a symbol of peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:13-1:9:13" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Genesis 9:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:28-26:1:28" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:3-66:4:3" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Revelation 4:3</a>) Clearly, Jehovah is calm and peaceable. “God is love,” wrote the apostle John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="50-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) All of Jehovah’s qualities exist in perfect balance. How privileged we are, then, to be able to draw close to such a powerful yet loving God!</p>
