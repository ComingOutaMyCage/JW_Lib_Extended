TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Saul Started Out Humble and Modest




Saul was modest and hesitated to accept the kingship (1Sa 9:21; 10:20-22; w20.08 10 ¶11)
Saul did not act rashly when others spoke negatively of him (1Sa 10:27; 11:12, 13; w14 3/15 9 ¶8)
Saul responded to the leadings of Jehovah’s holy spirit (1Sa 11:5-7; w95 12/15 10 ¶1)





Humility will help us to view our privileges and abilities as gifts from Jehovah. (Ro 12:3, 16; 1Co 4:7) Also, if we are humble, we will continue to rely on Jehovah for guidance.
