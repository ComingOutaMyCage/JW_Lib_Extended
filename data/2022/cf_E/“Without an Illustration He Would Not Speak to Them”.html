<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE disciples traveling with Jesus have a rare privilege. They are learning directly from the Great Teacher. They get to hear his voice as he opens up the meaning of God’s Word and teaches them thrilling truths. For now, they must carry his precious sayings in their minds and hearts; it is not yet the time for his words to be preserved in writing.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> However, Jesus makes it easier for them to remember what he teaches. How? By his way of teaching, especially his masterful use of illustrations.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Indeed, effective illustrations are not quickly forgotten. One author noted that illustrations “turn ears into eyes” and that they “free listeners to think with pictures in their heads.” Because we often think best in pictures, illustrations can make even abstract ideas easier to grasp. Illustrations can bring words to life, teaching us lessons that become etched in our memory.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">4, 5. Why did Jesus use illustrations?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The Bible gives two important reasons why Jesus used illustrations. First, his doing so fulfilled prophecy. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:34-40:13:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 13:34, 35</a>, we read: “Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations. Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them, in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet who said: ‘I will open my mouth with illustrations.’” The prophet mentioned by Matthew was the writer of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:2-19:78:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 78:2</a>. That psalmist wrote under the inspiration of God’s spirit centuries before Jesus’ birth. Consider what this means. Hundreds of years in advance, Jehovah determined that the Messiah would teach with illustrations. Surely, then, Jehovah must value this method of teaching.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Second, Jesus explained that he used illustrations to sift out those whose hearts had “grown unreceptive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:10-40:13:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 13:10-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:9-23:6:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isaiah 6:9, 10</a>) What was it about his illustrations that exposed the motives of people? In some cases, he wanted his listeners to ask for an explanation in order to get the full meaning of his words. Humble individuals were willing to ask, whereas haughty or indifferent ones were not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:36-40:13:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 13:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:34-41:4:34" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mark 4:34</a>) Jesus’ illustrations, then, <em>revealed</em> truth to those whose hearts hungered for it; at the same time, his illustrations <em>concealed</em> truth from those with proud hearts.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. Jesus’ illustrations served what beneficial purposes?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jesus’ illustrations served a number of other beneficial purposes. They aroused interest, compelling people to listen. They painted mental images that were easy to grasp. As noted at the outset, Jesus’ illustrations helped his listeners to remember his words. The Sermon on the Mount, as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:7:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3–7:27</a>, is an outstanding example <span id="page120" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="120" data-before-text="120"></span>of Jesus’ generous use of word pictures. According to one count, this sermon contains over 50 figures of speech. To put that in perspective, keep in mind that this sermon can be read aloud in about 20 minutes. At that rate, a figure of speech is uttered, on average, nearly every 20 seconds! Clearly, Jesus saw the value of painting a picture with words!</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 7. Why imitate Jesus’ use of illustrations?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> As followers of Christ, we want to imitate his way of teaching, including his use of illustrations. Like the seasonings that make a meal more appetizing, effective illustrations can make our teaching more appealing to others. Well-thought-out word pictures can also make important truths easier to grasp. Let us now take a closer look at some of the factors that made Jesus’ illustrations so effective. Then we will be able to see how we can put this valuable teaching method to good use.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">8, 9. How did Jesus make use of simple comparisons, and what made the comparisons he drew so effective?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> In his teaching, Jesus often used comparisons that were uncomplicated, requiring just a few words. Yet, the simple words painted vivid mental images and clearly taught important spiritual truths. For example, when urging his disciples not to be anxious over daily needs, he pointed to “the birds of heaven” and “the lilies of the field.” The birds do not sow and reap, nor do the lilies spin and weave. Still, God cares for them. The point is easy to see​—namely, that if God takes care of birds and flowers, surely he will look after humans who “keep . . . seeking first the Kingdom.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:26-40:6:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 6:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:28-40:6:33" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 28-33</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Jesus also made generous use of metaphors, which are even more forceful comparisons. A metaphor refers to <span id="page121" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="121" data-before-text="121"></span>one thing as if it <em>were</em> another. Here, again, he kept the comparisons simple. On one occasion, he told his disciples: “You are the light of the world.” The disciples could hardly miss the point of the metaphor, namely, that through their words and deeds, they could let the light of spiritual truth shine and help others to give glory to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 5:14-16</a>) Note some other metaphors used by Jesus: “You are the salt of the earth” and “I am the vine; you are the branches.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:13-40:5:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 5:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:5-43:15:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 15:5</a>) Such figures of speech are powerful in their simplicity.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10. What are some examples that show how you can use illustrations in your teaching?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> How can you use illustrations in your teaching? You do not have to come up with long, elaborate stories. Just try to think of simple comparisons. Imagine that you are discussing the subject of the resurrection and that you want to illustrate that raising the dead poses no problem for Jehovah. What comparison comes to mind? The Bible uses sleep as a metaphor for death. You might say, “God can resurrect the dead as easily as we can awaken someone from sleep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 11:11-14</a>) Suppose that you want to illustrate that children need love and affection if they are to thrive. What example could you use? The Bible uses this comparison: Children are “like shoots of an olive tree.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:128:3-19:128:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 128:3</a>) You could say, “Love and affection are to a child what sunshine and water are to a tree.” The simpler the comparison, the easier it will be for your listeners to get the point.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Jesus was a master at using illustrations that related to the lives of people. Many of his illustrations reflected <span id="page122" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="122" data-before-text="122"></span>everyday circumstances that he had likely observed while growing up in Galilee. Think, for a moment, about his early life. How often did he see his mother grind grain into flour, add leaven to dough, light a lamp, or sweep the house? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:33-40:13:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 13:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:41-40:24:41" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 24:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:8-42:15:8" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Luke 15:8</a>) How many times did he watch the fishermen as they let down their nets into the Sea of Galilee? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:47-40:13:47" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 13:47</a>) How often did he observe children playing in the marketplace? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:16-40:11:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 11:16</a>) Jesus no doubt saw other commonplace things that are mentioned in his many illustrations​—seeds being sown, joyful wedding feasts, and grain fields ripening in the sun.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:3-40:13:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 13:3-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:1-40:25:12" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 25:1-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:26-41:4:29" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Mark 4:26-29</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12, 13. Why is it significant that Jesus used the road that went “from Jerusalem to Jericho” to make his point in the parable of the neighborly Samaritan?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> In his illustrations, Jesus mentioned details that were well-known to his listeners. For example, he began the parable of the neighborly Samaritan by saying: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell victim to robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went off, leaving him half-dead.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:30-42:10:30" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 10:30</a>) Significantly, Jesus referred to the road that went “from Jerusalem to Jericho” to make his point. When relating this parable, he was in Judea, not far from Jerusalem; so his listeners undoubtedly knew about the road in question. That road was known to be dangerous, especially for someone traveling alone. It wound through lonely terrain, providing many lurking places for robbers.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Jesus included other familiar details about the road that went “from Jerusalem to Jericho.” According to the parable, first a priest and then a Levite were also traveling that road​—although neither stopped to help the victim. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:31-42:10:32" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 10:31, 32</a>) The priests served at the temple in Jerusalem, and the Levites assisted them. Many priests and <span id="page123" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="123" data-before-text="123"></span>Levites resided in Jericho when they were not working at the temple; Jericho was only 14 miles (23 km) from Jerusalem. Hence, they could be seen on that road. Note, too, that Jesus spoke of the traveler as “going down”​—not up—​the road “from Jerusalem.” This made sense to his listeners. Jerusalem was higher in elevation than Jericho. Therefore, when traveling “from Jerusalem,” a traveler would indeed be “going down.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Jesus clearly kept his listeners in mind.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">14. When using illustrations, how can we keep our audience in mind?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> When we use illustrations, we too need to keep our audience in mind. What are some things about our listeners that might have a bearing on our choice of illustrations? Perhaps such factors as age, cultural or family background, and <span id="page124" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="124" data-before-text="124"></span>occupation come into play. For instance, an illustration that mentions details about farming might be more readily understood in an agricultural area than in a large city. The everyday life and activities of our hearers​—their children, their house, their hobbies, their food—​might also provide the basis for fitting illustrations.</p>

While growing up in Galilee, he no doubt had ample opportunity to observe creation. More significantly, Jesus is “the firstborn of all creation,” and in creating all things, Jehovah used him as the “master worker.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:31" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Proverbs 8:30, 31</a>) Is it any wonder that Jesus was intimately acquainted with creation?

He knew that there was a unique bond between shepherds and their sheep. He noted that these trusting creatures readily allowed themselves to be led and that they faithfully followed their shepherd. Why do sheep follow their shepherd? “Because they know his voice,” said Jesus.
