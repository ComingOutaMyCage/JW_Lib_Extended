<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IT IS a spring day in 31 C.E. Jesus Christ is near Capernaum, a bustling city on the northwest shores of the Sea of Galilee. Up on a mountain in the vicinity, Jesus has prayed in solitude the entire night. As the morning unfolds, he calls his disciples, and from among them he chooses 12, whom he names apostles. Meanwhile, great crowds of people​—some from considerable distances—​have followed Jesus to this location and are assembled at a level place on the mountain. They are eager to hear what he has to say and to be healed of their ailments. Jesus does not disappoint them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:12-42:6:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 6:12-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jesus approaches the crowds and heals all who are sick. Finally, when not one among them feels the pain of serious illness, he sits down and begins to teach.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> His words spoken in the spring air that day must surprise his listeners. After all, they have never heard anyone teach as he does. To give weight to his teachings, he appeals neither to oral traditions nor to well-known Jewish rabbis. Rather, he repeatedly quotes the inspired Hebrew Scriptures. His message is straightforward, his wording simple, his meaning clear. When he is finished, the crowds are astounded. <span id="page48" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>Indeed, they should be. They have just listened to the wisest man who ever lived!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:28-40:7:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>.</p>

We do well to dig into what that inspired record says about Jesus, for in him are “all the treasures of wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:3-51:2:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 2:3</a>) Where did he get such wisdom​—the ability to put knowledge and understanding to work in a practical way?

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 4. What question did Jesus’ listeners in Nazareth raise, and why?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> During one of his preaching tours, Jesus visited Nazareth, the town where he had been reared, and began teaching in the synagogue there. Many of his listeners were amazed and wondered: “Where did this man get this wisdom?” They knew his family​—his parents and siblings—​and they were aware that he had come from humble circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:54-40:13:56" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 13:54-56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:1-41:6:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mark 6:1-3</a>) They no doubt also knew that this eloquent carpenter had not attended any of the prestigious rabbinic schools. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:15-43:7:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 7:15</a>) Their question thus seemed logical.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5. Jesus revealed that his wisdom was from what Source?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The wisdom Jesus manifested was not simply the product of his perfect mind. Later in his ministry, when teaching openly in the temple, Jesus revealed that his wisdom was from a far loftier source. “What I teach is not mine,” he said, “but belongs to him who sent me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:16-43:7:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 7:16</a>) Yes, the Father, who sent forth the Son, was the real Source of Jesus’ wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:49-43:12:49" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 12:49</a>) How, though, did Jesus receive wisdom from Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">6, 7. In what ways did Jesus receive wisdom from his Father?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s holy spirit was at work in Jesus’ heart and mind. Concerning Jesus as the promised Messiah, Isaiah <span id="page49" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="49" data-before-text="49"></span>foretold: “The spirit of Jehovah will settle upon him, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of mightiness, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:2-23:11:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:2</a>) With Jehovah’s spirit resting upon him and guiding his thinking and decisions, is it any wonder that Jesus’ words and actions reflected superlative wisdom?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Jesus gained wisdom from his Father in another profound way. As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102007042/">Chapter 2</a>, during his prehuman existence, which spanned countless ages, Jesus had the opportunity to absorb his Father’s thoughts on matters. We cannot begin to imagine the depth of wisdom that the Son gained at his Father’s side, laboring as God’s “master worker” in the creation of all other things, both animate and inanimate. For good reason, the Son in his prehuman existence is described as wisdom personified. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:22-20:8:31" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:22-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:15, 16</a>) Throughout his ministry, Jesus was able to draw on the wisdom he had gained alongside his Father in heaven.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:26-43:8:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 8:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:28-43:8:28" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:38-43:8:38" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 38</a>) Therefore, we need hardly be surprised at the breadth of knowledge and depth of understanding reflected in Jesus’ words or at the soundness of judgment evident in his every deed.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 8. As followers of Jesus, how may we gain wisdom?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> As followers of Jesus, we too need to look to Jehovah as the Source of wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:6-20:2:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:6</a>) Of course, Jehovah does not impart miraculous wisdom to us. He does, however, answer our earnest prayers for the wisdom necessary to deal successfully with the challenges of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">James 1:5</a>) To gain that wisdom requires much effort on our part. We need to keep seeking for it “as for hidden treasures.” <span id="page50" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1-6</a>) Yes, we need to continue digging deep down into God’s Word, wherein his wisdom is revealed, and to bring our life into harmony with what we learn. The example of Jehovah’s Son is especially valuable in helping us to acquire wisdom. Let us examine several areas in which Jesus manifested wisdom and learn how we can imitate him.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> People in great numbers flocked to Jesus just to hear him speak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:31-41:6:34" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 6:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:1-42:5:3" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Luke 5:1-3</a>) And no wonder, for when Jesus opened his mouth, words of surpassing wisdom issued forth! His teachings reflected a deep knowledge of God’s Word and a matchless ability to get to the heart of matters. His teachings are universal in their appeal and timeless in their application. Consider some examples of the wisdom found in the words of Jesus, the foretold “Wonderful Counselor.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">10. What positive qualities does Jesus urge us to cultivate, and why?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> The Sermon on the Mount, referred to at the outset, is the largest collection of Jesus’ teachings not interrupted by narrative or the words of others. In this sermon, Jesus does not simply advise <span id="page51" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="51" data-before-text="51"></span>us to pursue proper speech and conduct. His counsel goes much deeper than that. Well aware that thoughts and feelings lead to words and actions, Jesus urges us to cultivate positive qualities of mind and heart, such as mildness of temper, a hunger for righteousness, an inclination to be merciful and peaceable, and love for others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:5-40:5:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:43-40:5:48" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 43-48</a>) As we build up such qualities in our heart, the result will be wholesome speech and conduct that not only please Jehovah but also promote good relationships with fellow humans.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:16-40:5:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 5:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> When giving counsel on sinful behavior, Jesus gets to the very root of the matter. He does not simply tell us to refrain from violent acts. Rather, he warns us not to allow anger to smolder in our heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:21-40:5:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 5:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:15-62:3:15" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:15</a>) He does not only forbid the act of adultery. Instead, he warns of the passion that begins in the heart and leads to such betrayal. He admonishes us not to allow our eyes to arouse improper desire and stimulate lust. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:27-40:5:30" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 5:27-30</a>) Jesus deals with causes, not just symptoms.

We seek to cultivate the positive qualities he recommended​—including mercy, peaceableness, and love—​knowing that we will thus be laying a foundation for godly conduct. We endeavor to root out of our heart the negative feelings and desires he warned against, such as bitter anger and immoral longings, knowing that doing so will help us to avoid sinful conduct.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b">James 1:14, 15</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Wisdom includes sound judgment. <em>Jesus used good judgment in choosing his life course.</em> Can you imagine the life that he could have made for himself​—the home he could have constructed, the business he could have built up, or the worldly prominence he could have achieved? Jesus knew that a life devoted to those pursuits “is futility, a chasing after the wind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:4-21:4:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:10-21:5:10" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 5:10</a>) Such a course is foolishness, the opposite of wisdom.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:20-40:8:20" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 8:20</a>) In line with what he taught, he kept his eye focused on a single purpose​—the doing of God’s will.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> The Gospel accounts of Jesus’ life and ministry truly are a treasure trove of wisdom! What should we do with this priceless gift? At the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus urged his audience not just to <em>hear</em> his wise sayings but also to <em>do,</em> or apply, them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:24-40:7:27" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Matthew 7:24-27</a>) Molding our thoughts, motivations, and actions according to Jesus’ wise words and deeds will help us to find the best possible life now and to stay on the road to everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>) Surely there is no better or wiser course that we could take!</p>
