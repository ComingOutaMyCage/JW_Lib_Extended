SECTION 3
“The Love the Christ Has Compels Us”




What motivates us to keep following Jesus? The apostle Paul answers: “The love the Christ has compels us.” (2 Corinthians 5:14) In this section we will study the love that Jesus has​—for Jehovah, for mankind, and for us as individuals. Such a study is truly compelling. Our hearts are touched, and we feel compelled to act, to make progress in following our Master’s example.
