<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>HAVE you ever been lost? You may recall an occasion when you were traveling to visit a friend or a relative and could not find the way. As you proceeded along an unfamiliar road, did you stop and ask someone for directions? Imagine how you would feel if, instead of just telling you which way to go, a benevolent individual said: “Just follow me. I will lead you there.” How relieved you would be!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> In a sense, Jesus Christ does something like that for us. On our own, approach to God would be impossible. Because of inherited sin and imperfection, the world of mankind is lost, “alienated from the life that belongs to God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:17-49:4:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:17, 18</a>) We need help to find our way. Jesus, our benevolent Exemplar, does not just offer advice and directions; he does more. As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102007041/">Chapter 1</a>, Jesus invites us, saying: “Come be my follower.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:21-41:10:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 10:21</a>) However, he also gives us compelling reason to accept that invitation. On one occasion, Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) Let us discuss some reasons why approach to the Father is possible only through the Son. Then with those reasons in mind, we will consider how Jesus is, indeed, “the way and the truth and the life.”</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> First and foremost, approach to God is through Jesus because Jehovah has seen fit to give his Son the most important role.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The Father has made him the central, or key, figure in the outworking of all of His purposes.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. The rebellion in Eden raised what issue, and what did Jehovah determine to do in order to settle the issue?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The rebellion in Eden raised an issue of universal importance: Is the one who bears the name Jehovah really holy, good, righteous, and loving in all his ways? To settle this vital issue, Jehovah determined that a perfect spirit son would have to go to earth. The mission that this son would carry out could not have been weightier​—giving his life to sanctify his Father’s name and to serve as a ransom to save humankind. By remaining faithful to death, the son chosen would make it possible to solve all the problems raised by Satan’s rebellion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:14-58:2:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:8-62:3:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:8</a>) But Jehovah had millions upon millions of perfect spirit sons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 7:9, 10</a>) Which one did he select to carry out this most important assignment? Jehovah chose his “only-begotten Son,” the one who later came to be known as Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">5, 6. How did Jehovah demonstrate that he had confidence in his Son, and on what was this confidence based?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Should we be surprised at Jehovah’s choice? By no <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>means! The Father had the utmost confidence in his only-begotten Son. Centuries in advance of the arrival of his Son on earth, Jehovah foretold that this Son would remain loyal despite undergoing all manner of suffering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:3-23:53:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:3-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:10-23:53:12" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:32-44:8:35" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Acts 8:32-35</a>) Consider the implications of that. The Son, like all other intelligent creatures, had free will, the ability to choose his own course. Yet, Jehovah had such confidence that he foretold the faithfulness of his Son. On what was this confidence based? In a word, knowledge. Jehovah knows his Son intimately and knows how much his Son wants to please Him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:29-43:8:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 8:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:31-43:14:31" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14:31</a>) The Son loves his Father, and in turn, Jehovah loves His Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:35-43:3:35" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 3:35</a>) The love that Father and Son have for each other forges between them a bond of unity and trust that is unbreakable.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:14-51:3:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Colossians 3:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> In view of the important role of the Son, the confidence that the Father has in him, and the love that binds the Father and the Son together, is it any wonder that approach to God is possible only through Jesus? Yet, there is another reason why the Son alone can lead us to the Father.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">7, 8. Why could Jesus correctly say that no one fully knows the Father “except the Son”?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We must meet certain requirements if we are to gain access to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:1-19:15:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-5</a>) Who knows better than the Son what it takes to meet God’s standards and to have His approval? Jesus said: “All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:27-40:11:27" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 11:27</a>) Let us see why <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>Jesus could say, correctly and without exaggerating, that no one fully knows the Father “except the Son.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> As “the firstborn of all creation,” the Son has a unique relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15</a>) Imagine the closeness of the Father-Son relationship that developed during the untold ages when it was just the two of them​—from the dawn of creation until other spirit creatures were brought into existence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:17" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:16, 17</a>) Just think about the precious opportunity the Son had alongside his Father, absorbing the Father’s thoughts on matters and learning His will, standards, and ways. Truly, it is by no means an overstatement to say that Jesus knows his Father better than anyone else does. This closeness surely enabled Jesus to reveal his Father in ways that no one else could.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">9, 10. (a) In what ways did Jesus reveal his Father? (b) To have Jehovah’s approval, what must we do?</p>

Consider, more specifically, what this means for us. Jesus is “the way” in that only through him can we enter into an approved relationship with God. Why is that so? By proving faithful to death, Jesus gave his life as a ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) Without this ransom provision, it would be impossible for us to have access to God.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:15-43:13:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">John 13:15</a>) The study aid that you are now reading can help you in this endeavor.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">19, 20. What does this study aid contain that can help you in your endeavor to follow Christ?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> In the chapters that follow, we will make a careful study of the life and ministry of Jesus. These chapters are divided into three sections. First, we will get an overview of his qualities and ways. Second, we will examine <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>his zealous example in preaching and teaching. Third, we will consider how he manifested love. Starting with <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102007044/">Chapter 3</a>, there is a teaching box entitled “How Can You Follow Jesus?” The scriptures and questions therein are designed to help us meditate on how we can imitate Jesus in word and deed.</p>

At great cost to himself, Jehovah lovingly sent forth his Son to show us the way to come into an approved relationship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>) May you be moved, yes, impelled, to respond to that great love by accepting and acting upon Jesus’ invitation: “Be my follower.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:43-43:1:43" data-bid="46-1" class="b">John 1:43</a>.</p>
