<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Carpenter. Miracle worker. Healer. Jesus was all of these and more. Yet, people did not use such terms when addressing him. They called him Teacher. Indeed, his lifework was “teaching . . . and preaching the good news.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:23-40:4:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 4:23</a>) As followers of Jesus, we have the same work to do. In this section, we will study his example, which shows us the way.</p>
