(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:5-43:19:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 19:5</a>) Just a few days earlier, Jesus was hailed by the crowds when he made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem as the divinely appointed King.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jesus is decked with a purple robe like that worn by royalty, and he has a crown upon his head. But the robe, draped over the ribbons of bleeding flesh on his scourged back, and the crown, braided of thorns and pressed into his now-bloodied scalp, are in mockery of his royal status. The people, incited by the chief priests, reject the battered man standing before them. The priests shout: “To the stake with him! To the stake with him!” With murder in their hearts, the people cry out: “He ought to die.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:1-43:19:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 19:1-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> As the promised Messiah, Jesus knew what to expect. He was aware of the many prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures that foretold in detail the Messiah’s suffering and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:3-23:53:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:3-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:12-23:53:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:26-27:9:26" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Daniel 9:26</a>) More than once, he prepared his disciples for the trials that awaited him.

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. Why was it necessary for Jesus to suffer and die?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Why, though, was it necessary for Jesus to suffer and die? For several profoundly significant reasons. First, by keeping loyal, Jesus would prove his integrity and sanctify Jehovah’s name. Recall that Satan falsely claimed that humans serve God only out of selfish interest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:1-18:2:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 2:1-5</a>) <span id="page175" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="175" data-before-text="175"></span>By remaining faithful “to the point of death . . . on a torture stake,” Jesus gave the most conclusive answer possible to Satan’s baseless charge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:8-50:2:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Philippians 2:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Proverbs 27:11</a>) Second, the Messiah’s suffering and death would provide atonement for the sins of others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:5-23:53:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:10-23:53:10" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:24" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Daniel 9:24</a>) Jesus gave “his life as a ransom in exchange for many,” opening the way for us to have an approved relationship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) Third, by enduring all manner of hardships and suffering, Jesus had been “tested in all respects as we have.” He is thus a compassionate High Priest, one who is able to “sympathize with our weaknesses.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:17-58:2:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:15-58:4:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 4:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> To put into perspective what Jesus was willing to do, think about this: What man would leave his family and home and move to a foreign land if he knew that most of its inhabitants would reject him, that he would be subjected to humiliation and suffering, and that he would finally be murdered? Consider now what Jesus did. Before coming to earth, he had a favored position in the heavens alongside his Father. Yet, Jesus willingly left his heavenly home and came to earth as a human. He made this move, knowing that he would be rejected by the majority and that he would be subjected to cruel humiliation, intense suffering, and a painful death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:5-50:2:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Philippians 2:5-7</a>) What motivated Jesus to make such a sacrifice?</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Above all, Jesus was impelled by deep love for his Father. Jesus’ endurance was evidence of his love for Jehovah. That love caused Jesus to be concerned about his Father’s name and reputation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:1-43:17:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> John 17:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> <span id="page176" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="176" data-before-text="176"></span>26</a>) More than anything, Jesus wanted to see his Father’s name cleared of the reproach that had been heaped upon it. Jesus thus counted it the highest honor and privilege to suffer for righteousness’ sake, for he knew that his integrity would play a part in sanctifying his Father’s good and beautiful name.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:13-13:29:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Jesus had another motive for laying down his life—love for humankind. This is a love that goes back to the very beginning of human history. Long before Jesus came to earth, the Bible reveals that he felt this way: “I was especially fond of the sons of men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:31" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:30, 31</a>) His love was clearly evident when he was on earth. As we saw in the preceding three chapters of this book, in many ways Jesus showed his love for humans in general and for his followers in particular. But on Nisan 14, 33 C.E., he willingly gave his life in our behalf. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:11-43:10:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 10:11</a>) Truly, there was no greater way for him to demonstrate his love for us. Are we to imitate him in this regard? Yes. In fact, we are commanded to do so.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10, 11. What is the new commandment that Jesus gave his followers, what does it involve, and why is it important that we obey it?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> The night before he died, Jesus told his closest disciples: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples—if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) “Love one another”—why is that “a new commandment”? The Mosaic Law had already commanded: “You must love your fellow man [or, neighbor] as yourself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:18</a>) But the new commandment calls for a greater love, a love that would move us to give our own <span id="page177" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="177" data-before-text="177"></span>life in behalf of others. Jesus himself made this clear when he said: “This is my commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you. No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:12-43:15:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 15:12, 13</a>) The new commandment, in effect, says: “Love others, not <em>as</em> yourself, but <em>more than</em> yourself.” By his life and death, Jesus certainly exemplified such love.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Why is it important that we obey the new commandment? Recall that Jesus said: “By this [self-sacrificing love] all will know that you are my disciples.” Yes, self-sacrificing love identifies us as true Christians. We might compare this love to an identification badge. Delegates attending the annual conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses wear badge cards. The card identifies the wearer, showing his name and congregation. Self-sacrificing love for one another is the “badge” that identifies genuine Christians. In other words, the love we show one another should be so noticeable that it would serve as a sign, or badge, telling observers that we are indeed true followers of Christ. Each of us does well to ask himself, ‘Is the “badge” of self-sacrificing love evident in my life?’</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> As followers of Jesus, we need to love one another as he loved us. This means being willing to make sacrifices for fellow believers. How far must we be willing to go? The Bible tells us: “By this we have come to know love, because that one surrendered his life for us, and we are under obligation to surrender our lives for our brothers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:16-62:3:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 John 3:16</a>) Like Jesus, we must be willing to die for one <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>another if necessary. In times of persecution, we would rather sacrifice our own life than betray our spiritual brothers and thus endanger their lives. In lands divided by racial or ethnic strife, we would risk our own lives to protect our brothers, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. When nations go to war, we would sooner face imprisonment or even death than take up weapons against fellow believers—or anyone else for that matter.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 17:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:10-62:3:12" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:10-12</a>.</p>

After all, few of us are ever called upon to make such a great sacrifice. However, if we love our brothers enough to die for them, should we not be willing to make smaller sacrifices, going out of our way to help them now? To be self-sacrificing means to give up our own advantage or comfort for the benefit of others. We put their needs and welfare ahead of our own even if it is not convenient.

Others serve as Local <span id="page179" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="179" data-before-text="179"></span>Design/Construction volunteers.

Surely it is a sacrifice for a wife when her husband needs to devote to congregation matters time that he might otherwise spend with his family. Think, too, of the wives of circuit overseers and the sacrifices they make to accompany their husbands from congregation to congregation and from circuit to circuit. They forgo having a home of their own and perhaps at times have to sleep in a different bed each week.

Yet, someone else has shown us even greater love. Jesus explained: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) God loves us so much that he gave his Son as a ransom, making it possible for us to be delivered from sin and death.
