<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>AS HE gathers his apostles in an upper room of a house in Jerusalem, Jesus knows that this is his last evening with them. The time is near for him to return to his Father. In a matter of hours, Jesus will be arrested and his faith tested as never before. Yet, not even his impending death can distract him from the needs of the apostles.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jesus has prepared the apostles for his departure, but he still has more to say to strengthen them for what lies ahead. So he spends these last precious moments teaching them vital lessons that will help them to remain faithful. His words are among the warmest and most intimate that he has ever shared with them. Why, though, is Jesus more concerned about his apostles than about himself? Why are these final hours with them so dear to him? The answer is, in a word, love. His love for them is profound.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 3. How do we know that Jesus did not wait until his final evening to show love to his followers?</p>

We do well to examine some of the ways he showed his love, for by imitating <span id="page162" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="162" data-before-text="162"></span>him in this regard, we prove ourselves his genuine disciples.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Love and patience go together. “Love is patient,” observes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>, and patience involves putting up with others. Did Jesus need patience in dealing with his disciples? Indeed, he did! As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102007044/">Chapter 3</a>, the apostles were slow to cultivate humility. More than once, they got into arguments about who was the greatest among them. How did Jesus react? Did he get angry and respond with irritation or resentment? No, he patiently reasoned with them, even when “a heated dispute” over this issue arose on his last evening with them!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:24-42:22:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 22:24-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:20-40:20:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 20:20-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:33-41:9:37" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Mark 9:33-37</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Later on that final night, when Jesus went to the garden of Gethsemane with the 11 faithful apostles, his patience was tested yet again. Leaving eight of the apostles, Jesus took Peter, James, and John deeper into the garden. “I am deeply grieved, even to death,” Jesus told them. “Stay here and keep on the watch.” He went a short distance away and began praying fervently. After praying at length, he returned to the three apostles. What did he find? In this, his hour of greatest trial, they were fast asleep! Did he berate them for their lack of vigilance? No, he patiently exhorted them. His kind words showed an understanding of the stress they had been under and of their weaknesses.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> “The spirit, of course, is eager,” he said, “but the flesh is weak.” <span id="page163" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="163" data-before-text="163"></span>Jesus remained patient that evening, even when he came and found them asleep not one but two more times!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:36-40:26:46" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 26:36-46</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> It is encouraging to note that Jesus did not give up on his apostles. His patience eventually bore fruit, for these faithful men learned the importance of being both humble and vigilant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:7-60:4:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4:7</a>) How can we imitate Jesus in our dealings with others? Elders especially need to exercise patience. Fellow believers may approach an elder with their problems when the elder himself is tired out or distracted by his own concerns. At times, those in need of help may be slow to respond to counsel. Nevertheless, patient elders will instruct “with mildness” and will “treat the flock with tenderness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:24-55:2:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:29" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Acts 20:28, 29</a>) Parents also do well to imitate Jesus in showing patience, for at times children may be slow to respond to counsel or correction. Love and patience will help parents not to give up in their efforts to train their children. The rewards of such patience can be great indeed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a>.</p>

Picture the scene. Jesus was on the stake, suffering excruciating pain. In order to draw breath, he evidently had to push himself up with his feet. This no doubt caused him severe pain as the weight of his body tore at the nail wounds in his feet and his scourged back rubbed against the stake. Speech, which involves breath control, must have been difficult and painful. Yet, just before he died, Jesus spoke words that showed his deep love for his mother, Mary. Seeing Mary and the apostle John standing nearby, Jesus, in a voice loud enough for bystanders to hear, said to his mother: “Woman, see! Your son!” Then to John, he said: “See!

Yet, that same night when Jesus was betrayed and taken into custody, Peter and the other apostles abandoned Jesus and fled. Later, Peter proved brave enough to stand outside while Jesus was illegally tried. Still, Peter then became fearful and made a serious mistake​—three times he lyingly denied that he even knew Jesus!

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Jesus was prepared to forgive Peter.

Our showing trust and confidence in fellow believers is an expression of our love. Let us remember that love is positive, not negative. When others disappoint <span id="page171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>us, which is bound to happen from time to time, love will keep us from quickly assuming that their motives are bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:1-40:7:2" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Matthew 7:1, 2</a>) If we keep a positive view of our fellow believers, we will treat them in ways that build up rather than tear down.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Can we imitate Jesus’ willingness to delegate? It is beneficial for those who have positions of responsibility in the congregation to delegate appropriate and meaningful tasks to others, trusting them to do their best. Experienced elders can thereby provide necessary and valuable training for qualified younger men who are “reaching out” to help in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:1-54:3:1" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:2-55:2:2" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 2:2</a>) This training is vital. As Jehovah continues to speed up Kingdom growth, qualified men will need to be trained to care for the increase.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Jesus provided us with a marvelous example in showing love to others. Of all the ways that we can follow him, imitating his love is the most important. In the next chapter, we will discuss the greatest expression of his love for us​—his willingness to give his life.</p>

It means, rather, that love is not unduly critical or suspicious. Love refrains from hastily judging the motives of others or concluding the worst about them.</p></div>
