<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE year is 36 C.E. The autumn sun warms Peter as he prays on the flat rooftop of a house near the sea in the harbor city of Joppa. He has been a guest in this home for some days now. His willingness to stay here reveals, to an extent, an unprejudiced attitude. The owner, a certain Simon, is a tanner by trade, and not every Jew would lodge with such a man.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Still, Peter is about to learn a vital lesson regarding Jehovah’s impartiality.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> While Peter is praying, he falls into a trance. What he sees in a vision would disturb any Jew. Descending from heaven is a sheetlike vessel containing animals unclean according to the Law. Told to slaughter and eat, Peter replies: “I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.” Not once but three times he is told: “Stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:14-44:10:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 10:14-16</a>) The vision leaves Peter confused but not for long.</p>

It is important that we grasp its significance, for at the heart of this vision is a profound truth about the way Jehovah views people. As true Christians, we cannot bear thorough witness about God’s Kingdom unless we learn to share God’s view of people. To unlock the meaning of Peter’s vision, let us examine the dramatic events that surrounded it.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> No doubt eager to report what had happened, Peter headed for Jerusalem. Evidently, the news that uncircumcised Gentiles had “accepted the word of God” preceded him. Soon after Peter arrived, “the supporters of circumcision began to criticize him.” They were disturbed because he had entered “the house of men who were not circumcised and ate with them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:1-44:11:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 11:1-3</a>) The issue was not whether Gentiles could become followers of Christ. Rather, those Jewish disciples were really insisting that Gentiles needed to observe the Law​—including circumcision<span id="page73" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="73" data-before-text="73"></span>—​in order to worship Jehovah acceptably. Clearly, some Jewish disciples had difficulty letting go of the Mosaic Law.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> How did Peter explain his actions? According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:4-44:11:16" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 11:4-16</a>, he recounted four evidences of heavenly direction: (1) the divine vision he had received (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:4-44:11:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Verses 4-10</a>); (2) the spirit’s command (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:11-44:11:12" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Verses 11, 12</a>); (3) the angel’s visit to Cornelius (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:13-44:11:14" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Verses 13, 14</a>); and (4) the pouring out of the holy spirit upon the Gentiles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:15-44:11:16" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Verses 15, 16</a>) Peter concluded with a most compelling question: “If, therefore, God gave the same free gift [of holy spirit] to them [believing Gentiles] that he gave to us [Jews] who have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I should be able to hinder God?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:17-44:11:17" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 11:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Peter’s testimony posed a crucial test for those Jewish Christians. Would they be able to put aside any traces of prejudice and accept the newly baptized Gentiles as their fellow Christians? The account tells us: “When they [the apostles and other Jewish Christians] heard these things, they stopped objecting, and they glorified God, saying: ‘So, then, God has also granted to people of the nations repentance leading to life.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:18-44:11:18" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Acts 11:18</a>) That positive attitude preserved the unity of the congregation.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:4-44:13:4" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Acts 13:4</a>) Seleucus I Nicator, first ruler of the Seleucid Empire, founded Antioch in 300 B.C.E. As the capital of that empire, Antioch soon acquired great importance. In 64 B.C.E., Roman General Pompey made Syria a Roman province, with Antioch as its capital. By the first century C.E., the metropolis ranked third in size and wealth among the cities of the Roman Empire, after Rome and Alexandria.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">Antioch was a commercial as well as a political center. The wares of all of Syria passed through it before being exported to the rest of the Mediterranean basin. “Since it was near the frontier between the settled Graeco-Roman area and the eastern states,” says one scholar, “it was even more cosmopolitan than most Hellenistic cities.” There was a large Jewish community in Antioch, and according to Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, they “made proselytes of a great many of the Greeks” who lived there.</p>

As people of the nations became Christians, did a bond of brotherhood form <span id="page76" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="76" data-before-text="76"></span>between Jewish and Gentile believers? Consider what happened when a great famine occurred about 46 C.E.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span id="footnotesource5" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span> In ancient times, famines sorely affected the poor, who had neither reserves of money nor extra food. During this famine, the Jewish Christians living in Judea, many of whom apparently were poor, were in need of provisions. Learning of the need, the brothers in Antioch​—including Gentile Christians—​sent “relief to the brothers living in Judea.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:29-44:11:29" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Acts 11:29</a>) What a genuine expression of brotherly love!</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong></span> It is no different among God’s people today. When we learn that our brothers​—in another land or in our own area—​are in need, we willingly reach out to help them. Branch Committees quickly organize the formation of Disaster Relief Committees to look after our brothers who may be affected by natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. All such relief efforts demonstrate the genuineness of our brotherhood.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="46-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:17-62:3:17" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong></span> As true Christians, we take to heart the meaning of the vision that Peter received on the rooftop in Joppa back in the first century. We worship an impartial God. It is his will that we bear thorough witness about his Kingdom, which involves preaching to others regardless of their race, national origin, or social standing. Let us, then, be determined to give all who will listen an opportunity to respond to the good news.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:11-45:10:13" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Rom. 10:11-13</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc">Administrative and military headquarters for the Roman province of Judea were located in Caesarea. The troops under the governor’s command consisted of 500 to 1,000 cavalry and five cohorts, or groups, of infantry. A cohort in full strength consisted of about 600 soldiers. These troops were usually recruited from among Roman subjects rather than citizens. Most served in Caesarea, but small garrisons were scattered throughout Judea. One cohort was permanently based in the Tower of Antonia in Jerusalem in order to police the Temple Mount and the city. The Roman presence in that city would be reinforced during Jewish festivals to deal with possible disturbances.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc">A centurion was in command of about 100 soldiers. The Greek text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:1-44:10:1" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Acts 10:1</a> says that Cornelius was a centurion of the so-called Italian unit, probably based in Caesarea. This unit may have been the Second Italian Cohort of Roman Citizen Volunteers.<span data-fnid="6" class="fn">f<span id="footnotesource6" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="6"></span></span> Centurions had considerable social and military status, as well as wealth. Their pay was perhaps 16 times that of regular soldiers.</p>

Tanners were considered unfit to appear at the temple, and their place of business had to be no less than 50 cubits, or somewhat over 70 feet (20 m), from a town. This, in part, may explain why Simon’s house was “by the sea.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:6-44:10:6" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Acts 10:6</a>.</p></div>
