<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THEY zealously bore witness. Their hearts impelled them to accept the help and guidance of the holy spirit. Persecution did not still their lips. And the rich blessing of God was upon them. All of this was true of the early Christians, just as it is true of Jehovah’s Witnesses today.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">2, 3. What is especially noteworthy about the book of Acts?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Surely you have been encouraged by the faith-strengthening accounts found in the action-packed Bible book Acts of Apostles! It is unique, for it is the only divinely inspired history of early Christianity.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The book of Acts names 95 individuals from 32 lands, 54 cities, and 9 islands. It is a thrilling story about people​—common folk, haughty religionists, vain politicians, rabid persecutors. But most of all, it is about your first-century brothers and sisters, who not only met the usual challenges of life but also preached the good news with zeal.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 4. Why do we enjoy a special bond with such individuals as the apostle Paul, Tabitha, and other faithful witnesses of old?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Almost 2,000 years now separate us from the activities of the zealous apostles Peter and Paul, the beloved physician Luke, generous Barnabas, courageous Stephen, kindhearted Tabitha, hospitable Lydia, and so many other faithful witnesses. Yet, we enjoy a special bond with them. Why? Because we have the same disciple-making commission.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">6, 7. In performing our ministry, what advantage do we have over our first-century fellow believers?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Your fellow believers of the first century did not have the entire Bible for use in their work of bearing witness. Matthew’s Gospel was not available until at least 41 C.E. Some of Paul’s letters were written before Acts was completed, in about 61 C.E. But the early Christians had neither personal copies of the complete Holy Scriptures nor a variety of publications to leave with interested people. Before becoming Jesus’ disciples, Jewish Christians had heard the Hebrew Scriptures read in the synagogue. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:14-47:3:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:14-16</a>) But even they needed to be diligent students, since they probably had to quote texts from memory.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Today, most of us have a personal copy of the Bible and an abundance of Bible literature.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> When Jesus commissioned his disciples to be witnesses, he told them: “You will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you.” Under the direction of God’s spirit, or active force, Jesus’ followers would ultimately serve as witnesses in all the earth. By holy spirit, Peter and Paul effected cures, expelled demons, even raised the dead! However, the power received through holy spirit had a more important purpose. It enabled the apostles and other disciples to impart accurate knowledge that means everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., Jesus’ disciples spoke “in different languages, just as the <em>spirit</em> enabled them to speak.” They thus bore witness regarding “the magnificent things of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:11-44:2:11" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 11</a>) We do not miraculously speak in different languages today. With the help of God’s spirit, however, the faithful slave is producing Bible literature in many languages. For example, millions of copies of <em>The Watchtower</em> and <em>Awake!</em> are printed every month, and our website, jw.org, offers Bible-based publications and videos in well over 1,000 languages. All of this enables us to declare “the magnificent things of God” to people of all nations, tribes, and tongues.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Translation work is being done by thousands of Christian volunteers in over 150 countries and lands.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12. How were Paul and other Christians able to do the work of bearing witness?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> When Paul bore witness to Jews and Gentiles at Antioch in Pisidia, “those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a>) As Luke concludes the book of Acts, Paul is “preaching the kingdom of God . . . with the greatest freeness of speech, without hindrance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:31-44:28:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 28:31</a>) Where is the apostle witnessing?

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> When Jesus’ early disciples experienced persecution, they petitioned Jehovah for boldness.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:18-44:4:31" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 4:18-31</a>) We too pray for wisdom and strength to keep on witnessing despite persecution. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jas. 1:2-8</a>) Because we are blessed by God and helped by his spirit, we press on in Kingdom service.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">14, 15. (a) What happened as a result of “the tribulation that arose over Stephen”? (b) In our time, how did many people in Siberia come to learn the truth?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Stephen gave a bold witness before he met his death at enemy hands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:5-44:6:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 6:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:54-44:7:60" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:54-60</a>) In the “great persecution” that arose at that time, all the disciples except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. But that did not stop the work of bearing witness. Philip went to Samaria “to preach the Christ” and did so with excellent results. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 8:1-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:15" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 14, 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:25-44:8:25" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 25</a>) Moreover, we are told: “Those who had been scattered by the tribulation that arose over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, but they spoke the word only to the Jews. However, some of the men among them from Cyprus and Cyrene came to Antioch and began talking to the Greek-speaking people, declaring the good news of the Lord Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:19-44:11:20" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 11:19, 20</a>) At that time, persecution spread the Kingdom message.</p>

Especially in the 1950’s, thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses were exiled to Siberia. Because they were scattered in various settlements, the good news was constantly spreading in that vast land. In no way could so many Witnesses have found the money needed to travel perhaps as much as 6,000 miles (10,000 km) to proclaim the good news! However, the government itself sent them across the country. “As it turned out,” said one brother, “the authorities themselves enabled thousands of sincere people in Siberia to come to know the truth.”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16, 17. The book of Acts gives us what evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on the work of bearing witness?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s blessing was unquestionably upon the early Christians.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> In Syrian Antioch, both Jews and Greek-speaking people heard the truth from courageous witnesses. “Furthermore,” says the account, “the hand of Jehovah was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:21-44:11:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 11:21</a>) Regarding further progress in that city, we read: “The word of Jehovah went on growing and spreading.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:24-44:12:24" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 12:24</a>) And with the witnessing work of Paul and others in full swing among Gentiles, “in a mighty way, the word of Jehovah kept growing and prevailing.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:20-44:19:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 19:20</a>.</p>

In May 1942 the Gestapo went to the home of his wife, Elsa, took away their little girl, and arrested Elsa. She was sent to various camps. “My years in German concentration camps taught me an outstanding lesson,” said Sister Abt. “It is, how greatly Jehovah’s spirit can strengthen you when you are under extreme trial! Before I was arrested, I had read a sister’s letter that said that under severe trial Jehovah’s spirit causes a calmness to come over you. I thought that she must have been exaggerating a bit. But when I went through trials myself, I knew that what she had said was true. It really happens that way. It’s hard to imagine it, if you have not experienced it. Yet it really happened to me.”</p>
