<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Not many days earlier, Paul and Barnabas were thrown out of the Roman city of Pisidian Antioch after Jewish opposers stirred up trouble for them. Instead of becoming discouraged, however, the two men “shook the dust off their feet” against the city’s unresponsive inhabitants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:50-44:13:52" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 13:50-52;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:14-40:10:14" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Matt. 10:14</a>) Paul and Barnabas peacefully departed and left those resisters to the consequences that would come from God.

Trekking about 100 miles (150 km) southeast, they reached a fertile plateau cupped between the Taurus and Sultan mountain ranges.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Initially, Paul and Barnabas stopped at Iconium, an enclave of Greek culture and one of the principal cities of the Roman province of Galatia.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> This city sheltered an influential Jewish population and a large number of non-Jewish proselytes.

<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div id="p45" data-pid="45" class="boxTtl rule"><h2><strong>ICONIUM​—CITY OF THE PHRYGIANS</strong></h2></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sc">Iconium was located on a high, well-watered, and fertile plateau. The city stood at a crossroads on an important trade route linking Syria with Rome, Greece, and the Roman province of Asia.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sc">The local religion in Iconium was worship of the Phrygian fertility goddess Cybele, which included elements adopted from Greek worship during the Hellenistic period. The city came under Roman influence in 65 B.C.E., and in the first century C.E., it was a large and prosperous center of trade and agriculture. Although Iconium was home to an influential Jewish population, the city seems to have retained its Hellenistic character. The Acts account, in fact, refers to resident Jews and to “Greeks.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:1-44:14:1" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Acts 14:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc">Iconium lay on the border between the Galatian regions of Lycaonia and Phrygia. Certain ancient writers, including Cicero and Strabo, called Iconium a city of Lycaonia, and from a geographic standpoint, the city did belong to that region. The Acts account, however, distinguishes Iconium from Lycaonia, where “the Lycaonian language” was spoken. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:1-44:14:6" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Acts 14:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:11-44:14:11" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 11</a>) For this reason, critics argued that the book of Acts was inaccurate. In 1910, though, archaeologists found inscriptions in the city indicating that Phrygian was indeed the language used in Iconium for two centuries following the visit of Paul and Barnabas. Hence, the writer of Acts was correct in distinguishing Iconium from the cities of Lycaonia.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. Why were Paul and Barnabas effective teachers, and how can we imitate them?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Why was the manner in which Paul and Barnabas spoke so effective? Paul was a storehouse of Scriptural wisdom. He masterfully linked references to history, prophecy, and the Mosaic Law in order to prove that Jesus was the promised Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:15-44:13:31" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 13:15-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:22-44:26:23" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 26:22, 23</a>) Barnabas radiated concern for people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:36-44:4:37" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 4:36, 37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:27-44:9:27" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 9:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:23-44:11:24" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 11:23, 24</a>) Neither man relied on his own understanding but spoke “by the authority of Jehovah.” How can you imitate those missionaries in your preaching activity? By doing the following: Become thoroughly familiar with God’s Word. Select Scriptural references that are most likely to appeal to your listeners. Look for practical ways to comfort those to whom you preach. And always base your teaching on the authority of Jehovah’s Word, not on your own wisdom.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7. (a) The good news produces what effects? (b) If your family is divided because of your obedience to the good news, what should you remember?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> However, not all in Iconium were happy to hear what Paul and Barnabas had to say. “Jews who did not believe,” continued Luke, “stirred up and wrongly influenced the people of the nations against the brothers.” Paul and Barnabas discerned the need to stay and defend the good news, and they “spent considerable time speaking with boldness.” As a result, “the multitude of the city was divided; some were for the Jews but others for the apostles.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:2-44:14:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 14:2-4</a>) Today, the good news produces similar effects. For some it is a force for unity; for others, a cause for division. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:34-40:10:36" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 10:34-36</a>) If your family is divided because you are obedient to the good news, remember that opposition is often a reaction to unfounded rumor or outright slander. Your fine conduct could become the antidote to such poison and may eventually soften the hearts of those who oppose you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:2" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3:1, 2</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:5-44:14:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 14:5-7</a>) Kingdom proclaimers use similar discretion today. When faced with verbal attacks, we speak with boldness.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Paul and Barnabas headed for Lystra, a Roman colony about 20 miles (30 km) to the southwest of Iconium. Lystra maintained strong ties with Pisidian Antioch but, unlike that city, did not have a prominent Jewish community. While the inhabitants likely spoke Greek, their mother tongue was Lycaonian. Possibly because the city contained no synagogue, Paul and Barnabas began preaching in a public area. While in Jerusalem, Peter had healed a man born disabled. In Lystra, Paul healed a man who was lame from birth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:8-44:14:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 14:8-10</a>) Because of the miracle Peter had performed, a great crowd had become believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:1-44:3:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 3:1-10</a>) The miracle Paul performed led to a drastically different outcome.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> As described at the outset of this chapter, when the lame man leaped to his feet, the pagan crowd in Lystra immediately drew the wrong conclusion. They referred to Barnabas as Zeus, the chief of the gods, and to Paul as Hermes, the son of Zeus and spokesman for the gods. (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009056/50-53">Lystra and the Cult of Zeus and Hermes</a>.”) Barnabas and Paul, however, were determined to make the crowd understand that they spoke and acted not by the authority of pagan <span id="page97" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="97" data-before-text="97"></span>gods but by the authority of Jehovah, the one true God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:11-44:14:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 14:11-14</a>.</p>
<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div id="p50" data-pid="50" class="boxTtl rule"><h2><strong>LYSTRA AND THE CULT OF ZEUS AND HERMES</strong></h2></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc">Lystra was located in a secluded valley off the main highways. Caesar Augustus designated the city a Roman colony, naming it Julia Felix Gemina Lustra. Its garrison was to defend the province of Galatia from local mountain tribes. The city was thus administered according to traditional Roman civic organization, with its officials bearing Latin titles. Even so, Lystra retained much of its local character. It remained more Lycaonian than Roman, and indeed, the Lystran protagonists in the Acts account spoke the Lycaonian language.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sc">Among the archaeological finds in the vicinity of ancient Lystra are inscriptions referring to “priests of Zeus” and a statue of the god Hermes. An altar dedicated to Zeus and Hermes has also been discovered in that area.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">A legend recorded by the Roman poet Ovid (43 B.C.E. to 17 C.E.) provides further background for the Acts account. According to Ovid, Jupiter and Mercury, the Roman counterparts of the Greek gods Zeus and Hermes, visited the hill country of Phrygia disguised as mortal men. They sought hospitality in a thousand homes, but everyone turned them away. Only an elderly couple, named Philemon and Baucis, welcomed them into their humble cottage. As a result, Zeus and Hermes transformed that home into a temple of marble and gold, made the elderly couple its priest and priestess, and destroyed the homes of those who had refused them lodging. “If the people of Lystra remembered such a legend when they saw Paul and Barnabas heal the lame man,” says <em>The Book of Acts in Its Graeco-Roman Setting,</em> “it is not surprising that they would want to welcome them with sacrifices.”</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">11-13. (a) What did Paul and Barnabas say to the inhabitants of Lystra? (b) What is one lesson that we can learn from the statements made by Paul and Barnabas?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Despite the dramatic circumstances, Paul and Barnabas still sought to reach the hearts of their audience in the best way. With this incident, Luke recorded an effective way to preach the good news to pagans. Note how Paul and Barnabas appealed to their listeners: “Men, why are you doing these things? We too are humans having the same infirmities as you have. And we are declaring the good news to you, for you to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them. In past generations he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways, although he did not leave himself without witness in that he did good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:15-44:14:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 14:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> What lessons can we learn from these thought-provoking words? First, Paul and Barnabas did not consider themselves superior to their audience. They did not pretend to be something that they were not. Instead, they humbly admitted to having the same weaknesses as their pagan listeners. True, Paul and Barnabas had received the holy spirit and had been freed from false teachings. They had also been blessed with the hope of ruling with Christ. But they realized that the inhabitants of Lystra could receive these very same gifts by obeying Christ.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span id="page98" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="98" data-before-text="98"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> What is our attitude toward those to whom we preach? Do we view them as our equals? As we help others learn truths from God’s Word, do we, like Paul and Barnabas, avoid seeking adulation? Charles Taze Russell, an outstanding teacher who took the lead in the preaching work in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, set an example in this regard. He wrote: “We want no homage, no reverence, for ourselves or our writings; nor do we wish to be called Reverend or Rabbi.” Brother Russell’s humble attitude reflected that of Paul and Barnabas. Likewise, our purpose in preaching is not to bring glory to ourselves but to help people to turn to “the living God.”</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">14-16. What second and third lessons can we learn from what Paul and Barnabas said to the inhabitants of Lystra?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Consider a second lesson we can learn from this speech. Paul and Barnabas were adaptable. Unlike the Jews and proselytes in Iconium, the inhabitants of Lystra had little or no knowledge of the Scriptures or of God’s dealings with the nation of Israel. Even so, those listening to Paul and Barnabas were part of an agricultural community. Lystra was blessed with a mild climate and fertile fields. Those people could see ample evidence of the Creator’s qualities as revealed in such things as fruitful seasons, and the missionaries used this common ground in their appeal to reason.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:19-45:1:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 1:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Can we likewise be adaptable? Although a farmer may plant the same type of seed in a number of his fields, he has to vary the methods he uses to prepare the soil. Some ground may already be soft and ready to accept the seed. Other soil may need more preparation. Similarly, the seed we plant is always the same​—the Kingdom message found in God’s Word. However, if we are like Paul and Barnabas, we will try to discern the circumstances and religious background of the people to whom we preach. Then we will allow this knowledge to influence the way we present the Kingdom message.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:11-42:8:11" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 8:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:15-42:8:15" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> We can learn a third lesson from the account involving Paul, Barnabas, and the inhabitants of Lystra. Despite our best efforts, the seed we plant is sometimes snatched away or falls on rocky soil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:18-40:13:21" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 13:18-21</a>) If that happens, do not despair. As Paul later reminded the disciples in Rome, “each of us [including each individual with whom we discuss God’s Word] will render an account for himself to God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rom. 14:12</a>.</p>

We can only imagine the discomfort Paul felt during this arduous trip, having been pelted with stones just hours earlier. Still, he and Barnabas persevered, and when they arrived in Derbe, they made “quite a few disciples.” Then, rather than taking the shorter route back to their home base in Syrian Antioch, “they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and [Pisidian] Antioch.” For what purpose? To strengthen “the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:20-44:14:22" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 14:20-22</a>) What an example those two men set!

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> In addition to strengthening the disciples by their words and example, Paul and Barnabas appointed “elders for them in each congregation.” Although “sent out by the holy spirit” on this missionary journey, Paul and Barnabas still prayed and fasted when “they entrusted them [the elders] to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:1-44:13:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 13:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:23-44:14:23" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 14:23</a>) A similar pattern is followed today.

Instead, the brother’s speech, conduct, and reputation give evidence of the degree to which holy spirit operates in his life.
