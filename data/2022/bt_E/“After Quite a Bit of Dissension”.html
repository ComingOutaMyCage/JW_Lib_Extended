But instead of bringing joy to all, this development forces into prominence the ongoing debate about circumcision.

The issue causes dissension that becomes so serious that it threatens to split the Christian congregation into factions. How will this matter be resolved?</p>

For one thing, male circumcision had been instituted by Jehovah himself, and it was a sign of a special relationship with him. Predating the Law covenant but later becoming part of it, circumcision began with Abraham and his household.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:12:2-3:12:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 12:2, 3</a>) Under the Mosaic Law, even foreigners had to be circumcised before they could enjoy certain privileges, such as eating the Passover meal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:43-2:12:44" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 12:43, 44,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:48-2:12:49" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 48, 49</a>) Indeed, in the Jewish mind, for a man to be uncircumcised was to be unclean, contemptible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:1-23:52:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 52:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Thus, it required faith and humility on the part of Jewish believers to adjust to revealed truth. The Law covenant had been replaced by the new covenant, so birth as a Jew no longer automatically made one a member of God’s people. And for Jewish Christians who lived in Jewish communities​—as did the believers in Judea—​it took courage to confess Christ and to accept as fellow believers Gentiles who had not been circumcised.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jer. 31:31-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Luke 22:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. What truths had “men . . . from Judea” failed to grasp?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Of course, God’s standards had not changed. Reflecting this truth, the new covenant incorporated the <em>spirit</em> of the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:36-40:22:40" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 22:36-40</a>) In regard to circumcision, for example, Paul later wrote: “He is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit, and not by a written code.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:29-45:2:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 2:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:16-5:10:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deut. 10:16</a>) The “men . . . from Judea” had not grasped these truths but asserted that God had never revoked the law of circumcision. Would they listen to reason?</p>
<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div id="p55" data-pid="55" class="boxTtl rule"><h2><strong>THE TEACHINGS OF THE JUDAIZERS</strong></h2></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc">Even after the first-century governing body settled the circumcision issue, certain individuals who claimed to be Christians stubbornly kept the question alive. The apostle Paul called them “false brothers” who wanted “to distort the good news about the Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:7-48:1:7" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Gal. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:4-48:2:4" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:10-56:1:10" data-bid="45-3" class="b"> Titus 1:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">The Judaizers’ objective was apparently to appease the Jews, to keep them from opposing Christianity so violently. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:12-48:6:13" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Gal. 6:12, 13</a>) The Judaizers argued that righteousness was established by works of the Mosaic Law in such matters as diet, circumcision, and Jewish festivals.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:16-51:2:16" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Col. 2:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">Understandably, those who held to these views felt uncomfortable in the presence of Gentile believers. Sadly, such unwholesome feelings were even manifest among a number of reputable Christians of Jewish background. For example, when representatives from the Jerusalem congregation visited Antioch, they kept separate from their Gentile brothers. Even Peter, who until then had freely socialized with the Gentiles, withdrew​—not even eating with them. Yes, he went against the very principles he had earlier defended. As a result, Peter received strong counsel from Paul.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:11-48:2:14" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Gal. 2:11-14</a>.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">9, 10. In what way did the brothers in Antioch as well as Paul and Barnabas set a fine example for us today?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> One valuable lesson we learn is that we need to trust God’s organization. Consider: The brothers in Antioch knew that the governing body was made up entirely of Christians of Jewish background. Yet, they trusted that body to settle the question of circumcision in harmony with the Scriptures. Why? The congregation was confident that Jehovah would direct matters by means of his holy spirit and the Head of the Christian congregation, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:22-49:1:23" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Eph. 1:22, 23</a>) When serious issues arise today, let us imitate the fine example of the believers in Antioch by trusting God’s organization and its Governing Body of anointed Christians.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> We are also reminded of the value of humility and patience. Paul and Barnabas had been personally appointed by holy spirit to go to the nations, yet they did not invoke that authority to settle the issue of circumcision then and there in Antioch. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:2-44:13:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 13:2, 3</a>) Moreover, Paul later wrote: “I went up [to Jerusalem] as a result of a revelation”​—indicating divine direction in the matter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:2-48:2:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gal. 2:2</a>) Elders today strive to have the same humble, patient attitude when potentially divisive questions arise. Instead of being contentious, they look to Jehovah by consulting the Scriptures and the instruction and guidance provided by the faithful slave.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:2-50:2:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Phil. 2:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11, 12. Why is it important to wait on Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> In some instances, we may have to wait for Jehovah to shed light on a certain matter.

Why so long? Perhaps God wanted to allow sufficient time for sincere Jews to adjust to such a major change in viewpoint. After all, the termination of the 1,900-year-old covenant of circumcision made with their beloved forefather Abraham was no minor matter!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:12-43:16:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 16:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> What a privilege it is to be instructed and molded by our patient and kind heavenly Father! The results are always good and always to our advantage.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:8-21:7:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:8</a>) If you detect even a hint of such a tendency in yourself, why not meditate prayerfully on the timely principles found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:1-44:15:41" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts chapter 15</a>?<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> The need for patience may arise when we study the Bible with people who find it hard to abandon cherished false beliefs or unscriptural customs.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:7" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6, 7</a>) Also, we do well to make the subject a matter of prayer.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc">As amply demonstrated in the case of the early Christian congregation, the history of true worship is a record of progressive spiritual enlightenment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Dan. 12:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:9-27:12:10" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> 9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:7-44:15:9" data-bid="49-4" class="b"> Acts 15:7-9</a>) Today, too, Jehovah’s people adjust their beliefs to conform to revealed truth; they do not force the Scriptures to fit their views. Impartial observers have recognized this fact. In his book <em>Truth in Translation,</em> Jason David BeDuhn, associate professor of religious studies at Northern Arizona University in the United States, wrote that Jehovah’s Witnesses approach the Bible “with a kind of innocence, and [build] their system of belief and practice from the raw material of the Bible without predetermining what was to be found there.”</p>

On the contrary, we have faith that we are saved through the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus in the same way that they are.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:10-44:15:11" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Acts 15:10, 11</a>) Promoters of circumcision were, in fact, “making a test of God,” or ‘straining his patience,’ as another translation renders it. They were trying to impose on Gentiles a code that the Jews themselves could not fully comply with and that therefore condemned them to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:10-48:3:10" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Gal. 3:10</a>) Instead, Peter’s Jewish listeners should have been thankful for God’s undeserved kindness expressed through Jesus.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21. Barnabas and Paul contributed what to the discussion?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> Evidently, Peter’s words struck home, for “the entire group became silent.” Thereafter, Barnabas and Paul related “the many signs and wonders that God had done through them among the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:12-44:15:12" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Acts 15:12</a>) Now, at last, the apostles and elders were in a position to evaluate all the evidence and make a decision that clearly reflected the will of God on the matter of circumcision.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">22-24. (a) How does the Governing Body today follow the example of the early governing body? (b) How can all elders show respect for theocratic authority?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong></span> Today, too, when the members of the Governing Body meet, they look to God’s Word for direction and pray earnestly for holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:7-40:7:11" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Matt. 7:7-11</a>) To that end, each member of the Governing Body receives an agenda ahead of time so that he can give the items prayerful thought. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:28-20:15:28" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Prov. 15:28</a>) At the meeting, these anointed brothers freely <span id="page107" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="107" data-before-text="107"></span>and respectfully express themselves. The Bible is used frequently during the discussions.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong></span> Congregation elders should imitate that example. And if after consideration at an elders’ meeting a serious matter remains unresolved, the body may consult the local branch office or its appointed representatives, such as circuit overseers. The branch, in turn, may write to the Governing Body if necessary.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong></span> Yes, Jehovah blesses those who respect the theocratic arrangement and who display humility, loyalty, and patience. As we shall see in the following chapter, the God-given rewards for doing so are genuine peace, spiritual prosperity, and Christian unity.</p>
