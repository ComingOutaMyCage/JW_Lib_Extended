<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE judges of the Sanhedrin are simmering with rage! The apostles of Jesus are standing trial before this high court. The reason? Joseph Caiaphas, the high priest and president of the Sanhedrin, sternly addresses them: “We strictly ordered you not to keep teaching on the basis of this name.” The angry president cannot bring himself even to utter the name of Jesus. Yet, Caiaphas continues, “you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you are determined to bring the blood of this man upon us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:28-44:5:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:28</a>) The message is clear: Stop preaching​—or else!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> How will the apostles respond? Their commission to preach came from Jesus, whose authority was divinely bestowed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>) Will the apostles cave in to fear of man and be silenced? Or will they have the courage to stand firm and continue preaching? The issue really boils down to this: Will they obey God or man? Without hesitation, the apostle Peter speaks for all the apostles. His words are unequivocal and bold.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> As true Christians, we are keenly interested in how the apostles responded to the threats of the Sanhedrin.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">Although Judea was a province of the Roman Empire, Rome permitted the Jews to observe their own traditions and for the most part to govern themselves. Minor crimes and civil cases were handled by local courts, but questions that those courts could not decide were referred to the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. This body functioned as the supreme court of the Jewish people and as a national administrative council. It also had the final word on the interpretation of Jewish law, and its authority was respected by Jews everywhere.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc">The Sanhedrin met in its decision chamber, which appears to have been located either in the temple precincts or in its immediate vicinity. The council was made up of 71 members​—the high priest, who was the president; other priestly nobles, including Sadducees; lay aristocrats; and learned scribes. The decisions of the court were final.</p>

The apostles performed great signs, such as healing the sick and expelling demons. They did so “in Solomon’s Colonnade,” a covered portico on the east side of the temple, where many Jews would gather. Why, even Peter’s shadow apparently effected cures! Many who were healed physically responded to words of spiritual healing. As a result, “believers in the Lord kept on being added, great numbers both of men and of women.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:12-44:5:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 5:12-15</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Caiaphas and the other judges of the Sanhedrin were now ready to deal with the apostles. Unaware of what had happened at the jail, the court dispatched officers to fetch the prisoners. Imagine the officers’ surprise when they discovered that the prisoners were missing, although the jail was locked and secure and “the guards were standing at the doors.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:23-44:5:23" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 5:23</a>) The captain of the temple soon learned that the apostles were back in the temple, bearing witness about Jesus Christ​—the very work for which they had been thrown in jail! The captain and his officers quickly went to the temple to gather up the prisoners and escort them to the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> As described at the outset of this chapter, the furious religious leaders made it clear that the apostles were to stop preaching. The apostles’ response?

Human rulers forfeit their right to obedience in situations where they prohibit what God requires or require what God prohibits. So in our day, if “the superior authorities” ban our witnessing work, we cannot stop carrying out our God-given assignment to preach the good news.

Gamaliel’s reasoning was persuasive: “Do not meddle with these men, but let them alone. For if this scheme or this work is from men, it will be overthrown; but if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them.

<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div id="p56" data-pid="56" class="boxTtl rule"><h2><strong>PREACHING “FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE”</strong></h2></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">Despite the Sanhedrin’s ban on their preaching activity, the disciples continued preaching and teaching “every day in the temple and <em>from house to house.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Acts 5:42</a>) Exactly what does “from house to house” mean?</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">In the original Greek, the phrase <em>katʼ oiʹkon</em> literally means “according to house.” Several translators state that the word <em>ka·taʹ</em> is to be understood in a “distributive” sense, that is, the disciples’ preaching was distributed from one house to another. A similar use of <em>ka·taʹ</em> occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:1-42:8:1" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Luke 8:1</a>, where Jesus is said to have preached “from city to city and from village to village.”</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">The plural form, <em>katʼ oiʹkous,</em> is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Acts 20:20</a>. The apostle Paul told Christian overseers: “I did not hold back from . . . teaching you publicly and from house to house.” That Paul here was not simply talking about teaching in the elders’ homes, as some suggest, is indicated in the next verse: “But I thoroughly bore witness both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:21-44:20:21" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Acts 20:21</a>) Fellow believers had already repented and put faith in Jesus. So the preaching and teaching from house to house clearly had to do with bearing witness to unbelievers.</p>

Definitely not! Among the men chosen was Stephen, who would prove himself to be a bold and powerful witness-bearer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:8-44:6:10" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Acts 6:8-10</a>) Philip too was one of the seven, and he is called “the evangelizer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:8-44:21:8" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 21:8</a>) Evidently, then, the seven men continued to be zealous Kingdom preachers.</p>

Ministerial servants care for many duties that do not directly involve shepherding or teaching. All such qualified men must balance congregational and organizational responsibilities with the God-assigned obligation to preach the good news of the Kingdom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:16-46:9:16" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:16</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc">The Gamaliel of Acts is generally identified as Gamaliel the Elder, the grandson of Hillel, who was founder of the more liberal of the two schools of Pharisaism. Gamaliel occupied a leading position in the Sanhedrin and was so highly esteemed among the rabbis that he was the first to be given the honorific title “Rabban.” The Mishnah says: “When Rabban Gamaliel the Elder died, the glory of the Law ceased and purity and abstinence died.” He is credited with various humane enactments. “Of particular importance,” says the <em>Encyclopaedia Judaica,</em> “is his decision permitting a woman to remarry on the evidence of a single witness to the death of her husband.” He is also said to have enacted laws protecting wives against unprincipled husbands and widows against unprincipled children and to have argued that poor Gentiles should have the same gleaning rights as poor Jews.</p>
