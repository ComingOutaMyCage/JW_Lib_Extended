SECTION 8 • ACTS 21:18–28:31
“Preaching the Kingdom of God . . . Without Hindrance”

ACTS 28:31

Through it all, the apostle continues bearing witness about God’s Kingdom. As you consider the exciting conclusion to the book of Acts, ask yourself, ‘How can I imitate this bold and zealous evangelizer?’
