<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE streets of Ephesus resound with shouts, cries, and the thunder of crowds running. A mob has formed, and a full-blown riot is underway! Two of the apostle Paul’s traveling companions are seized and dragged along. The wide, colonnaded street where the shops are located empties quickly as the rabid crowd swells and storms into the city’s huge amphitheater, which could accommodate 25,000 spectators. Most of the people do not even know what has caused the uproar, but they have a faint idea that their temple and their beloved goddess Artemis are being threatened. So they begin to chant frantically: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:34-44:19:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Once again, we see Satan trying to use mob violence to stop the spread of the good news of God’s Kingdom. Of course, the threat of violence is not Satan’s only tactic. In this chapter, we will discuss a number of Satan’s schemes to undermine the work and unity of those first-century Christians. More important, we will see that all his tactics failed, for “in a mighty way, the word of Jehovah kept growing and prevailing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:20-44:19:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 19:20</a>) Why did those Christians prove victorious? For the same reasons that we do today. Of course, the victory is Jehovah’s, not ours. However, like the first-century Christians, we must do our part. With the aid of Jehovah’s spirit, we can acquire qualities that will help to ensure the success of our ministry. Let us first consider the example of Apollos.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> While Paul was on his way to Ephesus during his third missionary tour, a Jew named Apollos arrived in the city. He was from the famed city of Alexandria, Egypt. Apollos had some outstanding qualities. He <span id="page159" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="159" data-before-text="159"></span>spoke very well. In addition to his eloquence, “he was . . . well-versed in the Scriptures.” Furthermore, he was “aglow with the spirit.” Full of zeal, Apollos spoke boldly before Jewish audiences in the synagogue.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:24-44:18:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 18:24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Aquila and Priscilla heard Apollos speak. No doubt they were thrilled to hear him “teaching accurately the things about Jesus.” What he said about Jesus was correct. However, before long that Christian couple detected an important gap in Apollos’ knowledge. He was “acquainted only with the baptism of John.” This humble couple, tentmakers by trade, were not intimidated by the eloquence or education of Apollos. Rather, “they took him into their company and explained the way of God more accurately to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:25-44:18:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 18:25, 26</a>) And how did this well-spoken, learned man respond? Evidently, he showed one of the most important qualities that a Christian can cultivate​—humility.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">5, 6. What enabled Apollos to become more useful to Jehovah, and what may we learn from Apollos’ example?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Because Apollos accepted the assistance of Aquila and Priscilla, he became a more effective servant of Jehovah. He traveled on to Achaia, where he “greatly helped” the believers. His preaching also proved effective against those Jews in that region who insisted that Jesus was not the foretold Messiah. Luke reports: “With great intensity he thoroughly proved the Jews to be wrong, showing them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:27-44:18:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 18:27, 28</a>) What a blessing Apollos became! In effect, he was another reason why “the word of Jehovah” went on prevailing. What can we learn from Apollos’ example?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Cultivating humility is absolutely essential for Christians. Each of us is blessed with various gifts​—whether these have to do with natural abilities, experience, or knowledge that we have acquired. However, our humility must exceed our gifts. Otherwise, our assets may become liabilities. We may become fertile ground for the growth of that poisonous weed haughtiness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:7-46:4:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:6-59:4:6" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Jas. 4:6</a>) If we are truly humble, we will endeavor to see others as superior to us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 2:3</a>) We will neither resent correction nor resist being taught by others. We will certainly not cling proudly to our own ideas when we learn that these are out of harmony with the present leadings of the holy spirit. As long as we remain humble, we are useful to Jehovah and his Son.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:51-42:1:52" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 1:51, 52</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. How did Paul and Apollos set an example of humility?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Humility also defuses rivalry. Can you imagine how eager Satan was to create divisions among those early Christians? How delighted he would have been if two such dynamic personalities as Apollos and the apostle Paul had allowed themselves to become rivals, perhaps <span id="page160" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="160" data-before-text="160"></span>jealously vying for influence among the congregations! It would have been easy for them to do so. In Corinth, some Christians began saying, “I belong to Paul,” while others said, “But I to Apollos.” Did Paul and Apollos encourage such divisive sentiments? No! And Paul humbly acknowledged Apollos’ contribution to the work, granting him privileges of service. For his part, Apollos followed Paul’s direction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:6" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:12-56:3:13" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Titus 3:12, 13</a>) What a fine example of humble cooperation for us today!</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Paul had promised to return to Ephesus, and he kept his word.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:20-44:18:21" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 18:20, 21</a>) Note, though, <em>how</em> he returned. We last saw him in Antioch, Syria. To reach Ephesus, he could have made the short trip to Seleucia, boarded a ship, and sailed directly to his destination. Instead, he traveled “through the inland regions.” By one estimate, Paul’s journey as traced out in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:23-44:18:23" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 18:23</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:1-44:19:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">19:1</a> encompassed about a thousand miles (1,600 km)! Why did Paul choose such an arduous route? Because he had as his aim, “strengthening all the disciples.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:23-44:18:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 18:23</a>) His third missionary journey, like the previous two, would demand much of him, but he considered it all worthwhile. Circuit overseers and their wives today display a like spirit. Do we not appreciate their self-sacrificing love?</p>
<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div id="p51" data-pid="51" class="boxTtl rule"><h2><strong>EPHESUS​—CAPITAL OF ASIA</strong></h2></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sc">Ephesus was the largest city in western Asia Minor. In the apostle Paul’s day, its population probably exceeded 250,000. As the capital of the Roman province of Asia, it proudly bore the title “First and Greatest Metropolis of Asia.”</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">Ephesus derived great wealth from commerce and religion. Located close to the mouth of a navigable river, its seaport stood at the intersection of trade routes. Ephesus was home not only to the famous temple of Artemis but also to the shrines and temples of numerous other Greco-Roman, Egyptian, and Anatolian deities.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc">The temple of Artemis, lauded as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, measured approximately 350 feet (105 m) by 160 feet (50 m). It contained some 100 marble pillars, each about 6 feet (1.8 m) in diameter at the base and almost 55 feet (17 m) high. The temple was considered sacrosanct throughout the ancient Mediterranean area, and huge sums of money were entrusted to the safekeeping of Artemis; so the temple also became the most important banking center in Asia.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sc">Other important buildings in Ephesus were a stadium for athletic contests and possibly even gladiatorial combat, a theater, civic and commercial squares, and colonnades housing shops.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc">The Greek geographer Strabo reports that the harbor of Ephesus suffered from silting. In time, the city therefore ceased to function as a port and was abandoned. Since no modern city stands on the same site, present-day visitors to the extensive ruins of Ephesus can, in effect, step back into the ancient world.</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. Why did a group of disciples need to be rebaptized, and what lesson may we learn from their course?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> On his arrival at Ephesus, Paul found a group of about a dozen disciples of John the Baptizer. They had been baptized under an arrangement that was no longer valid. Furthermore, they seemed to know little or nothing about the holy spirit. Paul brought them up-to-date, and like Apollos, they proved to be humble and eager to learn. After being baptized in the name of Jesus, they received holy spirit and some miraculous gifts. Clearly, then, keeping up with Jehovah’s advancing theocratic organization brings blessings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:1-44:19:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 19:1-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10. Why did Paul move from the synagogue to an auditorium, setting what example for us in our ministry?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Another example of progress soon followed. Paul preached boldly in the synagogue for three months. Although he was “reasoning persuasively about the Kingdom of God,” some hardened themselves and became real opposers. Rather than wasting time with those who were “speaking injuriously about The Way,” Paul made arrangements <span id="page161" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="161" data-before-text="161"></span>to speak in a school auditorium. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:8-44:19:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 19:8, 9</a>) Those who wanted to make spiritual progress needed to make a move from the synagogue to the auditorium. Like Paul, we may withdraw from some conversations when we recognize that the householder is unwilling to listen or only wants to argue. There are still plenty of sheeplike people who need to hear our encouraging message!</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">11, 12. (a) How did Paul set an example in being industrious and adaptable? (b) How have Jehovah’s Witnesses endeavored to be industrious and adaptable in their public ministry?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Paul may have spoken in that school auditorium daily from about 11:00 a.m. until about 4:00 p.m. (See study note on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:9-44:19:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 19:9</a>, <em>nwtsty.</em>) Those were likely the quietest but hottest hours of the day when many stopped their work to eat and rest.

Paul was industrious and adaptable. He adjusted his schedule so that his ministry met the needs of the people in that community. The result? “All those living in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:10-44:19:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 19:10</a>) What a thorough witness he gave!</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Some “Jews who traveled around casting out demons” sought to duplicate Paul’s miracles. Certain ones of those Jews tried to expel demons by invoking the names of Jesus and Paul. Luke gives the example of the seven sons of Sceva​—members of a priestly family—​who sought to do this. The demon said to them: “I know Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul; but who are you?” The possessed man then attacked those charlatans, leaping on them like a wild beast, sending them scurrying off, wounded and naked.

He got the attention of his fellow craftsmen by first reminding them that their prosperity came from selling idols. He went on to suggest that the message Paul preached was bad for business, since the Christians did not worship idols. Then he appealed to the civic pride and nationalism of his audience, warning them that their goddess Artemis and their world-famous temple to her were in danger of being “viewed as nothing.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:24-44:19:27" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 19:24-27</a>.</p>

A capable man with presence of mind, this official assured the mob that their temple and goddess were in no danger from these Christians, that Paul and his companions had committed no crime against the temple of Artemis, and that there was a due process in place for raising such issues. Perhaps most tellingly, he reminded the mob that they were in danger of incurring the wrath of Rome for this unlawful and unruly gathering. With that, he dismissed the crowd.

In fact, the apostle John foresaw in a vision that during these last days, the stable elements of this world, pictured by the earth, would swallow up a veritable flood of satanic persecution against Jesus’ followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:15-66:12:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rev. 12:15, 16</a>) That has proved true.

Of course, our own conduct may play a role in such victories. Paul’s conduct had apparently won him the friendly respect of some governmental officials in Ephesus, so they were eager to see him safe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:31-44:19:31" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Acts 19:31</a>) May our honest and respectful conduct make a favorable impression on those we meet as well. We never know how far-reaching the effects may be.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">20. (a) How do you feel about the way Jehovah’s word prevailed in the first century and is prevailing today? (b) What is your resolve regarding Jehovah’s victories in our time?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Is it not thrilling to contemplate how “the word of Jehovah kept growing and prevailing” in the first century? It is equally thrilling to see how Jehovah has been behind similar victories in our time. Would you like to have the privilege of playing a part, however small, in such victories? Then learn from the examples we have considered. Stay humble, keep up with Jehovah’s progressive organization, keep working hard, repudiate spiritism, and do your utmost to give a good witness through your honest and respectful conduct.</p>
