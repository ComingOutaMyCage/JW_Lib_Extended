The Jews had no dealings with Samaritans, many even showing disdain for them. In contrast, the Samaritans found that the message of the good news ignored class distinctions, and thus it differed greatly from the narrow-minded thinking of the Pharisees. By zealously and impartially witnessing to the Samaritans, Philip showed that he was not tainted by the prejudice of those who looked down on them. It is hardly surprising, then, that crowds of Samaritans listened to Philip “with one accord.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:6-44:8:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 8:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">5-7. Give examples of how the dispersion of Christians has led to the spread of the good news.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Today, as in the first century, persecution of God’s people has not silenced their preaching. Time and again, forcing Christians to move from one place to another​—either prison or another land—​has only helped to introduce the Kingdom message to people in the new location. For instance, during World War II, Jehovah’s Witnesses were able to give an outstanding witness in Nazi concentration camps. A Jew who <span id="page55" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>encountered the Witnesses there relates: “The fortitude of prisoners who were Jehovah’s Witnesses convinced me that their faith was based on the Scriptures​—and I became a Witness myself.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> In some cases, even persecutors received a witness and responded to it. For example, when a Witness named Franz Desch was transferred to the Gusen concentration camp in Austria, he was able to study the Bible with an SS officer. Imagine their joy when years later the two men were reunited at a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses and <em>both</em> were proclaimers of the good news!</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Something similar happened when persecution caused Christians to flee from one country to another. In the 1970’s, for example, a great witness was given in Mozambique when Malawian Witnesses were forced to flee there. Even when opposition later arose in Mozambique, the preaching work went on. “True, some of us were apprehended and arrested a number of times for our preaching activity,” says Francisco Coana. “Yet, when many responded to the Kingdom message, we were confident that God was helping us, just as he helped first-century Christians.”</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8. How have political and economic changes had an impact on the preaching work?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Of course, persecution has not been the only reason for the growth of Christianity in foreign territories. In recent decades, political and economic changes have also opened up opportunities for the Kingdom message to spread to people of many languages and national groups. Some from war zones and economically depressed areas have fled to more stable places and have begun to study the Bible in the land to which they have relocated. An influx of refugees has caused foreign-speaking territories to open up.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Philip performed many signs in Samaria. For example, he healed those with disabilities and even cast out wicked spirits. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:6-44:8:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 8:6-8</a>) One man was particularly impressed with Philip’s miraculous gifts. He was Simon, a magician who was so highly regarded that people said of him: “This man is the Power of God.” Simon was now an eyewitness to the <em>real</em> power of God, as evidenced in the miracles performed by Philip, and Simon became a believer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:9-44:8:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 8:9-13</a>) Later, though, Simon’s motives were tested. How?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10. (a) What did Peter and John do in Samaria? (b) What did Simon do on seeing that new disciples received the holy spirit when Peter and John laid their hands on them?</p>

(See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009049/45-49">Peter Uses the ‘Keys of the Kingdom.’</a>”) On arriving, the two apostles laid their hands on the new disciples, whereupon each one received the holy spirit.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> When Simon saw this, he was intrigued. “Give me this authority also,” he told the apostles, “so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive holy spirit.” Simon even offered them money, hoping to buy this sacred privilege!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 8:14-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">11. What admonition does Peter give to Simon, and how does Simon respond?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Peter’s reply to Simon was firm. “May your silver perish with you,” said the apostle, “because you thought you could acquire the free gift of God with money. You have neither part nor share in this matter, for your heart is not straight in the sight of God.” Peter then urged Simon to repent and to pray for forgiveness. “Supplicate Jehovah,” said Peter, “that, if possible, the wicked intention of your heart [“this scheme of yours,” <em>New Jerusalem Bible</em>] may be forgiven you.” Evidently, Simon was not a wicked man; he <em>wanted</em> to do what was right, but he was momentarily misguided. So he pleaded with the apostles: “Make supplication <span id="page57" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>for me to Jehovah that none of the things you have said may come upon me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:20-44:8:24" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 8:20-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12. What is “simony,” and how has it proved to be a snare in Christendom?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> The rebuke that Peter gave Simon stands as a warning to Christians today. In fact, the English word “simony” was coined as a result of this incident. “Simony” refers to the buying or selling of positions, specifically in a religious context. The history of apostate Christendom is rife with examples of this practice. Indeed, the ninth edition of <em>The Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (1878) noted: “A study of the history of the Papal conclaves leaves the student with the conviction that no election untainted by simony has ever yet been made, while in a great number of instances the simony practised in the conclave has been of the grossest, most shameless, and most overt kind.”</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">13. In what ways must Christians be on guard against simony?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Christians must guard against the sin of simony. For instance, they should not try to gain favors by showering generous gifts or excessive praise on those who appear able to grant individuals added privileges in the congregation. On the other hand, those who are thought to be in a position to grant favors should be on guard against showing favoritism toward wealthy ones. Both situations involve simony. Really, all of God’s servants should conduct themselves as ‘lesser ones,’ waiting on Jehovah’s spirit to make appointments to privileges of service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:48-42:9:48" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 9:48</a>) There is no place in God’s organization for those who try to seek their “own glory.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:27-20:25:27" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 25:27</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa. 53:1-12</a>) Yet, as they traveled on, Philip explained to the Ethiopian eunuch that this prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Like those who were baptized at Pentecost 33 C.E., the Ethiopian​—who was already a Jewish proselyte—​immediately knew what he should do. “Look!” he said to Philip. “Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?” The Ethiopian was baptized by Philip without delay!<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009049/55-57">Baptism in ‘a Body of Water.’</a>”) Afterward, Philip was led to a new assignment in Ashdod, where he continued declaring the good news.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:32-44:8:40" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 8:32-40</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sc">The Greek term <em>eu·nouʹkhos,</em> rendered “eunuch,” can refer either to a man deprived of his ability to procreate or simply to a high-ranking court official. Court officials who oversaw the harem of a king may actually have been castrated, but emasculation was not a requirement for other officials, such as a king’s cupbearer or treasury overseer. The Ethiopian eunuch whom Philip baptized was evidently that type of official, for he oversaw a royal treasury. In effect, he was a minister of finance.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">The Ethiopian was also a proselyte​—that is, a non-Jew who had embraced the worship of Jehovah. Indeed, he had just been to Jerusalem to worship.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc">How is Christian baptism performed? Some believe that it is sufficient to pour or sprinkle water on a person’s head. However, the Ethiopian eunuch was baptized in “a body of water.” The account says: “Both Philip and the eunuch <em>went down into</em> the water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:36-44:8:36" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Acts 8:36,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:38-44:8:38" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 38</a>) If pouring or sprinkling water was all that was needed, it would not have been necessary for the eunuch to halt his chariot at a body of water.

<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">According to <em>A Greek-English Lexicon,</em> by Liddell and Scott, the Greek word <em>ba·ptiʹzo</em>​—from which the English “baptize” is derived—​means “to dip, to plunge.” Biblical references to baptism harmonize with this definition. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:23-43:3:23" data-bid="36-1" class="b">John 3:23</a> states that John “was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was a <em>great quantity</em> of water there.” Likewise, the account of Jesus’ baptism says: “On <em>coming up out of the water</em> [Jesus] saw the heavens being parted.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:9-41:1:10" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Mark 1:9, 10</a>) So true Christians are appropriately baptized by complete immersion in water.</p>

Often, they are able to present the Kingdom message to those they meet in informal settings, such as when traveling.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc">When Christ’s followers were scattered because of persecution, Philip went to Samaria. Evidently, he worked in close cooperation with the first-century governing body, for “when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.” The result was that the new believers there received the free gift of holy spirit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:17" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 8:14-17</a>.</p>

<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc">After the events recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:40" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Acts chapter 8</a>, Philip is mentioned just once more. Some 20 years after Philip’s initial preaching, the apostle Paul and his traveling companions were making their way to Jerusalem at the end of Paul’s third missionary journey. The group disembarked at Ptolemais. “The next day,” recounts Luke, “we left and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelizer, who was one of the seven men, and we stayed with him. This man had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:8-44:21:9" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Acts 21:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc">Apparently, Philip had settled in his preaching territory and was a family man. The fact that Luke refers to him as “the evangelizer” is significant. The Scriptures use this term to describe those who left their homes to preach the good news in unworked areas. Obviously, then, Philip’s zeal for the ministry remained strong. And the fact that he had four daughters who prophesied surely indicates that Philip taught his family to love and serve Jehovah.</p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div id="footnote1" data-fnid="1" class="fn-ref"><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> This is not the apostle Philip. Rather, it is the Philip who, as noted in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009046/">Chapter 5</a> of this book, was among the “seven reputable men” appointed to organize the daily distribution of food among the Greek-speaking and the Hebrew-speaking Christian widows in Jerusalem.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:1-44:6:6" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 6:1-6</a>.</p></div>
<div id="footnote2" data-fnid="2" class="fn-ref"><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> Evidently, new disciples at that time were usually anointed by, or received, holy spirit at their baptism. This put them in line for the future hope of ruling as kings and priests with Jesus in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:21-47:1:22" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Rev. 5:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 20:6</a>) However, in this particular case, the new disciples were not anointed at baptism. <em>Receiving</em> the holy spirit​—and the miraculous gifts that were associated with it—​took place only after Peter and John laid their hands on the newly baptized Christians.</p></div>
<div id="footnote3" data-fnid="3" class="fn-ref"><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><a href="#footnotesource3" class="fn-symbol">c</a> This was not an impulsive act. Since he was a Jewish proselyte, the Ethiopian already had a knowledge of the Scriptures, including the Messianic prophecies. Now that he had information about Jesus’ role in God’s purpose, he could get baptized without delay.</p></div>
