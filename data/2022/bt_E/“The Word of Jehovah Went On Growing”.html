<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WITH a resounding clang, the massive iron gate swings shut behind Peter. Shackled between two Roman guards, he is led off to his cell. He then endures long hours, perhaps days, of waiting to learn what is to be done with him. There is little for his gaze to fall on but his prison walls and bars, his chains, and his guards.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The news, when it comes, is grim.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">5, 6. (a) Why and how did King Herod Agrippa I attack the Christian congregation? (b) Why was the death of James a trial for the congregation?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> As we learned in the preceding chapter of this publication, the conversion of the Gentile Cornelius and his family was a thrilling development for the Christian congregation. But nonbelieving Jews must have <span id="page78" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>been shocked to learn that many Jewish Christians were now worshipping freely with non-Jews.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Herod, a canny politician, saw in this an opportunity to curry favor with the Jews, so he set about mistreating the Christians. No doubt, he learned that the apostle James had been especially close to Jesus Christ. Hence, Herod “put James the brother of John to death by the sword.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:2-44:12:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 12:2</a>) What a trial for the congregation! James was one of the three who had witnessed Jesus’ transfiguration and other miracles not revealed to the other apostles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:1-40:17:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 17:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:37-41:5:42" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Mark 5:37-42</a>) Jesus had called James and his brother John “Sons of Thunder” because of their fiery enthusiasm. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:17-41:3:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 3:17</a>) So the congregation lost a bold, faithful witness and beloved apostle.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">7, 8. How did the congregation respond to Peter’s imprisonment?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The execution of James pleased the Jews, just as Agrippa had hoped. Thus emboldened, he went after Peter next. As described at the outset, he had Peter arrested. Agrippa likely recalled, though, that prisons had not always proved effective in containing the apostles, as noted in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009046/">Chapter 5</a> of this book. Taking no chances, Herod had Peter chained between 2 guards, with 16 guards working in shifts day and night to make sure that this apostle did not escape. If he did, those guards would themselves face Peter’s sentence. Under such dire circumstances, what could Peter’s fellow Christians do?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> The congregation knew well what to do. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:5-44:12:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 12:5</a> reads: “So Peter was being kept in the prison, but the congregation was intensely praying <span id="page79" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="79" data-before-text="79"></span>to God for him.” Yes, their prayers in behalf of their beloved brother were intense, heartfelt pleas. The death of James had not plunged them into despair; nor had it caused them to view prayer as valueless. Prayers mean a great deal to Jehovah. If they are in harmony with his will, he will answer them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 13:18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:16-59:5:16" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Jas. 5:16</a>) This is a lesson that Christians today will want to take to heart.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 9. What can we learn from the example set by Peter’s fellow Christians in the matter of prayer?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Do you know of fellow believers who are beset by trials? They may be enduring persecution, governmental bans, or natural disasters. Why not make them the subject of your heartfelt prayers? You may also know of some who are undergoing less noticeable forms of hardship, such as family troubles, discouragement, or some challenge to their faith. If you meditate before praying, you may think of a number of people to mention by name as you speak to Jehovah, the “Hearer of prayer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>) After all, you need your brothers and sisters to do the same for you, should you come upon hard times.</p>

We cannot say for sure, but during that final night in prison, he was fast asleep between his two vigilant guards.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:7-45:14:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 14:7, 8</a>) At any rate, Peter could not have anticipated the amazing events that were about to unfold. Suddenly, a bright light filled his cell. An angel stood there, evidently unseen by the guards, and urgently <span id="page80" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="80" data-before-text="80"></span>awakened Peter.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> The angel gave Peter a series of terse commands: “Get up quickly! . . . Get dressed and put on your sandals. . . . Put your outer garment on.” Peter readily complied. Finally, the angel said: “Keep following me,” and Peter did so. They left the cell, walked right by the sentinel guards stationed outside, and made their way silently to the massive iron gate. How could they get through that? If such a thought even formed in Peter’s mind, it was short-lived. As they approached the gate, it “opened to them by itself.” Before Peter knew it, they passed through the gate and into the street, and then the angel vanished. Peter was left there, and the realization dawned on him that all of this had really happened. This was no vision. He was free!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:7-44:12:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 12:7-11</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Is it not comforting to contemplate Jehovah’s limitless power to rescue his servants? Peter was held captive by a king who was backed by the strongest governmental power the world had ever seen. Yet, Peter walked right out of prison! Granted, Jehovah does not perform such miracles for all his servants. He had not done so for James; nor did He do so for Peter later, when Jesus’ words about this apostle were finally fulfilled. Christians today do not expect miraculous deliverance. However, we keep in mind that Jehovah has not changed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:6-39:3:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mal. 3:6</a>) And he will soon use his Son to free countless millions from that most unyielding of prisons, death.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Peter stood in the dark street, deciding where to go next. Then he knew. Living nearby was a Christian woman named Mary. Evidently a widow of some means, Mary owned a house that was large enough to accommodate a congregation. She was the mother of John Mark, whom the Acts account mentions for the first time here and who eventually became like a son to Peter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:13-60:5:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:13</a>) On this night, many in that congregation were at Mary’s house despite the late hour, praying earnestly. No doubt they were praying for Peter’s release​—but they were not prepared for Jehovah’s answer!</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Peter knocked at the door of the gateway, which opened into a courtyard in front of the house. A servant girl named Rhoda​—a common Greek name meaning “Rose”—​came to the gate. She could not believe <span id="page81" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="81" data-before-text="81"></span>her ears. It was Peter’s voice! Instead of opening the gate, the excited girl left Peter standing in the street, ran back into the house, and tried to convince the congregation that Peter was there. They said she was mad, but she was not the type to be dissuaded. She kept asserting what she knew to be true. Giving in a bit, some suggested that it might be an angel who was representing Peter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:12-44:12:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 12:12-15</a>) All the while, Peter kept knocking until, finally, they went to the gate and opened it.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> At the gate, “they saw him and were astonished”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:16-44:12:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 12:16</a>) Peter had to quiet their happy hubbub so that he could tell his story, direct that it be passed along to the disciple James and the brothers, and then take his leave before Herod’s soldiers could find him. Peter went off to continue his faithful service somewhere safer. Except for his contribution toward resolving the circumcision issue, as mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:1-44:15:41" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts chapter 15</a>, he exits the account. The book of Acts next turns its focus to the work and travels of the apostle Paul. However, we can be sure that Peter strengthened the faith of his brothers and sisters wherever he went. When he left that group at Mary’s house, they were certainly in a joyful frame of mind.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">16. Why is the future sure to bring us many occasions for rejoicing?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Sometimes Jehovah gives his servants more than they could possibly expect, leaving them almost incredulous with joy.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 10:22</a>) In the future, we will see all of Jehovah’s promises being fulfilled on a global scale.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sc">Herod Agrippa I, who had James executed and Peter imprisoned, was the grandson of Herod the Great. The Herods were a dynasty of political rulers over the Jews. The family was Idumaean, that is, Edomite. The Idumaeans were nominally Jewish, since circumcision had been forced upon them in about 125 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc">Born in 10 B.C.E., Herod Agrippa I was educated in Rome. He cultivated friendships with various members of the imperial family. One of those friends was Gaius, better known as Caligula, who became emperor in 37 C.E. He soon proclaimed Agrippa king over Ituraea, Trachonitis, and Abilene. Later, Caligula expanded Agrippa’s domain to include Galilee and Perea.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc">Agrippa was in Rome when Caligula was assassinated in 41 C.E. Reportedly, Agrippa played an important role in resolving the crisis that ensued. He participated in the tense negotiations between another powerful friend, Claudius, and the Roman Senate. The result was that Claudius was proclaimed emperor and civil war was averted. To reward Agrippa for his mediation, Claudius granted him kingship also over Judea and Samaria, which had been administered by Roman procurators since 6 C.E. Thus Agrippa came to be in charge of territories equaling those of Herod the Great.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc">Agrippa’s capital was Jerusalem, where he won the favor of the religious leaders. He is said to have observed Jewish law and traditions scrupulously by, among other things, offering sacrifices in the temple daily, reading the Law publicly, and playing “the role of zealous protector of the Jewish faith.” However, he belied his claim of being a worshipper of God by arranging gladiatorial combats and pagan spectacles in the theater. Agrippa’s character has been described as “treacherous, superficial, extravagant.”</p>
