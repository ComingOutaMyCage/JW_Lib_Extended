<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Three days after taking office, Festus, the new Roman governor of Judea, went to Jerusalem.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> There he listened as the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews accused Paul of serious crimes. They knew that the new governor was under pressure to keep peace with them and all the Jews. So they asked a favor of Festus: Bring Paul to Jerusalem, and try him there. However, there was a dark plan behind this request. Those enemies were scheming to kill Paul on the road from Caesarea to Jerusalem. Festus turned them down, saying: “Let those who are in power among you . . . come down with me [to Caesarea] and accuse him if, indeed, the man has done something wrong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:5-44:25:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 25:5</a>) Therefore, Paul escaped death yet another time.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> During all of Paul’s trials, Jehovah through the Lord Jesus Christ sustained him. Recall that in a vision, Jesus told his apostle: “Take courage!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:11-44:23:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 23:11</a>) Today, God’s servants also face obstacles and <span id="page197" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="197" data-before-text="197"></span>threats.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5. How did Festus deal with Paul?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Some days later, Festus “sat down on the judgment seat” in Caesarea.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Before him stood Paul and Paul’s accusers. In answer to their baseless charges, Paul countered: “Neither against the Law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I committed any sin.” The apostle was innocent and deserved to be freed. How would Festus decide? Wanting to gain favor with the Jews, he asked Paul: “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be judged before me there concerning these things?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:6-44:25:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 25:6-9</a>) What an absurd proposal! If Paul were remanded to Jerusalem, his accusers would become his judges and he would face certain death. In this instance, Festus was choosing political expediency over true justice. An earlier governor, Pontius Pilate, had acted similarly in a case involving an even more important prisoner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:12-43:19:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 19:12-16</a>) Modern-day judges may also give in to political pressure. Therefore, we should not be surprised when courts decide contrary to evidence in cases involving God’s people.</p>

Therefore, Paul used a right he possessed as a Roman citizen. He told Festus: “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, of which you are also becoming well-aware. . . . I appeal to Caesar!” Once made, such an appeal was usually irrevocable. Festus emphasized this, saying: “To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you will go.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:10-44:25:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 25:10-12</a>) By appealing to a higher legal authority, Paul set a precedent for true Christians today.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">Jehovah’s Witnesses have at times appealed to high courts in hopes of removing obstacles to the preaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom. Here are two examples.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc">On March 28, 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned state court decisions and exonerated a group of Witnesses who had been arrested for distributing Bible literature in Griffin, Georgia, U.S.A. This was the first of many appeals made to that high court regarding the right of the Witnesses to preach the good news.<span data-fnid="7" class="fn">g<span id="footnotesource7" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="7"></span></span></p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sc">Another case involved a Witness in Greece named Minos Kokkinakis. Over a period of 48 years, he was arrested more than 60 times for “proselytism.” On 18 occasions, he faced prosecution in court. He spent years in prison and in exile on remote islands in the Aegean Sea. After his last conviction in 1986, Brother Kokkinakis lost his appeals to the higher courts of Greece. He then sought relief through the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). On May 25, 1993, that Court ruled that Greece had violated Brother Kokkinakis’ freedom of religion.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc">Jehovah’s Witnesses have appealed to the ECHR for relief in dozens of cases, prevailing in most of them. No other organization, religious or otherwise, has had such success in defending basic human rights before the ECHR.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">Do others benefit from the legal victories of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Scholar Charles C. Haynes wrote: “We all owe the Jehovah’s Witnesses a debt of gratitude. No matter how many times they’re insulted, run out of town or even physically attacked, they keep on fighting for their (and thus our) freedom of religion. And when they win, we all win.”</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10, 11. How did Paul accord Agrippa respect, and what details about Paul’s own past did the apostle reveal to the king?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Paul respectfully thanked King Agrippa for the opportunity to present a defense to him, acknowledging that the king was an expert on all the customs as well as the controversies among Jews. Paul then described his past life: “According to the strictest sect of our form of worship, I lived as a Pharisee.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:5-44:26:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 26:5</a>) As a Pharisee, Paul had hoped in the coming of the Messiah. Now, as a Christian, he boldly identified Jesus Christ as that long-awaited one. A belief that he and his accusers had in common​—that is, the hope of the fulfillment of God’s promise <span id="page199" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="199" data-before-text="199"></span>to their forefathers—​was the reason that Paul was on trial that day.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Recalling his past outrageous treatment of Christians, Paul said: “I, for one, was convinced that I should commit many acts of opposition against the name of Jesus the Nazarene. . . . Since I was extremely furious with them [the followers of Christ], I went so far as to persecute them even in outlying cities.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:9-44:26:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 26:9-11</a>) Paul was not exaggerating.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">12, 13. (a) How did Paul describe his conversion? (b) How had Paul been “kicking against the goads”?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Paul’s next words provided the answer: “As I was traveling to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests, I saw at midday on the road, O King, a light beyond the brilliance of the sun flash from heaven around me and around those traveling with me. And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice say to me in the Hebrew language: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? To keep kicking against the goads makes it hard for you.’ But I said: ‘Who are <span id="page200" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="200" data-before-text="200"></span>you, Lord?’ And the Lord said: ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.’”<span data-fnid="6" class="fn">f<span id="footnotesource6" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="6"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:12-44:26:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 26:12-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Before this supernatural event, Paul had figuratively been “kicking against the goads.” Just as a beast of burden would injure itself unnecessarily by kicking against the sharp end of an oxgoad, Paul had hurt himself spiritually by resisting the will of God. By appearing to Paul on the road to Damascus, the resurrected Jesus caused this sincere but clearly misguided man to change his thinking.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:1-43:16:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 16:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">14, 15. What did Paul say regarding the changes that he had made in his life?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Paul did indeed make drastic changes in his life. Addressing Agrippa, he said: “I did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision, but to those in Damascus first and then to those in Jerusalem, and over all the country of Judea, and also to the nations, I was bringing the message that they should repent and turn to God by doing works that befit repentance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:19-44:26:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 26:19, 20</a>) For years, Paul had been fulfilling the commission that Jesus Christ had given him in that midday vision. With what results? Those who responded to the good news that Paul preached repented of their immoral, dishonest conduct and turned to God. Such ones became good citizens, contributing to and showing respect for law and order.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Those benefits, however, meant nothing to Paul’s Jewish opposers.

However, because I have experienced the help that is from God, I continue to this day bearing witness to both small and great.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:21-44:26:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 26:21, 22</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> As they listened to Paul’s persuasive testimony, the two rulers could not remain detached. Note what took place: “Now as Paul was <span id="page202" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="202" data-before-text="202"></span>saying these things in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice: ‘You are going out of your mind, Paul!

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">18. How did Paul respond to Festus, leading to what response from Agrippa?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> But Paul had a reply for the governor: “I am not going out of my mind, Your Excellency Festus, but I am speaking words of truth and of a sound mind. For a fact, the king to whom I am speaking so freely well knows about these things . . . Do you, King Agrippa, believe the Prophets?

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Then Agrippa and Festus stood, signaling an end to the audience. “As they were leaving, they began saying to one another: ‘This man is doing nothing deserving of death or prison bonds.’ Agrippa then said to Festus: ‘This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:31-44:26:32" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 26:31, 32</a>) They knew that an innocent man had stood before them.

Was there wisdom in the apostle Paul’s appearing before those men? The answer is yes. Paul’s being “brought before kings and governors” in Judea resulted in a witness reaching areas of the Roman government that might then have been inaccessible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:12-42:21:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 21:12, 13</a>) Also, his experiences and faithfulness under trial encouraged his brothers and sisters in the faith.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:12-50:1:14" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Phil. 1:12-14</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc">Our only firsthand information about Porcius Festus comes from Acts of Apostles and the writings of Flavius Josephus.

</div>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sc">For the most part, Festus appears to have been a prudent and capable procurator, in contrast with his predecessor, Felix, and his successor, Albinus. At the beginning of Festus’ time in office, Judea was plagued by bandits. According to Josephus, “Festus . . . made it his business to correct those that made disturbances in the country. So he caught the greatest part of the robbers, and destroyed a great many of them.” During his tenure, the Jews built a wall to prevent King Agrippa from observing what took place in the temple area. Festus initially ordered them to dismantle it. At the Jews’ request, however, he later allowed them to present the matter to the Roman Emperor Nero.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc">Festus appears to have taken a firm stand against criminals and insurgents. But in his desire to maintain good relations with the Jews, he was willing to set aside justice​—at least in his dealings with the apostle Paul.</p>

<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sc">At the death of his father in 44 C.E., 17-year-old Agrippa was in Rome, where he was being educated at the court of Roman Emperor Claudius. The emperor’s advisers considered Agrippa too young to inherit his father’s domain; thus, a Roman governor was appointed instead. Even so, according to Flavius Josephus, while Agrippa was still in Rome, he intervened for the Jews and represented their interests.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sc">In about 50 C.E., Claudius assigned Agrippa kingship over Chalcis and in 53 C.E., over Ituraea, Trachonitis, and Abilene. Agrippa was also given oversight of Jerusalem’s temple, with authority to appoint the Jewish high priests. Claudius’ successor Nero extended Agrippa’s realm to include parts of Galilee and Perea. At the time of his meeting Paul, Agrippa was in Caesarea with his sister Bernice, who had left her husband, the king of Cilicia.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:13-44:25:13" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 25:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="sc">In 66 C.E., when Agrippa’s efforts failed to calm the Jewish rebellion against Rome, he himself became a target of the rebels, and he was left no choice but to join the Romans. After the Jewish revolt was crushed, a new emperor, Vespasian, gave Agrippa further territories as a reward.</p>
