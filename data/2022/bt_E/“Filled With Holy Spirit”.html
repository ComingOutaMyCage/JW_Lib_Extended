This city stands among the hills of Judea’s central mountain range, about 34 miles (55 km) east of the Mediterranean Sea. In 1070 B.C.E., King David conquered the hilltop fortress of Mount Zion, located here, and the city that grew up around it became the capital of the ancient nation of Israel.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">Close by Mount Zion stands Mount Moriah, where, according to ancient Jewish tradition, Abraham attempted to sacrifice Isaac, some 1,900 years before the events described in Acts. Mount Moriah became part of the city when Solomon built the first temple of Jehovah atop it. This edifice came to be the focal point of Jewish public life and worship.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc">It was to Jehovah’s temple that all devout Jews regularly gathered from all over the inhabited earth to sacrifice, worship, and observe seasonal festivals. They did so in obedience to God’s command: “Three times a year, all your males should appear before Jehovah your God in the place that he chooses.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:16-5:16:16" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Deut. 16:16</a>) Jerusalem was also the seat of the Great Sanhedrin, the Jewish high court and national administrative council.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> At about nine o’clock on this mild spring morning in 33 C.E., something happens that will be marveled at for centuries to come. Suddenly, there occurs “a noise from heaven, just like that of a rushing, stiff breeze,” or “like the roaring of a mighty windstorm.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:2-44:2:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 2:2</a>; <em>International Standard Version</em>) The loud sound fills the house where about 120 disciples of Jesus are gathered.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">During the period of time covered by the book of Acts, Rome was the largest and politically the most important city in the then-known world. It was the capital of an empire that at its peak dominated lands stretching from Britain to North Africa and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">Rome was a melting pot of cultures, races, languages, and superstitions. A network of well-maintained roads brought travelers and merchandise from every corner of the empire. At the nearby port of Ostia, ships that plied busy trade routes unloaded foodstuffs and luxury goods destined for the city.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">By the first century C.E., well over a million people lived in Rome. Perhaps half of the population were slaves​—condemned criminals, children sold or abandoned by their parents, and prisoners captured during campaigns by the Roman legions. Among those brought to Rome as slaves were Jews from Jerusalem, following the conquest of that city by Roman General Pompey in 63 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc">Most of the free population were paupers, who lived in crowded multistory housing and depended on government subsidies. The emperors, however, adorned their capital with some of the most magnificent public buildings ever seen. Among them were theaters and great stadiums that offered such spectacles as stage performances, gladiatorial contests, and chariot racing​—all free for the entertainment of the masses.</p>

Of course, it is a challenge to reach people of different languages. Yet, Jehovah’s Witnesses have produced Bible-based material in more than 1,000 languages. If you are actively associated with the Christian congregation and are sharing in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work, you have reason to rejoice.

But now “each one heard [the disciples] speaking in his own language.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:6-44:2:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 2:6</a>) Surely those listeners must have been touched to hear the good news in their mother tongue. Of course, Christians today are not gifted with a miraculous ability to speak foreign tongues. Many, however, have made themselves available to spread the Kingdom message to people of all national groups. How? Some have learned a new language so that they can serve with a nearby foreign-language congregation or even move to a foreign land.

One way is by using the <em>JW Language</em><sup>®</sup> app to learn a simple greeting in a language commonly spoken in your area. You can also learn a few phrases in that language that may arouse the interest of those who speak it. Direct them to jw.org, and perhaps show them the variety of videos and publications available in their language. By using such tools in our ministry, we may have the same joy that our first-century brothers had when people from foreign lands were amazed to hear the good news “each one . . . in his own language.”</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sc"><em>The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ</em> (175 B.C.–A.D. 135) states: “In <em>Mesopotamia, Media</em> and <em>Babylonia</em> lived the descendants of members of the kingdom of the ten tribes [of Israel], and of the kingdom of Judah, once deported there by the Assyrians and the Babylonians.” According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:64-15:2:64" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezra 2:64</a>, only 42,360 Israelites returned to Jerusalem from their Babylonian exile. This took place in 537 B.C.E. Flavius Josephus remarks that in the first century C.E., the Jews who “dwelt about Babylonia” numbered into the tens of thousands. In the third to the fifth centuries C.E., these communities produced the work known as the Babylonian Talmud.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc">Documentary evidence exists of a Jewish presence in Egypt at least as early as the sixth century B.C.E. During that period, Jeremiah directed a message to Jews living in various localities of Egypt, including Memphis. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:44:1-24:44:1" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jer. 44:1</a>, ftn.) It is likely that large numbers immigrated to Egypt during the Hellenistic period. Josephus says that Jews were among the first settlers of Alexandria. In time, an entire section of this city was allotted to them. In the first century C.E., Jewish writer Philo asserted that a million of his fellow countrymen lived throughout Egypt, from “the side of Libya to the boundaries of Ethiopia.”</p>

Yet, as a nation they bore community responsibility for this act. Note, though, that Peter addressed his fellow Jews respectfully and appealed to their hearts. Peter’s goal was to move his listeners to repentance, not to condemn them. Did the crowd listening take offense at Peter’s words? By no means. Instead, the people were “stabbed to the heart.” They asked: “What should we do?” Peter’s positive approach likely played a role in his reaching the hearts of many, so that they were moved to repent.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:37-44:2:37" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 2:37</a>.</p>

<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sc">Further tests faced by Christians in Pontus are alluded to in correspondence between Pliny the Younger, governor of the Roman province of Bithynia and Pontus, and Emperor Trajan. Writing from Pontus in about 112 C.E., Pliny reported that the “contagion” of Christianity threatened everyone, regardless of gender, age, or rank. Pliny gave those accused of being Christians opportunity to deny it, and those who would not, he executed. Any who cursed Christ or recited a prayer to the gods or to Trajan’s statue were released. Pliny acknowledged that these were things that “those who are really Christians cannot be made to do.”</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="sc">“Both Jews and proselytes” heard Peter’s preaching at Pentecost 33 C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:10-44:2:10" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Acts 2:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="sc">Among the qualified men appointed to care for the “necessary matter” of the daily distribution of food was Nicolaus, who is identified as “a proselyte of Antioch.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:3-44:6:5" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Acts 6:3-5</a>) Proselytes were Gentiles, that is, non-Jews, who had converted to Judaism. They were considered Jews in all respects, since they accepted the God and the Law of Israel, rejected all other gods, underwent circumcision (if male), and joined themselves to the nation of Israel.</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="sc">After the Jews were released from exile in Babylon in 537 B.C.E., many settled far from the land of Israel but continued to practice Judaism. By this means, people throughout the ancient Near East and beyond became acquainted with the Jewish religion. Ancient writers, such as Horace and Seneca, testify that multitudes in different lands who were attracted to the Jews and their beliefs joined their communities and became proselytes.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Christian dedication and baptism involve several necessary Scriptural steps. A person must take in knowledge of God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) He needs to exercise faith and must repent over his past course, demonstrating true sorrow over it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) Then he must convert, or turn around, and start engaging in right works that are in harmony with God’s will.
