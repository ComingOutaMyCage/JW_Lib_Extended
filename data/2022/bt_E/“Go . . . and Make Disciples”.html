<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu">1-6. Relate an experience of Witnesses preaching under a wide variety of circumstances.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>REBECCA, a young Witness of Jehovah in Ghana, regarded her school as her own preaching territory. She always had Bible-based literature in her schoolbag. During break time, she looked for opportunities to give a witness to fellow students. Rebecca started Bible studies with several of her classmates.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> On the island of Madagascar, just off the east coast of Africa, two pioneers regularly walked some 15 miles (25 km) in the tropical heat to get to a remote village. There they conducted a number of Bible studies with interested ones.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> To reach people living along the Paraguay and Paraná rivers, Witnesses in Paraguay together with volunteers from 15 other countries worked to build a riverboat. The 45-ton boat can accommodate up to 12 people. From this floating home, zealous Kingdom preachers spread the good news into areas that were otherwise inaccessible.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> In the Far North, Witnesses in Alaska took advantage of a unique opportunity to preach during the summer tourist season. When warmer weather brought cruise ships loaded with visitors of many different nationalities, local Witnesses stationed themselves on the dock with an attractive display of Bible literature in a wide variety of languages. In that same region, an airplane proved invaluable in reaching isolated villages, thus allowing the good news to be spread to Aleut, Athabascan, Tsimshian, and Tlingit communities.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Larry, in Texas, U.S.A., had a special territory​—the nursing home in which he resided. Although confined to a wheelchair as a result of an accident, Larry kept busy. He shared with others the Kingdom message, including his Bible-based hope that under Kingdom rule he will one day walk again.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 35:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> To attend an assembly in upper Myanmar, a group of Witnesses made a three-day journey by ferryboat from Mandalay. Eager to preach the good news, they took along Bible literature, which they offered to fellow passengers. Each time the ferry stopped at a town or a village, the energetic preachers got off and quickly went through the settlement, <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>offering literature. In the meantime, new passengers boarded the ferry, becoming “fresh territory” for the returning Kingdom publishers.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 7. In what ways do worshippers of Jehovah bear witness about God’s Kingdom, and what is their goal?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Like the brothers and sisters mentioned in these few examples, zealous worshippers of Jehovah around the world are “bearing thorough witness concerning the Kingdom of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:23-44:28:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 28:23</a>) They call from house to house, approach people on the street, write them letters, and speak to them over the phone. Whether riding on a bus, walking in a park, or taking a break at their place of secular work, they eagerly look for every opportunity to give a witness about God’s Kingdom. The specific methods may vary, but the goal is the same​—preach the good news wherever people can be found.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu">8, 9. (a) Why is the expansion of the Kingdom-preaching work nothing short of miraculous? (b) What intriguing question is raised, and what do we need to do to find the answer?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Are you, dear reader, among the throngs of Kingdom proclaimers who are now active in more than 235 lands? If so, you play a part in the thrilling expansion of the Kingdom-preaching work! What has been accomplished in the worldwide field is nothing short of miraculous. In spite of formidable obstacles and challenges​—even governmental bans and outright persecution—​Jehovah’s Witnesses are giving a thorough witness about God’s Kingdom to people of all nations.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> An intriguing question to consider is, Why has no obstacle, not even satanic opposition, been able to stop the forward movement of the Kingdom-preaching work? To answer that question, we need to look back to the first century C.E. After all, we modern-day Witnesses of Jehovah are continuing the work that started back then.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">10. To what did Jesus devote himself, and what did he know about this work?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> The Founder of the Christian congregation, Jesus Christ, devoted himself to the preaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom; it was his lifework. He once explained: “I must also declare the good news of the Kingdom of God to other cities, because for this I was sent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>) Jesus knew that he was initiating a work that he could not complete all by himself. Shortly before his death, he foretold that the Kingdom message would be preached “in all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a>) How, though, would this be done, and by whom?</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">11. What weighty commission did Jesus give his disciples, and what support would they have in carrying it out?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Following his death and resurrection, Jesus appeared to his <span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>disciples and gave them this weighty commission: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) The words “I am with you” indicated that the disciples would have his backing in the preaching and disciple-making work. They would need such support, for Jesus had foretold that they would be “hated by all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9</a>) The disciples could count on something else for support. Just before ascending to heaven, Jesus told them that they would be empowered by holy spirit to be his witnesses “to the most distant part of the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">12. What important questions arise, and why is it vital that we know the answers?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Now some important questions arise: Did Jesus’ apostles and the other first-century disciples take their commission seriously? Did this relatively small band of Christian men and women bear thorough witness about the Kingdom of God even in the face of vicious persecution? Did they really have heavenly backing and the support of Jehovah’s holy spirit in their disciple-making work? These and related questions are answered in the Bible book of Acts. It is vital that we know the answers. Why? Jesus promised that the work he commissioned would continue “until the conclusion of the system of things.” So this commission applies to all true Christians, including those of us living in this time of the end. We therefore have a keen interest in the historical record contained in the book of Acts.</p>

<h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>Overview of the Book of Acts</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">13, 14. (a) Who wrote the book of Acts, and how did the writer obtain his information? (b) What does the book of Acts contain?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Who wrote the book of Acts? The book itself never names its writer, but the opening words make it clear that the writer of Acts was also the writer of the Gospel of Luke. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:1-42:1:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 1:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:1-44:1:2" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Acts 1:1, 2</a>) Thus, from early times, Luke, a “beloved physician” and a careful historian, has been held to be the writer of Acts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:14-51:4:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Col. 4:14</a>) The book covers a period of about 28 years, from Jesus’ ascension in 33 C.E. to the apostle Paul’s imprisonment in Rome about 61 C.E. The fact that Luke changes from “they” to “we” in his narrative suggests that he was present at many of the events that he describes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:8-44:16:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 16:8-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:5-44:20:5" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 20:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:1-44:27:1" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 27:1</a>) A meticulous researcher, Luke no doubt obtained information firsthand from Paul, Barnabas, Philip, and others mentioned in the record.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> What does the book of Acts contain? Earlier, in his Gospel, Luke wrote about the things that Jesus said and did. In the book of Acts, <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>however, Luke reports what Jesus’ followers said and did. Acts, then, is about people who accomplished an extraordinary work, although many of them were viewed by outsiders as “uneducated and ordinary.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:13-44:4:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 4:13</a>) In brief, the inspired record tells us how the Christian congregation was founded and how it grew. Acts shows how the first-century Christians preached​—their methods and their attitude. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:31-44:4:31" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 4:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 5:42</a>) It highlights the role of holy spirit in spreading the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:29-44:8:29" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 8:29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:39-44:8:40" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 39, 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:1-44:13:3" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 13:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:6-44:16:6" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 16:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:24-44:18:25" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> 18:24, 25</a>) Acts picks up the Bible’s theme, which involves the sanctification of God’s name by means of his Kingdom under Christ, and shows the triumphant spread of the Kingdom message in the face of fierce opposition.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:12-44:8:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 8:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:8-44:19:8" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:30-44:28:31" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 28:30, 31</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Indeed, it is thrilling and faith-strengthening to examine the Bible book of Acts! If we reflect on the bold and zealous example of Christ’s early followers, our hearts will be touched. We will be moved to imitate the faith of our first-century counterparts. We will thus be better equipped to fulfill our commission to “go . . . and make disciples.” The publication that you are now reading is designed to help you make a careful study of the book of Acts.</p>
