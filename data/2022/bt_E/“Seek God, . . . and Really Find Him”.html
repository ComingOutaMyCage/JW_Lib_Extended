<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>PAUL is greatly disturbed. He is in Athens, Greece, the center of learning where Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle once taught. Athens is a most religious city. All around him​—in temples, in public squares, and on the streets—​Paul sees an array of idols, for Athenians worship a pantheon of gods. Paul knows how Jehovah, the true God, views idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:4-2:20:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 20:4, 5</a>) The faithful apostle shares Jehovah’s view​—he abhors idols!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> What Paul sees upon entering the agora, or marketplace, is especially shocking. A large number of phallic statues of the god Hermes line the northwest corner, near the principal entrance. The marketplace is filled with shrines. How will the zealous apostle preach in this deeply idolatrous climate? Will he control his emotions and find common ground with his audience? Will he succeed in helping any to seek the true God and really find Him?</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Paul visited Athens on his second missionary journey, in about 50 C.E.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> While waiting for Silas and Timothy to arrive from Beroea, Paul “began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews,” as was his custom. He also sought out a territory where he could reach Athens’ non-Jewish citizens​—“in the marketplace,” or agora. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:17-44:17:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 17:17</a>) Located northwest of the Acropolis, Athens’ agora covered 12 acres (5 ha) or so. The marketplace was much more than a location for buying and selling; it <span id="page141" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="141" data-before-text="141"></span>was the city’s public square. One reference work notes that this place was “the economic, political and cultural heart of the city.” Athenians delighted to convene there and engage in intellectual discussion.</p>
<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div id="p57" data-pid="57" class="boxTtl rule"><h2><strong>ATHENS​—CULTURAL CAPITAL OF THE ANCIENT WORLD</strong></h2></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">The Acropolis of Athens was a strongly fortified citadel well before the city’s history began to be recorded in the seventh century B.C.E. Athens became the chief city of the district of Attica and dominated an area of some 1,000 square miles (2,500 sq km), bounded by mountains and sea. The city’s name seems to be related to that of its patron goddess, Athena.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">In the sixth century B.C.E., an Athenian legislator named Solon reformed the social, political, juridical, and economic structures of the city. He improved the lot of the poor and laid the basis for a democratic form of government. It was a democracy only for the free, however, and a large part of the city’s population was made up of slaves.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc">Following Greek victories over the Persians in the fifth century B.C.E., Athens became the capital of a small empire that extended its maritime trade from Italy and Sicily in the west to Cyprus and Syria in the east. At the height of its splendor, Athens was the cultural center of the ancient world, excelling in art, drama, philosophy, rhetoric, and science. Many public buildings and temples adorned the city. Its skyline was dominated by the Acropolis, a commanding hill on which stood the Parthenon and its 40-foot (12 m) gold and ivory statue of Athena.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc">Athens was conquered first by the Spartans, then by the Macedonians, and finally by the Romans, who stripped the city of its wealth. Even so, in the time of the apostle Paul, Athens still enjoyed a privileged status because of its illustrious past. In fact, the city was never incorporated into any Roman province but was granted juridical authority over its own citizens and exemption from Roman taxes. Though its greatest glories were gone, Athens remained a university city, where the sons of the wealthy were sent to study.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Paul faced a challenging audience at the marketplace. Among his listeners were Epicureans and Stoics, members of rival schools of philosophy.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> The Epicureans believed that life came into existence by accident. Their view of life was summed up as follows: “Nothing to fear in God; Nothing to feel in death; Good can be achieved; Evil can be endured.” The Stoics stressed reason and logic and did not believe God to be a Person. Neither the Epicureans nor the Stoics believed in the resurrection as taught by Christ’s disciples. Clearly, the philosophical views of these two groups were incompatible with the elevated truths of genuine Christianity, which Paul was preaching.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">6, 7. How did some of the Greek intellectuals react to Paul’s teaching, and what similar reaction may we encounter today?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> How did the Greek intellectuals react to Paul’s teaching? Some used a word that means “chatterer,” or “seed picker.” (See study note on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:18-44:17:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 17:18</a>, <em>nwtsty.</em>) Regarding this Greek term, one scholar states: “The word was originally used of a small bird that went around picking up grain, and later was applied to persons who picked up food scraps and other odds and ends in the market place. Still later it came to be used figuratively of any person who picked up odd bits of information, and especially of one who was unable to put them together properly.” In effect, those learned men were saying that Paul was an ignorant plagiarist. Yet, as we will see, Paul was not intimidated by such name-calling.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> It is no different today. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we have often been the target of name-calling because of our Bible-based beliefs. For example, some educators teach that evolution is a fact and insist that if you are intelligent, you must accept it. They, in effect, label as ignorant those who refuse to believe in it. Such learned men would have people think that we are ‘seed pickers’ when we present what the Bible says and point to the evidence of design in nature. But we are not intimidated. On the contrary, we speak with confidence when defending our belief that life on earth is the product of an intelligent Designer, Jehovah God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:18-44:17:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 17:18</a>) Was Paul really introducing new gods to the Athenians? This was a serious matter, echoing one of the charges for which <span id="page142" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="142" data-before-text="142"></span>Socrates had been tried and condemned to death centuries earlier.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc">The Epicureans and Stoics were followers of two separate schools of philosophy. Neither believed in a resurrection.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sc">The Epicureans believed in the existence of gods but thought that the gods had no interest in men and would neither reward nor punish them, so prayer or sacrifice was useless. Epicureans held pleasure to be the supreme good in life. Their thinking and actions were devoid of moral principle. Moderation was urged, however, on the grounds that it prevented the negative consequences of overindulgence. Knowledge was sought only to rid a person of religious fears and superstition.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sc">The Stoics, on the other hand, believed that all things were part of an impersonal deity and that the human soul emanated from such a source. Some Stoics held that the soul would eventually be destroyed along with the universe. Other Stoics believed that the soul would ultimately be reabsorbed by this deity. According to Stoic philosophers, happiness was to be obtained by following nature.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">9-11. (a) How did Paul endeavor to establish common ground with his audience? (b) How can we imitate Paul’s example in our ministry?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Recall that Paul was greatly disturbed by all the idolatry he had seen. Rather than unleash an unbridled attack on idol worship, however, he maintained his composure. With the utmost tact, he endeavored to win over his audience by establishing common ground. He began: “Men of Athens, I see that in all things you seem to be more given <span id="page143" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="143" data-before-text="143"></span>to the fear of the deities than others are.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:22-44:17:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 17:22</a>) In a sense, Paul was saying, ‘I see that you are very religious.’ Wisely, Paul commended them for being religiously inclined. He recognized that some who are blinded by false beliefs may have receptive hearts. After all, Paul knew that he himself had once “acted in ignorance and with a lack of faith.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:13-54:1:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Building on common ground, Paul mentioned that he had observed tangible evidence of the Athenians’ religiousness​—an altar dedicated “To an Unknown God.” According to one source, “it was customary for Greeks and others to dedicate altars to ‘unknown gods,’ for fear that in their worship they had omitted some god who might otherwise be offended.” By means of such an altar, the Athenians admitted the existence of a God who was unknown to them. Paul used the presence of this altar to make a transition into the good news that he was preaching. He explained: “What you are unknowingly worshipping, this I am declaring to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:23-44:17:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 17:23</a>) Paul’s reasoning was subtle but powerful. He was not preaching a new or strange god, as some had charged. He was explaining the God that was unknown to them​—the true God.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> How can we imitate Paul’s example in our ministry? If we are observant, we may see evidence that a person is religiously devout, perhaps by noting some religious item that he is wearing or that is displayed on his home or in the yard. We might say: ‘I see that you are a religious person. I was hoping to talk to someone who is religiously inclined.’ By tactfully acknowledging the person’s religious feelings, we may establish common ground on which to build. Remember that it is not our aim to prejudge others based on their religious convictions. Among our fellow worshippers are many who at one time sincerely embraced false religious beliefs.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Paul had established common ground but could he maintain it when giving a witness? Knowing that his listeners were educated in Greek philosophy and unfamiliar with the Scriptures, he adapted his approach in several ways. First, he presented Biblical teachings without directly quoting from the Scriptures. Second, he identified himself with his listeners, at times using the words “us” and “we.” Third, he quoted from Greek literature to show that certain things he was teaching were expressed in their own writings. Let us now examine Paul’s powerful speech. What important truths did he convey about the God who was unknown to the Athenians?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">13. What did Paul explain about the origin of the universe, and what was the implication of his words?</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> <em>God is not dependent on humans.</em> Idolaters were accustomed to clothing their images with lavish garments, showering them with expensive gifts, or bringing them food and drink​—as if the idols needed such things! However, some of the Greek philosophers in Paul’s audience may have believed that a god would need nothing from humans. If so, they no doubt agreed with Paul’s statement that God is not “served by human hands as if he needed anything.” Indeed, there is nothing material that humans can give to the Creator! Rather, he gives humans what they need​—“life and breath and all things,” including the sun, the rain, and fruitful soil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:25-44:17:25" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 17:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Gen. 2:7</a>) So God, the Giver, is not dependent on humans, the receivers.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">15. How did Paul address the Athenians’ belief that they were superior to non-Greeks, and what important lesson can we learn from his example?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-28</a>) Since all humans have a common ancestor, no race or nationality is superior to another. How could any of Paul’s listeners miss the point? We learn an important lesson from his example. While we want to be tactful and reasonable in our witnessing work, we do not want to water down Bible truth so as to make it more acceptable to others.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> <em>God purposed that humans be close to him.</em> Even if the philosophers in Paul’s audience had long debated the purpose of human existence, they could never have explained it satisfactorily. Paul, however, clearly revealed the Creator’s purpose for humans, namely for them to “seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:27" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 17:27</a>) The God who was unknown to the Athenians is by no means unknowable.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> The apostle made it clear that action was needed: “God has overlooked the times of such ignorance [of imagining that God could be pleased with humans who worshipped idols]; but now he is declaring to all people everywhere that they should repent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:30-44:17:30" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 17:30</a>) Some of Paul’s listeners might have been shocked to hear this call for repentance.

Paul did not name the appointed Judge. Rather, Paul said something startling about this Judge: He had lived as a man, died, and been raised from the dead by God!</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong></span> That rousing conclusion is filled with meaning for us today.

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong></span> There were mixed reactions to Paul’s speech. “Some began to scoff” when they heard of a resurrection. Others were polite but noncommittal, saying: “We will hear you again about this.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:32-44:17:32" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 17:32</a>) A few, however, responded positively: “Some men joined him and became believers. Among them were Dionysius, who was a judge of the court of the Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris, and others besides them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:34-44:17:34" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Acts 17:34</a>) We experience similar reactions in our ministry. Some people may deride us, while others respond with polite indifference. However, we are thrilled when some accept the Kingdom message and become believers.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">24. What can we learn from the speech that Paul gave as he stood in the midst of the Areopagus?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong></span> As we reflect on Paul’s speech, we can learn much about logical development and convincing argumentation as well as how to adapt to our audience. In addition, we can learn about the need to be patient and tactful with those who are blinded by false religious beliefs. We can also learn this important lesson: We must never compromise Bible truth just to appease our listeners. Yet, by imitating the example of the apostle Paul, we can become more effective teachers in the field ministry. Furthermore, overseers can thereby become better qualified teachers in the congregation. We will thus be well-equipped to help others to “seek God . . . and really find him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:27" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Acts 17:27</a>.</p>

The term “Areopagus” may refer either to the council or to the actual hill. Hence, there are differences of opinion among scholars as to whether Paul was brought to or near this hill or to a meeting of the council elsewhere, perhaps in the agora.</p></div>
