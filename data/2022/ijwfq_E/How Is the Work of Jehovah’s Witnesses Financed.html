<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Jehovah’s Witnesses are not expected to tithe or to donate any specific amount or percentage of their income. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>) We never take collections or charge admission at our meetings, nor do our ministers charge fees for baptisms, funerals, weddings, or other religious services. We do not raise money through bake sales, bazaars, bingo games, carnivals, dinners, raffles, or similar events, nor do we solicit donations. Donors’ information is never shared or made available to the public. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:2-40:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:2-4</a>) Our websites and publications do not contain revenue-generating advertisements.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Every congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses provides monthly financial reports at its meetings, which are open to the public. The accounting records of each congregation are audited regularly to ensure that donated funds are being handled properly.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:20-47:8:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 8:20, 21</a>.</p>
