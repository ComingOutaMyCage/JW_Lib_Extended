<h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>Why Jehovah’s Witnesses believe they should marry only within their religion</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>The Witnesses heed the Bible’s instruction to marry “only in the Lord,” that is, to marry a person who shares their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:​39</a>) This command is both Biblical and practical. For example, a 2010 article in the <em>Journal of Marriage and Family</em> said that “couples in which partners share common religious affiliations, practices, and beliefs” tend to have higher quality relationships.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>However, the Witnesses do not encourage those who belong to their faith to separate from a marriage mate who is not a Witness. The Bible says: “If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is agreeable to staying with him, let him not leave her; and if a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is agreeable to staying with her, let her not leave her husband.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:12-46:7:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:​12, 13</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses abide by this command.</p>
