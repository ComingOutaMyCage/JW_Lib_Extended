<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>No, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not practice tithing; our work is financed by voluntary donations. What is a tithe, and why don’t Jehovah’s Witnesses practice tithing?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The commandment to tithe, or contribute a tenth of one’s belongings, was part of the Law given to the ancient nation of Israel. However, the Bible makes it clear that this Law​—including the “commandment to collect tithes”​—does not apply to Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:5-58:7:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:​5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:18-58:7:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:13-51:2:14" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Colossians 2:​13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Rather than giving required tithes and offerings, Jehovah’s Witnesses imitate the early Christians and support their ministry in two ways: by performing their personal ministerial work without pay and by making voluntary donations.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>We thus follow the Bible’s direction to Christians: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>.</p>
