<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>No. Jehovah’s Witnesses <em>do</em> believe that God created everything. But we <em>do not</em> agree with creationism. Why not? Because a number of creationist ideas actually conflict with the Bible. Consider the following two examples:</p>
<ol><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>              <strong>Length of the six days of creation.</strong> Some creationists assert that the six days of creation were literal 24-hour days. But the word “day” in the Bible can refer to a considerable length of time.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:4-1:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:4-19:90:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Psalm 90:4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>              <strong>Age of the earth.</strong> Some creationists teach that the earth is just a few thousand years old. However, according to the Bible, the earth and the universe existed <em>before</em> the six days of creation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a>) For that reason, Jehovah’s Witnesses have no objection to credible scientific research that indicates the earth may be billions of years old.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Although Jehovah’s Witnesses believe in creation, we are <em>not</em> antiscience. We believe that true science and the Bible are compatible.</p>
