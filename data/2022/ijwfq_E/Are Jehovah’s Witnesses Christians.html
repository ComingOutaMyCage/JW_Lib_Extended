<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes. We are Christians for the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  We try to follow closely the teachings and behavior of Jesus Christ.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  We believe that Jesus is the key to salvation, that “there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:12-44:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 4:12</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  When people become Jehovah’s Witnesses, they are baptized in the name of Jesus.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 28:18, 19</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  We offer our prayers in Jesus’ name.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:16-43:15:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 15:16</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  We believe that Jesus is the Head, or the one appointed to have authority, over every man.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>However, in a number of ways, we are different from other religious groups that are called Christian. For example, we believe that the Bible teaches that Jesus is the Son of God, not part of a Trinity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:29-41:12:29" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 12:29</a>) We do not believe that the soul is immortal, that there is any basis in Scripture for saying that God tortures people in an everlasting hell, or that those who take the lead in religious activities should have titles that elevate them above others.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:4-26:18:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 18:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:10" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Matthew 23:8-10</a>.</p>
