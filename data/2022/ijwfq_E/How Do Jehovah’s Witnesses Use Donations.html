<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>We use donations to support the religious and humanitarian activities of our organization. We carry out these activities as part of our primary mission, which is to help people become disciples of Christ Jesus.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>We never use donations to enrich any individual. We have no <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012476/">paid elders or clergy</a>, and Jehovah’s Witnesses are not paid to go from door to door. Those who serve at our branch offices and at our world headquarters, including those making up the Governing Body, are unsalaried members of a religious order.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Publishing:</strong> We translate, print, ship, and distribute millions of Bibles and other Christian publications each year, all without charge. Likewise, the jw.org website and the <a class="xt" data-xtid="93" href="jwpub://p/E:802013025/"><em>JW Library</em></a> app make our digital publications available without charge or advertisements.</p>

<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Construction and Maintenance:</strong> We build and maintain modest places of worship around the world to enable our congregations to have suitable locations to meet together and praise God. We do the same for branch offices and translation offices. Much of this work is done by volunteers, which helps to lower costs.</p>
