(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:20-46:11:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>; <em>King James Version</em>) In contrast, many beliefs and practices of other denominations in connection with this observance are not based on the Bible.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The purpose of the Lord’s Evening Meal is to remember Jesus, showing our gratitude for his sacrifice in our behalf.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Jesus commanded his disciples to commemorate the Lord’s Evening Meal, but he did not specifically say how often. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>) Some feel that it should be observed monthly, while others observe it weekly, daily, several times each day, or as often as a person feels is appropriate.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> However, here are some factors that should be considered.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Jesus instituted the Lord’s Evening Meal on the date of the Jewish Passover, and he died later that same day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:1-40:26:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 26:​1, 2</a>) This was no coincidence. The Scriptures compare Jesus’ sacrifice to that of the Passover lamb. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:7-46:5:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:​7, 8</a>) The Passover was observed once each year. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:1-2:12:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 12:​1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:5-3:23:5" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Leviticus 23:5</a>) Likewise, the Memorial of Jesus’ death was observed once each year by the early Christians,<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> and Jehovah’s Witnesses follow that Bible-based pattern.</p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Date and time</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The pattern established by Jesus helps determine not only the frequency but also the date and time of the Memorial. He introduced the observance after sundown on Nisan 14, 33 C.E., according to the Bible’s lunar calendar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:18-40:26:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 26:18-​20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:26-40:26:26" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 26</a>) We continue to observe the Memorial on this date each year, following the practice of early Christians.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Although Nisan 14, 33 C.E. was a Friday, the anniversary of that date might fall on a different day of the week each year.

</div>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>For the new observance, Jesus used unleavened bread and red wine that were left over from the Passover meal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:26-40:26:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 26:26-​28</a>) Following his example, we use bread without leaven or added ingredients and plain red wine, not grape juice or wine that has been sweetened, fortified, or spiced.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Some denominations use bread with leavening or yeast, but leaven is often used in the Bible as a symbol of sin and corruption. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:1-42:12:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:6-46:5:8" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 5:​6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:7-48:5:9" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Galatians 5:​7-9</a>) Thus, only bread free from leaven and other additives can be a fitting symbol for Christ’s sinless body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:22-60:2:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:​22</a>) Another practice not supported by the Bible is that of substituting unfermented grape juice for wine. Some churches do so because of their unscriptural prohibition against consuming alcohol.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:23-54:5:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:​23</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>The unleavened bread and red wine served at the Memorial are emblems, or symbols, of Christ’s flesh and blood.

<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  If Jesus had commanded his disciples to drink his blood, he would have been telling them to break God’s law against consuming blood.

<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  If the apostles had been literally drinking Jesus’ blood, he would not have said that his blood <em>“is to be</em> poured out,” indicating that his sacrifice was yet to occur.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:28-40:26:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 26:28</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  Jesus’ sacrifice took place “once for all time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:25-58:9:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:​25, 26</a>) However, if the bread and wine were changed into his flesh and blood during the Lord’s Evening Meal, then those partaking would be repeating that sacrifice.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>Those who believe in transubstantiation, that the bread and wine become Jesus’ literal body and blood, base this doctrine on the wording of certain Bible verses. For example, in many Bible translations, Jesus is recorded as saying of the wine: “This <em>is</em> my blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:28-40:26:28" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 26:28</a>) However, Jesus’ words can also be translated as: “This <em>means</em> my blood,” “This <em>represents</em> my blood,” or “This <em>signifies</em> my blood.”<span data-fnid="6" class="fn">f<span id="footnotesource6" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="6"></span></span> As he had often done, Jesus was teaching by using a metaphor.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:34-40:13:35" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 13:34, 35</a>.</p>
