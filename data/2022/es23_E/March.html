At the same time, we recognize that it is God who makes the seed grow. What a privilege we have both to preach and to teach the truth to others! This work makes us genuinely happy. The apostle Paul, who helped many in Thessalonica to become disciples, expressed his feelings this way: “What is our hope or joy or crown of exultation before our Lord Jesus at his presence?

Jehovah cares deeply about you, and he also cares about all your Christian brothers and sisters. To illustrate this point, Jesus compared Jehovah to a shepherd. If 1 sheep out of 100 strays from the flock, what will the shepherd do? He will “leave the 99 on the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying.” When the shepherd finds the sheep, he will not scold it for straying. He will rejoice. The point? Every sheep is important to Jehovah.

<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">Your faith will grow stronger as you meditate on what Jehovah has already done for his people and on what he has done for you personally. Most important, though, your love for Jehovah will deepen. Love, more than any other quality, will motivate you to obey Jehovah, to make sacrifices in order to please him, and to endure any trial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37-39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="97-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:7-46:13:7" data-bid="97-3" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="97-4" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>) Nothing could be more precious than a close, loving friendship with Jehovah! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:63:1-19:63:7" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Ps. 63:1-7</a>) Remember that prayer, study, and meditation are acts of worship. Like Jesus, seek out quiet settings in which to spend time with Jehovah. Eliminate unnecessary distractions. Ask Jehovah to help you focus when you are engaged in spiritual activities. If you make the best use of your time now, Jehovah will reward you with life forever in God’s new world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:24-41:4:24" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Mark 4:24</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="101" href="jwpub://p/E:2022246/26-28"><em>w22.01</em> 31 ¶18-20</a></p>

How important it is, then, that we immediately reject any bad thoughts that come to our mind! Jesus said: “Whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:18-40:15:18" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Matt. 15:18</a>) Yes, our speech reveals a lot about who we are on the inside. So ask yourself: ‘Do I refuse to lie, even if telling the truth will cause me trouble? As a married person, am I careful not to flirt with those of the opposite sex? Do I avoid immoral speech like the plague? Do I reply in a calm manner when someone upsets me?’ You will find it helpful to reflect on those questions. If you try your best to remove abusive, lying, and immoral speech from your conversation, you will find it easier to strip off the old personality. <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:2022320/19-21"><em>w22.03</em> 5 ¶12-14</a></p>

So take the initiative by asking for counsel. When might we ask for counsel from fellow believers? Consider some situations. (1) A sister asks an experienced publisher to join her on a study and later asks for advice on how she can improve her teaching methods. (2) A single sister would like to purchase a pair of slacks, so she asks a mature sister for her honest opinion about the selection. (3) A brother is assigned to give his first public talk. He asks an experienced speaker to listen carefully to his talk and offer him some constructive counsel on how he can improve. Even a brother who has given talks for many years does well to ask for such feedback from experienced speakers and then to apply the counsel he receives.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:20-20:19:20" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Prov. 19:20</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="103" href="jwpub://p/E:2022281/24-26"><em>w22.02</em> 13 ¶15-17</a></p>
