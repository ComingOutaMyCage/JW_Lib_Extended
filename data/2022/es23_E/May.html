<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To help us come to know his Son, Jehovah lovingly included the four Gospels in his Word. The Gospels contain a historical account of the life and ministry of Jesus. That account tells us what Jesus said, shows us what he did, and reveals to us how he felt. These four books help us to “consider closely” the example of Jesus. In effect, they contain the footsteps that Jesus left behind. So by examining the Gospels, we can come to know Jesus better and better. As a result, we can follow his steps closely. To benefit fully from the Gospels, we must do more than just read them. We need to take the time to study them carefully and meditate on them deeply. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8</a>, footnote.) Bring the Gospel accounts to life. Use your imagination to see, hear, and feel what was happening.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>) A sister named Sachiko says: “My mother wanted me to get 100 percent on my exams, which I found impossible. Although I left school years ago, at times I still wonder if my best is good enough for Jehovah.” King David said that he did not “aspire to things too great” or to things that were beyond him. His humility and modesty “calmed and quieted” him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:131:2-19:131:2" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ps. 131:2</a>) What can parents learn from David’s words? Parents can be humble and modest not only in what they expect of themselves but also in what they expect of their child. Parents can reassure their child by acknowledging his strengths and weaknesses when helping him to set appropriate goals. <a class="xt" data-xtid="160" href="jwpub://p/E:2021487/11-12"><em>w21.07</em> 21-22 ¶5-6</a></p>

Some young ones whose upbringing was far from ideal choose to serve Jehovah, and they make a success of their service. Others whose parents did their very best to bring them up in harmony with Scriptural principles turn their back on the truth once they get older. In the final analysis, we must personally decide whether we will serve Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:15-6:24:15" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Josh. 24:15</a>) So, grieving parents, fight the tendency to think that this tragedy must be your fault!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:10-19:27:10" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ps. 27:10</a>) This can be devastating for children who had looked up to the parent as a role model. Young ones, if one of your parents has been disfellowshipped, be assured that Jehovah is also keenly aware of your pain. He loves you and appreciates your loyalty. Remember, too, that you are not responsible for your parent’s decisions. <a class="xt" data-xtid="161" href="jwpub://p/E:2021565/11-13"><em>w21.09</em> 27 ¶5-7</a></p>

So it is necessary in some cases to isolate a spiritually sick individual from the congregation. This discipline is an expression of Jehovah’s love for faithful members of His flock, and it may reach the wrongdoer’s heart and lead him to repentance. While disfellowshipped, the individual may be able to attend meetings, where he can be fed and built up spiritually. He is also free to receive literature for his personal use and to watch JW Broadcasting<sup>®</sup>.

True, Jehovah did allow his servants in the past to express their concerns about decisions he had made or was about to make. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:25-1:18:25" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Gen. 18:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:2-32:4:3" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> Jonah 4:2, 3</a>) And occasionally, he explained his decision. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:10-32:4:11" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Jonah 4:10, 11</a>) Nevertheless, Jehovah does not need our approval, either before or after he acts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:13-23:40:14" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Isa. 40:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:9-23:55:9" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 55:9</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="174" href="jwpub://p/E:2022280/11-12"><em>w22.02</em> 3-4 ¶5-6</a></p>

All our brothers and sisters are superior to us in one way or another. It is not hard to see this when we focus on their positive qualities. We should take to heart the counsel that the apostle Paul gave to the Corinthians: “Who makes you different from another? Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive? If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:7-46:4:7" data-bid="99-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:7</a>) We should beware of any temptation to draw attention to ourselves or to think of ourselves as superior to others.

Some publishers live in areas where there are many high-security apartment buildings or gated communities. There may be a security guard who denies entry to anyone who does not have an invitation from a specific householder. Other publishers find few people at home or have territories where few people live. The publishers may cover great distances just to try to contact one householder​—who may not even be at home! If we face these types of challenges, we must not give up. Try reaching people at a different time. We will contact more people if we preach when they are likely to be at home. After all, everyone returns home sometime! Many brothers and sisters find it practical to preach in the afternoon or in the evening because they find more people. In addition, householders may be more relaxed and ready to talk during those times. <a class="xt" data-xtid="176" href="jwpub://p/E:2021404/11-11"><em>w21.05</em> 15 ¶5,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="177" href="jwpub://p/E:2021404/13-13"> 7</a></p>

Others become angry when Jehovah’s Witnesses do not join nationalistic celebrations or do not follow funeral customs that are out of harmony with God’s Word. Those who are stumbled in this way may sincerely believe that they are worshipping God acceptably. But they cannot please him if they prefer the world’s traditions to the clear teachings found in the Bible.

James wrote: “Everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.” An elder may assume that he has all the facts, but does he really? <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="116-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:13</a> reminds us: “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.” It is best to get the facts directly from the person himself. That involves listening before speaking. The elder might ask: “What has been happening in your life?” “How can I help?” If elders take the time to get the facts, they are more likely to help and encourage their brothers and sisters. Giving effective counsel involves more than simply reading a few scriptures or offering a suggestion or two. Our brothers and sisters need to sense that we care for them, that we understand them, and that we want to help them. <a class="xt" data-xtid="181" href="jwpub://p/E:2022284/23-24"><em>w22.02</em> 17 ¶14-15</a></p>
