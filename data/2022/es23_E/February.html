For example, a sister may have a serious health problem. She never complains about it, but she would likely appreciate some practical help. Would she welcome a little assistance with preparing meals or cleaning the house? A brother may have lost his job. Would a modest monetary gift, perhaps given anonymously, help tide him over until he finds another job? We should not wait until our brothers and sisters ask for our help before we show compassion. Like Jehovah, we can take the initiative. He makes the sun rise on us daily without our even asking for it! And the warmth of the sun sustains everyone, not just those who are thankful. Would you not agree that by providing for our needs, Jehovah is expressing his love for us? How we love Jehovah for being so kind and generous! <a class="xt" data-xtid="53" href="jwpub://p/E:2021564/19-20"><em>w21.09</em> 22-23 ¶12-13</a></p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">God’s loyal love moves him to be forgiving. When Jehovah observes a sinner who is repentant and who rejects his sinful course, loyal love moves Him to be forgiving. The psalmist David stated about Jehovah: “He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor has he repaid us what our errors deserve.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:8-19:103:11" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 103:8-11</a>) David himself knew from painful experience how heavy the burden of a guilty conscience can be. But he also learned that Jehovah is “ready to forgive.” What moves Jehovah to be forgiving? The answer is recorded in today’s text. Yes, as David said in prayer, Jehovah forgives because he abounds in loyal love for all those who call on him. When we sin, it is appropriate​—even healthy—​to feel remorse. It can move us to repent and take steps to correct our mistakes. <a class="xt" data-xtid="54" href="jwpub://p/E:2021645/19-20"><em>w21.11</em> 5 ¶11-12</a></p>

He could not hear what was being said about him, so he would not be in a position to defend himself. Furthermore, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:14-3:19:14" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:14</a> we learn that God’s servants were not to “put an obstacle before a blind man.” One reference work comments regarding people with physical challenges: “In the ancient Near East [they] tended to be exploited and abused.” Perhaps some inconsiderate person would place an obstacle before a blind man out of spite or out of some perverted sense of humor.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:20-20:4:22" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Prov. 4:20-22</a>) When he counsels us by means of his Word, a Bible-based publication, or a mature fellow believer, he is expressing his love for us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:9-58:12:10" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Heb. 12:9, 10</a>) Focus on the content, not the delivery. At times, we may feel that the counsel was not given in the best manner. Of course, anyone giving counsel should try to make it as easy as possible to accept. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1</a>) But if we are the one being counseled, we do well to focus on the message​—even if we feel that it could have been delivered in a better way. We might ask ourselves: ‘Even if I do not appreciate the manner in which the counsel was given, is there some truth to what was said? Can I look past the imperfections of the messenger and benefit from the message itself?’ It would be wise on our part to find a way to benefit from any counsel we receive. <a class="xt" data-xtid="68" href="jwpub://p/E:2022281/21-22"><em>w22.02</em> 12 ¶13-14</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:13-19:103:14" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14</a>) However, through his Word, his spirit, and his organization, Jehovah gives us the wisdom, strength, and support that we need to change who we are. Use the Bible to examine yourself closely. God’s Word acts like a mirror; it can help you to analyze the way that you think, speak, and act. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:22-59:1:25" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Jas. 1:22-25</a>) And Jehovah is always ready to come to your aid. He knows best how to help you; he knows what is in your heart.

Be convinced that Jehovah’s standards are best. We can benefit from everything that Jehovah asks us to do. Those who live by his standards gain self-respect, a purpose in life, and genuine happiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:8-19:19:11" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Ps. 19:8-11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="69" href="jwpub://p/E:2022320/15-17"><em>w22.03</em> 4 ¶8-10</a></p>

The Bible says that the work of making the tabernacle and its furnishings was “holy work.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:1-2:36:1" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Ex. 36:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:4-2:36:4" data-bid="110-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Today, too, Jehovah views the work of constructing Kingdom Halls and other theocratic facilities as sacred service. Some brothers and sisters spend much time engaging in these activities. Do we not appreciate this vital contribution to the Kingdom work? Of course, they also engage in the preaching work. Some of them may even want to be pioneers. Congregation elders can show their support for the construction activities by not hesitating to appoint these hardworking men and women as pioneers when they qualify. Whether we are skilled in construction work or not, all of us can share in keeping the buildings clean and in good repair. <a class="xt" data-xtid="70" href="jwpub://p/E:2022325/18-19"><em>w22.03</em> 22 ¶11-12</a></p>
