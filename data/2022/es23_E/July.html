Any negative comments about the way a disciplinary matter was handled have likely been initiated by someone who did not mention details that would put the wrongdoer in a bad light. We simply do not have all the facts. It is wise, then, to trust that the elders who took judicial action made every effort to follow Scriptural principles and to judge “for Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:19:6-14:19:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:6</a>) By supporting the elders’ decision to disfellowship your loved one, you may actually help him to return to Jehovah. “Severing family association with our adult son was extremely difficult,” admits Elizabeth. “But after he returned to Jehovah, he admitted that he deserved to be disfellowshipped.

The apostle Paul shared his preaching and teaching methods with Timothy, and he encouraged Timothy to use those methods to help others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:17-46:4:17" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:17</a>) Like Timothy, we can benefit from experienced ones in our congregation. Also, we should pray to Jehovah for help. Look to Jehovah for guidance every time you share in the ministry. Without the help of his powerful holy spirit, none of us would be able to accomplish anything. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:1-19:127:1" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps. 127:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Luke 11:13</a>) When you ask for Jehovah’s help in prayer, be specific. For example, ask him to direct you to anyone who may be rightly disposed and ready to listen. We should also make time for personal study. God’s Word says: “Prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) The more convinced we are that we know the truth about God, the greater will be our conviction when we talk to others in the ministry. <a class="xt" data-xtid="237" href="jwpub://p/E:2021404/21-23"><em>w21.05</em> 18 ¶14-16</a></p>

Jehovah looks at our efforts and endurance. In Jehovah’s eyes, our work for him is successful when we carry it out with diligence and love, regardless of how others respond.

Jesus’ understanding attitude is reflected in the parable of the talents. In that illustration, the master assigned each slave work “according to his own ability.” One of the two diligent slaves gained more than the other. But the master commended both with the same words: “Well done, good and faithful slave!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:14-40:25:23" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matt. 25:14-23</a>) Jesus is kind and loving in the way he deals with us.

Thanks to quick action on the part of Nabal’s long-suffering wife, Abigail, David avoided incurring bloodguilt.

And later, David was ready to judge the man in Nathan’s illustration as worthy of death. In this second instance, we might wonder why a normally warmhearted man would pronounce such a harsh judgment. Consider the context. At the time, David had a guilty conscience. A harsh, judgmental spirit is not a sign of good spiritual health.

Doing so can reinforce your faith that a loving, wise Creator made us and that he inspired the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:14" data-bid="88-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 1:21</a>) When studying God’s Word, note how helpful its counsel is. For example, the Bible long ago warned that the love of money is harmful and that it produces “many pains.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:9-54:6:10" data-bid="89-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:20-20:28:20" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> Prov. 28:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="89-3" class="b"> Matt. 6:24</a>) How helpful, then, is the Bible’s warning against developing a love of money! Can you think of additional Bible principles that have proved to be beneficial? The more we appreciate the Bible’s counsel, the more we will rely on the timeless wisdom provided by our loving Creator. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5</a>) As a result, our life will be more enjoyable.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Isa. 48:17, 18</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="253" href="jwpub://p/E:2021524/19-20"><em>w21.08</em> 17-18 ¶12-13</a></p>

You have endured trials​—even heartbreaking ones—​upheld the Bible’s righteous standards, carried heavy loads of responsibility, and trained others. You have done your best to keep pace with Jehovah’s fast-moving organization. You have supported and encouraged others as they pursued the full-time ministry. Jehovah God loves you very much for being loyal. He promises that “he will not abandon his loyal ones”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Ps. 37:28</a>) He gives you this assurance: “Until your hair is gray I will keep bearing you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:4-23:46:4" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Isa. 46:4</a>) So do not conclude that in view of your advancing years, you no longer have an important role in Jehovah’s organization.

The Bible says that “the wisdom from above” is “full of mercy and good fruits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Jas. 3:17</a>) Like a loving parent, Jehovah knows that his mercy benefits his children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:15-23:49:15" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Isa. 49:15</a>) Divine mercy gives them hope despite their imperfections. So Jehovah’s infinite wisdom moves him to extend mercy whenever he sees any basis for doing so. At the same time, Jehovah’s mercy is perfectly balanced. Wisely, he never crosses the line from mercy to permissiveness. Suppose that a servant of God deliberately sets out to follow a course of sin. What then? “Stop keeping company with” him, Paul wrote under inspiration. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:11" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:11</a>) Unrepentant wrongdoers are disfellowshipped from the congregation. That action is necessary in order to protect our faithful brothers and sisters and to reflect Jehovah’s holy ways. <a class="xt" data-xtid="254" href="jwpub://p/E:2021601/13-14"><em>w21.10</em> 9-10 ¶7-8</a></p>

Thus they expressed their appreciation for all the arrangements that had been made to benefit them spiritually. How can we express our love for Jehovah and our appreciation for the spiritual provisions we receive? One way is by giving financial support to the local congregation and to the worldwide work as our circumstances allow. The apostle Paul put it this way: “If the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what a person does not have.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:4-47:8:4" data-bid="101-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:12-47:8:12" data-bid="101-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Jehovah values any heartfelt donation we make, no matter how modest the amount.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:42-41:12:44" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Mark 12:42-44</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="255" href="jwpub://p/E:2022325/20-20"><em>w22.03</em> 24 ¶13</a></p>
