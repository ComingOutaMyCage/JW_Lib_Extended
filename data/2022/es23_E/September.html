The moment when the son realized how far he had fallen was important. He had to take action! The lost son demonstrated sincere repentance for what he had done. This parable is not just a heartwarming story. The principles it teaches can help congregation elders to discern whether a fellow believer has repented of his serious wrongdoing. <a class="xt" data-xtid="306" href="jwpub://p/E:2021600/22-23"><em>w21.10</em> 5 ¶14-15</a></p>

Sometimes, making the best use of our time involves choosing between two activities that are not wrong in themselves. The well-known account about Jesus’ visit to the home of Mary and Martha illustrates the point. No doubt thrilled to receive Jesus as her guest, hospitable Martha set about preparing an elaborate meal. Meanwhile, her sister, Mary, took advantage of the visit to sit close to her Lord and listen to his teaching. While Martha was certainly motivated by the best of intentions, Mary “chose the best portion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:38-42:10:42" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Luke 10:38-42</a>, ftn.)

Clearly, although Ahab had shown a degree of regret, he never fully repented. What can we learn from Ahab’s example? When he heard Elijah’s message of calamity against his family line, Ahab initially humbled himself. That was a good start. But his later actions showed that he was not repentant at heart.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">All of us need counsel from time to time. In some cases, we may take the initiative to ask someone we respect for advice. In other cases, a concerned brother may approach us and point out that we are about to take “a false step”​—one that we will regret. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1</a>) Finally, counsel may come to us in the form of correction after we have made a serious mistake. Whatever form it takes, we should listen to counsel. Doing so is good for us and could save our life! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:23-20:6:23" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Prov. 6:23</a>) Our day’s text encourages us to “listen to the words of the wise.” No human knows everything; there is always someone who has greater knowledge or experience than we do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:15-20:12:15" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Prov. 12:15</a>) So listening to counsel is a sign of humility. It indicates that we are aware of our limitations; we realize that we need help to reach our goals. Wise King Solomon wrote: “There is accomplishment through many advisers [or “counselors,” ftn.].”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:22-20:15:22" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Prov. 15:22</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="323" href="jwpub://p/E:2022281/6-7"><em>w22.02</em> 8 ¶1-2</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">True repentance involves more than saying we are sorry that we have pursued a sinful course. It also involves a genuine change of mind and heart. This includes abandoning a wrong course and turning around to walk in Jehovah’s ways again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:14-26:33:16" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ezek. 33:14-16</a>) A sinner’s primary concern should be to repair his damaged relationship with Jehovah. What should we do if we learn that a close friend of ours has committed a serious sin? We would only harm our friend by trying to cover up his sin. Such efforts never succeed anyway because Jehovah is watching. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:21-20:5:22" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Prov. 5:21, 22</a>) You can help your friend by reminding him that the elders want to help. If your friend refuses to confess to the elders, you should inform the elders about the matter, thereby showing that you truly want to help him. <a class="xt" data-xtid="324" href="jwpub://p/E:2021600/27-30"><em>w21.10</em> 7 ¶19-21</a></p>

The Bible says that he “took a slave’s form.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:7-50:2:7" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Phil. 2:7</a>) A valued slave, or servant, would look for opportunities to please his master. As a slave of Jehovah and a servant to your brothers, no doubt you desire to become even more useful to Jehovah and to your fellow believers. Ask yourself: ‘How willing am I to make personal sacrifices to help others? Am I quick to offer my help when there is a need for volunteers to clean a convention site or to maintain the Kingdom Hall?’ Suppose you discern that you need to improve in some aspect, but you lack the motivation to make the necessary changes. In that case, turn to Jehovah in earnest prayer. Tell Jehovah how you feel, and ask him to give you “both the desire and the power to act.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:13-50:2:13" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Phil. 2:13</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="325" href="jwpub://p/E:2022285/16-18"><em>w22.02</em> 22-23 ¶9-11</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:29-40:11:30" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29, 30</a>) For instance, when a Phoenician woman begged him to heal her child, he declined her request at first, but when she showed great faith, he kindly healed her child. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:22-40:15:28" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Matt. 15:22-28</a>) Although he was kind, Jesus was not overly sentimental. Sometimes he showed kindness by being firm with those he loved. For instance, when Peter tried to discourage Jesus from doing Jehovah’s will, Jesus rebuked him in front of the other disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:32-41:8:33" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Mark 8:32, 33</a>) He did this, not to humiliate Peter, but to train him and to warn the other disciples not to be presumptuous. No doubt Peter felt some embarrassment, but he benefited from the discipline. To be genuinely kind to those you love, at times you may have to speak frankly to them. When you do so, imitate Jesus by basing your counsel on principles found in God’s Word. <a class="xt" data-xtid="326" href="jwpub://p/E:2022321/19-20"><em>w22.03</em> 11 ¶12-13</a></p>

Praise springs from a grateful heart. By taking the time to meditate on Jehovah’s goodness​—on all the things he has done for us—​we will never run out of reasons to praise him. The preaching work gives us an especially fine opportunity to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of our lips.” Just as we should give careful thought to what we are going to say before approaching Jehovah in prayer, we do well to think carefully about what we will say to those we come in contact with in our ministry. We want our “sacrifice of praise” to be our very best. We speak from our heart when we share the truth with others. <a class="xt" data-xtid="327" href="jwpub://p/E:2022325/15-15"><em>w22.03</em> 21 ¶8</a></p>
