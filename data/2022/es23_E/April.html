Today, we can avoid being stumbled by learning the facts. In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus warned his listeners that some would “lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against” them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:11-40:5:11" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Matt. 5:11</a>) The source of these lies is Satan. He influences opposers to spread malicious slander about those who love the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:10" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9, 10</a>) We must reject the lies told by our opponents.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:6" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Heb. 12:5, 6</a>) Consider an illustration. A shepherd notices that one of his sheep is ailing.

They long to be with the flock, and they may become agitated when kept apart. Does this mean, though, that the shepherd is being harsh or cruel in choosing this treatment? Of course not. He knows that if he allows the sick sheep to mingle with the rest of the flock, the illness will spread. By isolating the sick one, he protects the whole flock. <a class="xt" data-xtid="132" href="jwpub://p/E:2021601/16-17"><em>w21.10</em> 10 ¶9-10</a></p>

With this in mind, we should be careful never to do anything that would reflect badly on Jehovah’s people or on our heavenly Father. We try to conduct ourselves in a way that will attract people to the good news. At times, some may belittle us or even persecute us because we obey our heavenly Father. What if we feel intimidated when speaking to others about our beliefs? We can count on Jehovah and his Son to come to our aid. Jesus reassured his disciples that they did not have to worry about how to speak or what to say. Why not? “What you are to speak will be given you in that hour,” explained Jesus, “for the ones speaking are not just you, but it is the spirit of your Father that speaks by you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:19-40:10:20" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Matt. 10:19, 20</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="133" href="jwpub://p/E:2021564/25-26"><em>w21.09</em> 24 ¶17-18</a></p>

Moreover, toward the end of his life, Moses called attention to a heartwarming detail.

When Jehovah is our Refuge, we feel secure. Still, there may be days when we are down and struggle to get up. At such times, what will Jehovah do for us? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:23-19:136:23" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Ps. 136:23</a>) He will put his arms beneath us, gently lift us up, and help us to get back on our feet.

Jesus told the story of a widow who kept crying out to an unrighteous judge for justice. She was confident that her persistence would pay off. Eventually, the judge responded to her pleas. The application? Jehovah is not unjust. So Jesus said: “Certainly, then, will not God cause justice to be done for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:1-42:18:8" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Luke 18:1-8</a>) Then Jesus added: “When the Son of man arrives, will he really find this faith on the earth?” When we suffer injustice, we need to prove by our patience and perseverance that we have strong faith like that of the widow. With such faith, we can be confident that sooner or later Jehovah will act in our behalf. We also need to believe in the power of prayer. <a class="xt" data-xtid="135" href="jwpub://p/E:2021641/20-20"><em>w21.11</em> 23 ¶12;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="136" href="jwpub://p/E:2021641/22-22"> 24 ¶14</a></p>

So when a person agrees to study the Bible with us, we face the challenge of helping him to build trust in Jehovah and trust in His earthly representatives. Of course, Bible students are not the only ones who need to learn to trust in Jehovah and to trust in his organization.
