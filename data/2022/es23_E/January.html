For example, he exposed the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, who were more concerned with how they washed their hands than with how they cared for their parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:1-40:15:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 15:1-11</a>) Jesus did not allow the negative reaction of the religious leaders to stop him from speaking the truth. Jesus also exposed false religious teachings. He did not say that all religious beliefs are acceptable to God. Rather, he spoke of many who would be on the spacious road that leads to destruction, whereas only a few would be on the cramped road to life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 7:13, 14</a>) He made it clear that some would appear to serve God, but in reality they were not serving him. He warned: “Be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheep’s covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will recognize them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:15-40:7:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 7:15-20</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:2021401/14-15"><em>w21.05</em> 9 ¶7-8</a></p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">Jehovah loves to be merciful. The apostle Paul was inspired to write that God is “rich in mercy.” In this context, Paul was referring to God’s mercy in offering the hope of heavenly life to his imperfect, anointed servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:4-49:2:7" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Eph. 2:4-7</a>) But Jehovah’s mercy is even more extensive than that. The psalmist David wrote: “Jehovah is good to all, and his mercy is evident in all his works.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:9-19:145:9" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps. 145:9</a>) Because Jehovah loves people, he extends mercy whenever he sees a basis for doing so. More than anyone else, Jesus knows how much Jehovah loves to show mercy. This Father and Son were together in heaven during the course of thousands of years of human history. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:31" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Prov. 8:30, 31</a>) On many occasions, Jesus saw how his Father showed mercy to sinful humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:37-19:78:42" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ps. 78:37-42</a>) In his teaching, Jesus often highlighted this endearing quality of his Father. <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:2021601/10-11"><em>w21.10</em> 8-9 ¶4-5</a></p>

In the first century C.E., shortly after the Christian congregation was established, Jehovah “turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:14-44:15:14" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Acts 15:14</a>) Those first-century Christians were proud to use God’s name and to make it known to others. They used the divine name prominently in their ministry and in their writings. They proved themselves to be a people for God’s name.

In the opening verse, we read: “Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:1-19:136:1" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Ps. 136:1</a>) In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:2-19:136:26" data-bid="56-1" class="b">verses 2 to 26</a>, we find the refrain “for his loyal love endures forever.” As we read the remaining verses of this psalm, we cannot help but be impressed by the many ways in which Jehovah shows his loyal love without letup. The refrain “for his loyal love endures forever” assures us that God’s love for his people is not fickle. How heartening it is to know that Jehovah does not quickly give up on his servants! Instead, he attaches himself to those who serve him and he sticks with them, especially in times of distress. Knowing that Jehovah sticks with us gives us the joy and the strength we need to cope with our distresses and to keep walking on the path to life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:7-19:31:7" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 31:7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:2021645/16-18"><em>w21.11</em> 4 ¶9-10</a></p>

Do you ever ask yourself, ‘When the time comes, will I be able to pass through these fear-inspiring events with my integrity intact?’ If such thoughts have crossed your mind, Jesus’ words, as recorded in today’s text, should prove to be most helpful. Jesus told his disciples: “Do not let your hearts be troubled. Exercise faith.” Strong faith will help us to face the future with confidence. We can strengthen our faith to endure future trials by considering how we deal with tests of faith now. Then we can learn of areas where we need to strengthen our faith. With each test we pass, our faith becomes stronger. This will help us to endure future trials. <a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:2021641/6-7"><em>w21.11</em> 20 ¶1-2</a></p>

Think, for example, of our brothers who live in lands where our work is restricted or even banned. Jehovah’s people must deal with a variety of problems that could dishearten them. For instance, many have to work long hours just to provide the basic necessities for their family. They would like to do more in the ministry, but they have little energy at the end of the week. Others are severely limited in what they can do because of chronic illness or advancing age; they may even be confined to their home. Still others are constantly plagued by feelings of worthlessness. Regardless of our circumstances, Jehovah can empower us to cope with personal challenges and still serve him to the extent that our circumstances allow. <a class="xt" data-xtid="20" href="jwpub://p/E:2021405/6-8"><em>w21.05</em> 20 ¶1-3</a></p>

Today, we do not object to garments of mixed materials, such as cotton and polyester or wool and rayon. But we do object to being like people whose beliefs and practices conflict with Bible teachings. Of course, we have natural affection for our relatives, and we show love for our neighbors.

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Jehovah was training Jesus for his future role as our High Priest. Jesus experienced how difficult it is to obey God when under extreme test. He felt so much pressure that he prayed for help “with strong outcries and tears.” Certainly, having gone through wrenching emotional distress, Jesus himself understands our needs and “is able to come to [our] aid” when we “are being put to the test.” How grateful we are to Jehovah for appointing over us a merciful High Priest who can “sympathize with our weaknesses”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:17-58:2:17" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Heb. 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:14-58:4:16" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> 4:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:7-58:5:10" data-bid="94-3" class="b"> 5:7-10</a>) Jehovah allowed Jesus to suffer so severely in order to answer an important question: Can humans demonstrate godly devotion even when severely tested? Satan says no! He claims that humans serve God for selfish reasons and that they are not devoted to Jehovah.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:23-41:10:23" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Mark 10:23</a>) Yet, Jesus told the man to make this big change in his lifestyle. Why? Because Jesus felt love for him. At times, we may hold back from encouraging a student to apply what he is learning because we feel that he is not ready to make a needed change.

As imperfect humans, can we really follow Jesus’ example? Yes, we can. Recall that Peter urges us “to follow [Jesus’] steps closely”​—not perfectly. If we follow his footsteps carefully, doing the best we can as imperfect humans, we will be heeding the apostle John’s words: “Go on walking just as that one [Jesus] walked.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:6-62:2:6" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 John 2:6</a>) Following Jesus’ footsteps will draw us closer to Jehovah.

During that study, you came to love Jehovah and you learned that he loves you. Jehovah drew you to the truth, and now, as a disciple of Jesus Christ, you have the prospect of living forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="115-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) You are no doubt grateful to Jehovah that He motivated someone to teach you the truth and that He accepted you as one of His servants.
