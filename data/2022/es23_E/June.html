Yet, she goes to one of the chests and discreetly puts in two small coins, which perhaps hardly make a sound as they are dropped into the chest. Jesus knows what she deposited​—two lepta coins, the smallest coins in circulation at the time. That is not even enough money to buy a single sparrow, among the cheapest birds sold for food. Jesus is deeply impressed by this widow. So he calls his disciples, draws their attention to the widow, and says: “This poor widow put in more than all the others.” Then he explains: “They [especially the rich people] all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her want, put in everything she had, all she had to live on.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:43-41:12:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 12:43, 44</a>) When this faithful widow gave her last bit of money that day, she was putting her life in Jehovah’s caring hands.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:3-19:26:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="182" href="jwpub://p/E:2021360/26-27"><em>w21.04</em> 6 ¶17-18</a></p>

Later, that same slave was unwilling to cancel the much smaller debt of his fellow slave. In the end, the king threw that merciless slave into prison. The slave’s actions harmed not only him but others too. First, he heartlessly harmed his fellow slave by having him “thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed.” Second, he hurt other slaves who observed what he had done. When his “fellow slaves saw what had happened, they became greatly distressed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:30-40:18:31" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 18:30, 31</a>) Similarly, our actions affect others.

Their self-condemning heart convinces them that Jehovah could never forgive them​—no matter how repentant they are. If you deal with such feelings, learning about God’s willingness to extend loyal love to his servants will help you to serve Jehovah joyfully with a clean conscience.

Note the connection that the psalmist David made between loyal love and forgiveness. He wrote: “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so great is his loyal love toward those who fear him. As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset, so far off from us he has put our transgressions.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:11-19:103:12" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 103:11, 12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="188" href="jwpub://p/E:2021645/20-21"><em>w21.11</em> 5-6 ¶12-13</a></p>

For example, a husband honors his wife by dignifying her. He does not ask more of her than she can give. And he certainly does not compare her with other women. If he were to do so, what effect might such a comparison have? The non-Witness husband of a sister named Rosa often compares her with other women. His cruel words have done more than undermine Rosa’s self-confidence. She says, “I need constant reassurance that Jehovah values me.” In contrast, a Christian husband assigns honor to his wife. He knows that his doing so affects both his relationship with her and his relationship with Jehovah. A husband who honors his wife praises her, reassures her of his love, and commends her. <a class="xt" data-xtid="189" href="jwpub://p/E:2021487/13-14"><em>w21.07</em> 22 ¶7-8</a></p>

Their examples feed my heart and mind with positive thoughts that soothe the pain.” When you experience distressing feelings, do not stop praying to Jehovah. Beg our loving God to help you view the situation from his perspective and to “give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:6-19:32:8" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps. 32:6-8</a>) Of course, it may be very painful to tell Jehovah how you really feel.

Paul told the elders: “Kindly forgive and comfort him.” Note Paul’s reason: “So that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sadness.” Paul felt pity for the repentant man. The apostle did not want to see the man so overwhelmed, so crushed, by what he did that he would give up on seeking forgiveness.

For example, when we open an envelope, we might get a slight paper cut on our finger. That can really hurt, but after a day or two, perhaps we do not even recall where the cut was. Similarly, some offenses are minor. For example, a friend may say or do something thoughtless that hurts us, but we are able to forgive him easily. But if we have a deeper wound, a doctor may have to stitch the wound and bind it in bandages. If we were to keep poking or picking at the wound, we would only harm ourselves. Sadly, a person might be doing something similar when he is deeply offended. He may constantly think about the emotional injury he suffered and the hurt the other person caused him. But those who hold a grudge hurt only themselves. How much better it is to obey the counsel found in today’s text. <a class="xt" data-xtid="203" href="jwpub://p/E:2021681/23-23"><em>w21.12</em> 12 ¶15</a></p>

The elder could ask himself, ‘Is there a Scriptural reason to say something?’ Conscious of the need to be objective, he might ask another elder or mature publisher for his thoughts. Together they might review Paul’s counsel on dress and grooming. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="56-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9, 10</a>) Paul outlined certain broad principles, observing that a Christian’s dress should be appropriate, modest, and sensible. But Paul did not make a list of dos and don’ts. He recognized that Christians have a right to express their individual taste within Scriptural limits. So the elders should consider if the person’s choices reflect modesty and good sense. We do well to realize that two mature Christians may make different choices, both of which are acceptable. We should not impose our own standards of right and wrong on fellow believers. <a class="xt" data-xtid="204" href="jwpub://p/E:2022284/16-17"><em>w22.02</em> 16 ¶9-10</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) To remain balanced, they may on occasion need to say no to some assignments. After prayerful consideration, they may realize that they could not care for an assignment without neglecting the more important things, such as conducting family worship, having a full share in the preaching work, or training their children in that activity. They can be sure that Jehovah understands their desire to be balanced in all things. <a class="xt" data-xtid="213" href="jwpub://p/E:2022326/10-10"><em>w22.03</em> 27 ¶4,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="214" href="jwpub://p/E:2022326/13-13"> 7;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="215" href="jwpub://p/E:2022326/14-14"> 28 ¶8</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Do you remember feeling a bit afraid of becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Perhaps you felt that you would never be able to preach publicly. Or maybe you feared that your family or friends might oppose you. If so, you can sympathize with your Bible student when he feels the same. Jesus acknowledged that such fears are possible. However, he urged his followers not to let fear stop them from serving Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:17" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Matt. 10:16, 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:27-40:10:27" data-bid="93-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Progressively train your Bible student to share his faith. Jesus’ disciples may have felt nervous when he sent them out to preach. But Jesus helped them by telling them where to preach and what their message was to be. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:5-40:10:7" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Matt. 10:5-7</a>) How can you imitate Jesus? Help your student to see where he can preach. For example, ask him if he knows someone who could benefit from learning a specific Bible truth. Then help him to prepare what to say by showing him a simple way to share that truth. <a class="xt" data-xtid="216" href="jwpub://p/E:2021440/23-24"><em>w21.06</em> 6 ¶15-16</a></p>

To me, it seemed like forever.” Those are the comments of some who survived an earthquake that struck Nepal in 2015. We are, however, at this very moment experiencing a different kind of shaking​—one that involves all the nations. The prophet Haggai wrote: “This is what Jehovah of armies says, ‘Yet once more​—in a little while—​and I will shake the heavens and the earth.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:6-37:2:6" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Hag. 2:6</a>) The shaking that Haggai describes is not like a literal earthquake, which brings only destruction. Instead, it produces good results. Jehovah himself tells us: “I will shake all the nations, and the precious things of all the nations will come in; and I will fill this house with glory.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="217" href="jwpub://p/E:2021562/6-8"><em>w21.09</em> 14 ¶1-3</a></p>
