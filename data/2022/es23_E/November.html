He can also help you to recall just the right scripture to share with an interested householder. And he gives you the strength to continue when you meet with indifference in the territory. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:20:7-24:20:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 20:7-9</a>) Jehovah has also shown us his goodness by training us for the ministry. At our midweek meeting, we listen to well-thought-out sample conversations, and we are encouraged to use them in the ministry. At first, we may be a bit apprehensive about trying something new, but when we do, we may find that the new approach appeals to those in our territory. We are also encouraged at meetings and conventions to engage in forms of the ministry that we might never have tried before. Once again, that will mean leaving our comfort zone, but when we do, we give Jehovah something to bless. <a class="xt" data-xtid="367" href="jwpub://p/E:2021526/10-11"><em>w21.08</em> 27 ¶5-6</a></p>

On the contrary, we will be happy for them. That is especially true if they are using their abilities in Jehovah’s service to his praise. As a result, we will all promote peace and unity in the congregation. We can control our tendency toward envy by cultivating modesty, that is, by being aware of our own limitations. If we are modest, we will not try to prove that we are more talented or more capable than everyone else. Instead, we will look at how we can learn from those who are more capable than we are. For example, suppose a brother in the congregation gives excellent public talks. We might ask him how he goes about preparing his talks. If a sister is a fine cook, we might ask her for suggestions that will help us to improve in that area. <a class="xt" data-xtid="381" href="jwpub://p/E:2021486/15-16"><em>w21.07</em> 16 ¶8-9</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Some early Christians were slow to apply counsel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:22-59:1:22" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Jas. 1:22</a>) Others showed partiality toward the rich. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:1-59:2:3" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Jas. 2:1-3</a>) Still others had a hard time controlling their tongue. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:8-59:3:10" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Jas. 3:8-10</a>) Those Christians had serious problems, but James did not give up on them. He presented his counsel in a kind but straightforward way and encouraged those who were struggling spiritually to seek additional help from the elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:13-59:5:14" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Jas. 5:13, 14</a>) The lesson: Be realistic, but keep a positive view of others. Many with whom we study the Bible may struggle to apply its counsel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:1-59:4:4" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Jas. 4:1-4</a>) It may take them some time to root out bad traits and replace them with Christlike qualities. We must have the courage to tell our students where they need to improve. We also need to remain positive, trusting that Jehovah will draw humble people to him and will give them the strength to make changes in their life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:10-59:4:10" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Jas. 4:10</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="395" href="jwpub://p/E:2022241/18-19"><em>w22.01</em> 11 ¶11-12</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">All Christians seek to imitate Jehovah’s mercy. Why? One reason is that Jehovah will not listen to those who fail to show mercy to others. None of us would want Jehovah to refuse to listen to our prayers, so we carefully avoid developing a hard-hearted spirit. Rather than turn a deaf ear to a fellow Christian in pain, we must always be ready to listen to “the cry of the lowly one.” Similarly, we take to heart this inspired counsel: “The one who does not practice mercy will have his judgment without mercy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:13-59:2:13" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Jas. 2:13</a>) If we humbly remember how much we need mercy, we are more likely to show mercy. We especially want to show mercy when a repentant wrongdoer returns to the congregation. Bible examples of those who were kind and merciful can help us to embrace mercy and to avoid harshness. <a class="xt" data-xtid="396" href="jwpub://p/E:2021601/24-25"><em>w21.10</em> 12 ¶16-17</a></p>

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">On the final night of his life on earth, as his ministry came to an end, Jesus sought out a quiet setting where he could meditate and pray. He found that setting in the garden of Gethsemane. On that occasion, Jesus gave his disciples some timely counsel about prayer. When they arrived at the garden of Gethsemane, it was very late, perhaps past midnight. Jesus asked the apostles to “keep on the watch,” and he went off to pray. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:37-40:26:39" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Matt. 26:37-39</a>) But while he was praying, they fell asleep. When he found them sleeping, Jesus again urged them to “keep on the watch and pray continually.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:40-40:26:41" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Matt. 26:40, 41</a>) He realized that they had been under much stress and that they were tired. Jesus compassionately acknowledged that “the flesh is weak.” Still, two more times Jesus went off to pray, and when he returned he found his disciples sleeping rather than praying.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:42-40:26:45" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Matt. 26:42-45</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="397" href="jwpub://p/E:2022246/17-18"><em>w22.01</em> 28 ¶10-11</a></p>
