(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:14-43:10:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 10:14</a>) That comparison is appropriate. The sheep know their shepherd and respond to his voice. A traveler experienced this firsthand. He reported: “We wanted to film some sheep and tried to make them come near. But they did not follow us because they did not know our voices. Then a small shepherd boy came along; hardly had he called them when they followed along.” The experience of that traveler reminds us of Jesus’ words regarding his sheep​—his disciples. He said: “They will listen to my voice.” But Jesus is in heaven. How can we say that we are listening to him? A key way we show that we are listening to our Master’s voice is by applying his teachings in our life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:24-40:7:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 7:24, 25</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="398" href="jwpub://p/E:2021686/6-7"><em>w21.12</em> 16 ¶1-2</a></p>

The men of Ephraim met Gideon, not to commend him, but to quarrel with him because they had not been asked to join the fight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:1-7:8:1" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Judg. 8:1</a>) Gideon gave them a specific example of how Jehovah had blessed them. As a result, the men “calmed down.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:3-7:8:3" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Judg. 8:3</a>) Gideon willingly set pride aside in order to maintain peace among God’s people. From the example of the Ephraimites, we learn that we should not become more focused on protecting our own honor than on honoring Jehovah. As family heads and elders, we can learn a lesson from Gideon. If someone is upset by something we did, we should try to see things from his perspective. We can also commend the person for what he has done well. That will require humility on our part. But peace is worth much more than our personal pride. <a class="xt" data-xtid="414" href="jwpub://p/E:2021486/18-20"><em>w21.07</em> 16-17 ¶10-12</a></p>

The lesson: Remember that we are all sinners. We must not think that we are somehow superior to those whom we teach. Why not? If we give our student the impression that we are flawless, he may conclude that he could never measure up to God’s requirements. But when we honestly admit that it has not always been easy for us to follow Scriptural principles and we explain how Jehovah has helped us to overcome our challenges, we will help our student to see that he too can serve Jehovah. <a class="xt" data-xtid="428" href="jwpub://p/E:2022241/20-21"><em>w22.01</em> 11-12 ¶13-14</a></p>

With its help, you can accomplish things that you could never do on your own. Third, Jehovah does not expect you to display the fruitage of the spirit perfectly now. In fact, our loving Father has set aside 1,000 years for those with an earthly hope to become perfect.

A study of God’s Word and attendance at congregation meetings can also help us to draw closer to God. Is there anything you can do to make the best use of study periods and the time you spend at congregation meetings? Ask yourself, ‘What tends to interfere with my concentration during the meetings or when I am trying to study?’ Could it be receiving calls, emails, or text messages on your smartphone or on some other electronic device? When you notice that your mind is wandering during a study period or a congregation meeting, ask Jehovah to help you focus. It may not be easy to set your concerns aside and focus on spiritual things, but it is essential that you do so. Pray for the peace that will guard not only your heart but also your “mental powers.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="430" href="jwpub://p/E:2022246/19-21"><em>w22.01</em> 29-30 ¶12-14</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">King Uzziah rejected counsel. He entered a section of Jehovah’s temple where only the priests were allowed to be, and he attempted to offer incense. The priests of Jehovah said to him: “It is not proper for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah! It is only the priests who should burn incense.” How did Uzziah react? If he had humbly accepted the counsel and left the temple immediately, Jehovah might have forgiven him. Instead, “Uzziah . . . became enraged.” Why did he reject the counsel? He evidently felt that as king, he had the right to do whatever he wanted. But Jehovah did not see it that way. As a result of his presumptuous act, Uzziah was struck with leprosy and “remained a leper until the day of his death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:21" data-bid="97-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:16-21</a>) Uzziah’s example teaches us that, no matter who we are, if we reject Bible-based counsel, we will lose Jehovah’s approval. <a class="xt" data-xtid="431" href="jwpub://p/E:2022281/13-13"><em>w22.02</em> 9 ¶7</a></p>

True, elders may from time to time need to adjust the thinking of a brother or a sister. But like the apostle Paul, elders should strive to look beyond a person’s irritating words and actions. Instead, they do well to focus on that individual’s love for Jehovah, his endurance in serving God, and his potential for doing good. Elders who have a positive view create a warm and nurturing environment in the congregation. Remember that Jehovah is not asking you to be perfect; he is asking you to be faithful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:2-46:4:2" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:2</a>) You can be sure that God also values what you do in his service.
