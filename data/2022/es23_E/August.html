(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:23-60:2:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:23</a>) Like Jesus, we need to be willing to forgive others.

They may lie about us, humiliate us in front of others, destroy our literature, or even threaten to cause us physical harm. Rather than harboring resentment, we can ask Jehovah to open the eyes of those who oppose us so that they may one day see the truth.

When a precious son or daughter leaves Jehovah, it is common for the parents to wonder what more they could have done to help their young one stay in the truth. One brother said: “I blamed myself.

That is what the Gospel writer Luke was determined to do. He made it a point to trace “all things from the start with accuracy.” He wanted his readers to “know fully the certainty of the things” they had heard about Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:1-42:1:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 1:1-4</a>) The Jewish people in ancient Beroea were like Luke.

David acknowledges that his life in Jehovah’s “grassy pastures” will not be trouble free. At times, he may get discouraged, as if walking “in the valley of deep shadow,” and he will have enemies. But with Jehovah as his Shepherd, David will “fear no harm.” In what way did David “lack nothing”? Spiritually speaking, he had everything he needed. His happiness was not dependent on material things. David was satisfied with what Jehovah provided. What mattered most to him was the blessing and the protection of his God.

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">In the agricultural society of Israel, hired laborers were to be paid at the end of each workday. To hold back the wages of such a worker would deprive him of the money he needed to feed his family that day. Jehovah explained: “He is in need and his life depends on his wages.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:14-5:24:15" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Deut. 24:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:8-40:20:8" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> Matt. 20:8</a>) Today many employees are paid once or twice a month, not every day. However, the principle set out at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:13-3:19:13" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:13</a> is still valid. Some employers take advantage of their employees by paying them an amount that is far below what is fair. They know that these workers may have little choice but to continue working for starvation wages. In a sense, such employers are ‘withholding the wages of a hired worker.’ A Christian who has a business would want to take this point to heart. <a class="xt" data-xtid="288" href="jwpub://p/E:2021681/16-17"><em>w21.12</em> 10 ¶9-10</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">After all that Jesus had suffered, he must have been very thirsty. He needed help to quench his thirst. Jesus did not consider it to be a sign of weakness to express how he felt; nor should we. For much of our life, we may have preferred not to tell others about our needs. But if the time comes when we need help, we should not hesitate to ask others for assistance. For example, if we are older or infirm, we may have to ask a friend to give us a ride to a grocery store or to a doctor’s appointment. If we are downhearted or discouraged, we may need to ask an elder or other mature Christian friend to provide a listening ear or to share “a good word” to cheer us up. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Prov. 12:25</a>) Let us remember that our brothers and sisters love us, and they want to help us in “times of distress.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Prov. 17:17</a>) But they cannot read our minds. They may not know that we need help unless we take the initiative to say something. <a class="xt" data-xtid="289" href="jwpub://p/E:2021361/21-22"><em>w21.04</em> 11-12 ¶11-12</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Change is challenging for many of us. Some who served in a form of special full-time service for a long time have received a change of assignment. Others have had to relinquish a cherished privilege because of their age. It is normal to feel disappointed when such a change affects us. We cope better with change when we look at things from Jehovah’s perspective. He is accomplishing great things today, and we have the unique privilege of being his fellow workers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="102-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:9</a>) Jehovah’s love for us will not change. Consequently, if a change in the organization affects you personally, avoid getting caught up in the whys and wherefores behind the change. Rather than long for “the former days,” prayerfully look for the good in the change. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:10-21:7:10" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:10</a>) Keep a positive attitude.

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">To whom does Jehovah show loyal love? The Bible mentions that we can love many things, such as “agriculture,” “wine and oil,” “discipline,” “knowledge,” “wisdom”​—to name a few. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:10-14:26:10" data-bid="105-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:1-20:12:1" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> Prov. 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:17-20:21:17" data-bid="105-3" class="b"> 21:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:3-20:29:3" data-bid="105-4" class="b"> 29:3</a>) Loyal love, however, is never extended to things or concepts; it is shown only to people. But Jehovah does not show loyal love to just anyone. He shows it to those who are in a special relationship with him. Our God is loyal to his friends. He has a wonderful purpose for them, and he will not give up on them. Jehovah has shown love to mankind in general. Jesus told a man named Nicodemus: “God loved the world [of mankind] so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:1-43:3:1" data-bid="106-1" class="b">John 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:44-40:5:45" data-bid="106-3" class="b"> Matt. 5:44, 45</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="291" href="jwpub://p/E:2021645/9-9"><em>w21.11</em> 2 ¶3;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="292" href="jwpub://p/E:2021645/13-14"> 3 ¶6-7</a></p>
