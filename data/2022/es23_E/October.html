<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God’s Word forms the basis for our teachings and beliefs. Even so, many today are stumbled because they think that our way of worship is too simple and that what we teach does not match what they want to hear. How can we avoid being stumbled? The apostle Paul told Christians living in Rome: “Faith follows the thing heard. In turn, what is heard is through the word about Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 10:17</a>) So we build up our faith by studying the Scriptures, not by participating in unscriptural religious ceremonies, no matter how pleasing to the eye these ceremonies might be. We must acquire strong faith based on accurate knowledge because “without faith it is impossible to please God well.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 11:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Thus, we do not need to see a spectacular sign from heaven to prove that we have found the truth. A careful examination of the Bible’s faith-strengthening teachings is enough to convince us and to dispel any doubt. <a class="xt" data-xtid="328" href="jwpub://p/E:2021400/18-19"><em>w21.05</em> 4-5 ¶11-12</a></p>

A Pharisee once asked Jesus: “Which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus replied that “the greatest and first commandment” is to love Jehovah with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole mind. Then Jesus quoted <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:18</a>, saying: “The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:35-40:22:40" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Matt. 22:35-40</a>) There are countless ways to show love for neighbor.

When Peter stepped out of the boat and onto the sea, he did not expect to get distracted and start sinking. He wanted to stay on top of the waters until he reached his Master. But he failed to remain focused on that goal. Granted, we cannot walk on water, but we do face tests of faith. If we lose sight of Jehovah and his promises, we will begin to sink spiritually.

Similarly, in fulfillment of the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:15-26:37:19" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Ezekiel 37:15-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:24-26:37:25" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> 24, 25</a>, Jehovah has brought the anointed and the other sheep together in an unbreakable bond of unity. The prophecy mentions two sticks. Those with the heavenly hope are like the stick “for Judah” (the tribe from which the kings of Israel were chosen), and those with the earthly hope are like the stick “of Ephraim.” Jehovah would unite the two groups so that they would become “one stick.” This means that they serve unitedly under their one King, Christ Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="89-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="360" href="jwpub://p/E:2022245/16-17"><em>w22.01</em> 22 ¶9-10</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Jesus spoke about those who gave alms to the poor but made sure that others knew about their gifts. Those seemingly good works were of little value to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:2-40:6:4" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Matt. 6:2-4</a>) We can be genuinely good only if we do the right thing for unselfish reasons. So you might ask yourself: ‘Do I not only know what is the right thing to do but also follow through and actually do it? What is my motive for doing good things?’ Jehovah is a God of action, and his spirit is an active force. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:2-1:1:2" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Gen. 1:2</a>) So every aspect of the fruitage of the spirit can and must move us to action. For example, the disciple James wrote: “Faith without works is dead.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:26-59:2:26" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Jas. 2:26</a>) The same could be said of all the other aspects of the fruitage of God’s spirit. Each time we display them, we give evidence that God’s spirit is active in us. <a class="xt" data-xtid="361" href="jwpub://p/E:2022321/21-24"><em>w22.03</em> 11-12 ¶14-16</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">While we may engage in various spiritual activities and do many good works, the apostle Peter highlighted one in particular. Leading up to his encouragement to become holy in all our conduct, Peter urges us: “Brace up your minds for activity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:13-60:1:13" data-bid="95-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:13</a>) What would that activity involve? Peter said that Christ’s anointed brothers would “‘declare abroad the excellencies’ of the One who called” them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="96-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:9</a>) In fact, all Christians today have the honor of doing this most important work, one that does the greatest amount of good. What a special privilege we have as a holy people to share regularly and zealously in the preaching and teaching work! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a>) When we diligently do this, we prove that we love our God and our neighbor. And we show that we want to “become holy” in all our conduct. <a class="xt" data-xtid="362" href="jwpub://p/E:2021681/27-27"><em>w21.12</em> 13 ¶18</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">The apostle Paul kept a positive view of his brothers and sisters. He knew the difference between bad conduct and bad people. He loved his brothers and focused on their good qualities. If they were struggling to do the right thing, he assumed that their motives were good and that they simply needed help. Consider how Paul dealt with two sisters in the congregation in Philippi. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:1-50:4:3" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Phil. 4:1-3</a>) Euodia and Syntyche seemed to have allowed personal differences to cause a rift between them. Paul was not harsh or judgmental; he focused on their good qualities. They were faithful sisters who had built up a fine record. Paul knew that Jehovah loved them. Paul’s positive view of these sisters motivated him to encourage them to resolve their differences. His outlook also allowed him to keep his joy and maintain strong friendships with those in that congregation. <a class="xt" data-xtid="363" href="jwpub://p/E:2022326/25-27"><em>w22.03</em> 30 ¶16-18</a></p>

She says: “I struggle with feelings of loneliness. At times, those feelings cause me to think that Jehovah does not love me. But when that happens, I immediately tell Jehovah how I feel. Prayer allows me to gain control of my feelings.” As her experience shows, we can find peace through prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) We know that Jehovah and Jesus will support us when we lose a loved one in death. We are motivated to preach and teach with compassion because Jehovah God and Jesus Christ show this tender quality. And we find comfort in knowing that Jehovah and his dear Son sympathize with our weaknesses and want to help us endure. We look forward to the day when Jehovah will “wipe out every tear from [our] eyes”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="364" href="jwpub://p/E:2022244/13-13"><em>w22.01</em> 15 ¶7;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="365" href="jwpub://p/E:2022244/27-28"> 19 ¶19-20</a></p>

<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="sb">Jesus mentioned two different gates leading to two different roads, a “spacious” road and a “cramped” road. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:14-40:7:14" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Matt. 7:14</a>) There is no third road. We must choose for ourselves on which road we will travel. This is the most important decision we will ever make​—our everlasting life depends on it. The “spacious” road is popular because it is easy to travel. Sadly, many choose to remain on that road and to follow the crowd traveling on it. They fail to recognize that the one promoting this road is Satan the Devil and that his road leads to a dead end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="105-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>) In contrast with the “spacious” road, the other road is “cramped,” and Jesus said that few are able to find it. Why?
