<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Gannets are large seabirds that plunge toward the ocean’s surface at speeds of up to 190 kilometers per hour (118 mph). When a gannet hits the water, the impact may exceed 20 times the force of gravity. How are gannets able to survive and repeat such formidable dives?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Consider:</strong> Before the gannet hits the water, it stretches its wings behind its body, making it streamlined like an arrow. It also draws a protective membrane over its eyes and inflates organs in its neck and chest that function as airbags to cushion the impact.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>As the gannet pierces the ocean’s surface, its beak, head, and neck form a cone. This shape evenly distributes the force of impact on the gannet’s sturdy neck muscles. In an instant, the gannet refocuses its eyes for underwater vision.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>How deep can the gannet dive? The bird’s momentum can take it to a depth of almost 11 meters (36 ft), but it can continue its descent by flapping its half-folded wings and kicking its webbed feet. Actually, gannets have been spotted diving to depths greater than 25 meters (82 ft) below the ocean surface. When finished diving, a gannet floats effortlessly to the surface, ready to fly again.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Researchers designed bionic gannets to assist in search-and-rescue operations. These robots were expected to fly, dive into the water, and become airborne again. However, during prototype trials, one robot broke several times as a result of hitting the water too violently. This led the researchers to conclude that their prototype was “not good at plunge diving compared to the gannet.”</p>
