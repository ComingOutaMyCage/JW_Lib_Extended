<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(SPECIAL ATTENTION AND CAREFUL STUDY OF THIS SUBJECT IS REQUESTED, FOR REASONS EXPLAINED FURTHER ALONG.--EDITOR.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;I have espoused you as a chaste virgin unto one husband, even Christ.&quot;--`2 Cor. 11:2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The letter of the Apostle Paul in which these words occur was addressed to the Church of God at Corinth and to all the saints in all Achaia (`2 Cor. 1:1`), and together with the other epistles was designed by the Holy Spirit for the instruction of the whole Church, during the entire Gospel age.  Therefore when the Apostle says, &quot;I have espoused you as a chaste virgin unto one husband, even Christ,&quot; it is evident that the entire faithful Church is meant--all who as &quot;wise virgins&quot; will continue faithful to the espousal vows.  Such will, in due time, be accepted of Christ as his glorious bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This beautiful figure of the Church's relationship to Christ is made very prominent in the Scriptures.  See the invitation to become the bride in `Psa. 45:10,11`, and the promised joy and gladness of those who accept it and prove themselves worthy of it.  Then read Paul's counsel to the husbands and wives who are truly wedded in the Lord: they two shall be one flesh--as one person, having but one mind and one common interest, purpose and aim.  And for this purpose, to this end, each is to forsake the former ties which united them to parents and brothers and sisters.  Then says the Apostle, &quot;This is a great mystery&quot;--it is something rarely seen, even among Christian husbands and wives--&quot;but I speak concerning Christ and the Church,&quot; the Bridegroom and Bride between whom the union will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --`Eph. 5:22-33`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Isaac and his wife, Rebecca, furnish a striking type of Christ and the Church as bridegroom and bride, to which we will refer later; and the Revelator points to the heavenly Jerusalem, the glorified Church, as the bride, the Lamb's wife.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The teaching of this oft-repeated and beautiful symbol, by which the Lord would have us understand and appreciate his great love and tender care for us as his Church, is so plain that it seems strange that any should fail to comprehend it; yet through a misapplication of a type some few have reached erroneous conclusions on the subject.  Two of the dear friends of the truth think they have found new light on this subject, though their views differ somewhat, and both cannot be right.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One holds that the patriarchs and prophets of the past dispensation, mentioned in `Heb. 11`, will, in their resurrection, constitute the bride; and the other holds that the bride of Christ is to be composed of the living Israelites now regathering to Palestine, who, as we have seen, shall be the first to be blessed and restored to human perfection under the new Millennial dispensation. While dissimilar in some respects, these views are sufficiently alike to be examined together.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We reply (1), It would be impossible in God's order to call the bride before the bridegroom. It pleased the Father that in the</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1386 : page 100::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Anointed One all fulness should dwell--that in all things he should have the pre-eminence. (2) It would be an incongruous and impossible union for the bridegroom to be spiritual, and the bride to be human.  It would be out of harmony, too, with our Lord's prayer, &quot;Father I will that they also whom thou hast </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">given</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">me</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with me</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> where I am, that they may behold my glory;&quot; and again, with his statements --&quot;I go to prepare a place for you,&quot; and &quot;I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also.&quot; How could Bridegroom and Bride have fellowship and union, joint-heirship and joint-inheritance, if one were of the spiritual and the other of the human nature?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Both of the objecting friends recognize the force of the type to which we long ago called attention--that Abraham, Isaac and Rebecca represent Jehovah, Christ and the Bride.  But both seem to have forgotten that a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">type</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must not be used to teach a doctrine, but merely to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">illustrate</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one that is already taught in plain terms.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Both proceed to claim that Isaac represented the entire Gospel Church--head and body-- and that Rebecca, his bride, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">must therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> represent some other class.  They claim that as we have shown, or rather as the Apostle has shown, that Sarah, Isaac's mother, was a type of the Abrahamic Covenant (`Gal. 4:24,31`), and as Sarah died before Eliezer was sent to seek a bride for Isaac, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Gospel Covenant must come to an end before the call of the Bride; and hence that the calling of the Bride will be deferred until this Gospel age is ended.  The fact that the servant is instructed not to take a wife for Isaac from among the Canaanites, but to go to Abraham's own kindred for her, they interpret to signify that the bride must be of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural seed of Abraham,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> claiming accordingly that she could not be selected from Jews and Gentiles as the Gospel Church has been selected, but must be Jewish exclusively.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have stated thus fully and clearly their position, which we believe to be erroneous, so that the answer may be the more conclusive to these friends and to all.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us see to it, beloved, that we are of those who hold the Head (`Col. 2:19`), who acknowledge in every thought and doctrine the preeminence of our Redeemer.  He is the antitype of Isaac--not we.  He, alone and apart from us, was the heir of all things.  We were strangers to him and afar off, like Rebecca, when Christ (Isaac) became Lord of all and was highly exalted and given a name above every name, and when in consequence he could say, &quot;All power in heaven and in earth is given unto me.&quot;  Ah, yes!  &quot;Of the people there was none with him.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is since he is thus Lord of all, and our Lord, that we or any have received an invitation from the Father to become his bride and joint-heir.  To us the spirit of truth declares, as Eliezer declared to Rebecca and her family concerning Isaac--His Father is very rich, and all that he hath he has given to his Son--&quot;He is Lord of all&quot; the estate, and fully his Father's representative, and the Father now seeketh for him a bride and joint-heir.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And as in the type certain gold ornaments were presented to Rebecca from the moment that she entertained the good tidings, so with us: from the moment that we first gave ear to the Father's invitation or &quot;high-calling&quot; we have been blessed.  The ornaments, being of gold, symbolize </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> blessings, gold always symbolizing divine things.  The golden adornments were first, earrings, representing the blessed effect of hearing the call; and secondly, bracelets for the hands, representing the blessed effect of the divine call upon all our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">doings</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thereafter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And so these blessings came merely from the attentive hearing of the high call; and yet greater blessings followed when we accepted that call and said that we would leave our father's house (the human nature) and our own people (earthly friendships) and go to our Espoused One. (`Psa. 45:9-11`.)  So in the type --when the decision was reached and Rebecca was &quot;betrothed&quot; or &quot;espoused&quot; to Isaac, whom having not seen she loved, the servant presented her with vessels of silver (symbolizing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truths),</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and with further jewels or ornaments of gold (divine blessings and graces), and with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> raiment, symbolizing her newness of life and relationship to the Father and the Son whose call she had accepted.--`Gen. 24:22,53`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1386 : page 101::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   And as Rebecca's mother and brother also received some valuable presents from the servant of Abraham when she received her greater blessing, this symbolizes the fact that not only are the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fully consecrated</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ones blessed when they leave all to accept the &quot;high-calling,&quot; but others of the sympathizing ones of the household of faith (the justified, but not fully sanctified) also receive spiritual blessings through the betrothed class, even before the union with the Bridegroom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It should be noted, then, that our friends are building their theories upon several misinterpretations. (1) Sarah's death before the Bride of Isaac was called would show that the promised &quot;Seed&quot; mentioned in the Abrahamic Covenant was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fulfilled in the person</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of our Lord Jesus--the heir, and the only heir under that Covenant. (`Heb. 1:2`; `Titus 3:5-7`.)  This the Apostle expresses clearly, saying--&quot;He saith not, 'And to seeds,' as of many; but as of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 'And to thy seed'--which is Christ.&quot; (`Gal. 3:16`.) That the Apostle here uses the name Christ to refer to our Lord Jesus personally, exclusive of his Church, is shown clearly by his further use of the word in the succeeding verses of this same chapter.  See `verses 22,24,26 and 27`. In `verses 28 and 29` he brings in the name Christ as applicable to all the Church, but in such a manner as to show that it is our coming into betrothal and union with him that gives us a share in that name and in the honors and glories future which it implies.  &quot;If ye be Christ's [if ye, like Rebecca, the type, have accepted the Father's offer to become joint-heirs with his Son, if ye have joyfully accepted the calling presented to you by the servant, the Spirit of Truth, and have forsaken all, and are fully betrothed to your Lord] </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [not by being, like your Lord, natural heirs of those covenant blessings, but by your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">union</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Christ] ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise&quot; [children of God, whom Abraham typified; and if children, then heirs; heirs of God and joint-heirs with, by and through Jesus Christ, our Lord].</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In `Eph. 5:28-30`, the Apostle shows that for Christ to love his bride is to love </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">himself,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for in accepting the Church as his Bride the Lord</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1387 : page 101::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">accepts her as his own body, even as in the type of this (Adam and Eve and the human union), the wife is accepted as the very flesh of her husband and her body as an addition to his members--and the husband as her head.  Thus, now, the consecrated, espoused ones while in the flesh represent Christ in the flesh; and in their daily sacrifices they are filling up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ (`Col. 1:24`); and by and by, when glorified, when made spirit-beings like their glorious Lord, they will be his glorified spouse and joint-heir, and still loved </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as himself</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--as members of his body.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, the view that the Bride must be of the natural seed of Abraham is a mistake.  Rebecca </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the seed of Abraham.  If it had been the design to represent the Bride of Christ as being taken from among the Jews, the natural seed of Abraham, no doubt a daughter of Hagar, who represented the Jewish or Law Covenant, would have been chosen.  On the contrary, when studying or applying a known type we should be sure not to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mix</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> type and antitype. Abraham as a part of the type represented God, and hence Abraham's own people represented God's people, as contrasted with the Canaanites, who represented the wilfully wicked.  This feature of the type points out to us the fact that while God does call sinners to repentance, he does not call sinners to become joint-heirs with Christ, his Son and heir.  To this close and glorious relationship he invites only those whom he recognizes as friends of righteousness and truth.  In a word, this type confirms the teachings of the Apostles, that it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we have been &quot;justified by faith, and have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, that we have access into this grace [this call to joint-heirship with the Only Begotten Son and heir] wherein we stand--rejoicing in hope of [sharing] the glory of God.&quot; (`Rom. 5:1,2`.)  Then we shall be fully united to him, and see him as he is, receive his name, which is above every name, and enter into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> mother Sarah's tent) the privileges and opportunities for blessing the world promised in the Abrahamic Covenant, represented by Sarah.--`Gal. 4:24`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So, then, we have shown Scripturally (1) that</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1387 : page 102::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Isaac primarily represented our Lord, the &quot;heir of all things,&quot; personally, and no others; (2) that the joint-heirs were represented in Rebecca, his bride, who was his only joint-heir; (3) that Rebecca typified a class selected from among </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> believers--believers in God (Abraham) and in Christ (Isaac)--which is true only of the household of faith and surely not true of the Jews; (4) that the Abrahamic Covenant, represented by Sarah, bore only </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seed, which is Christ Jesus, and that it died or ceased as a mother when he had finished his course and become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heir of all things;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (5) that if we would become joint-heirs of the opportunity and honor (of being God's seed through whom the blessing of the world will come) contained in that Abrahamic Covenant, typified by Sarah, there is no other way than by becoming Christ's--by giving ourselves to him according to the Father's invitation by the spirit of the truth--losing our own name and taking his, and forgetting our father's house (earthly hopes and ambitions) and our own people and becoming wholly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --his Bride, whom he loves and will cherish as &quot;his own body.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Next, let us look at the objection which seems to have led into the misinterpretations which we have here sought to correct.  It is claimed that because the Church is sometimes called the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ, of which Jesus is the head, it could not also be the Bride.  Therefore, say the objectors, the Bride must be one class and the Body another class.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This at first has a show of logic, but we must not trust our imperfect minds to reason straight, if we wander away from the Word and forget that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;thus it is written.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">compare</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> spiritual things with spiritual things, as the Apostle directs, and let the Word of God be its own interpreter.  Just as unreasonably might we say that if Christ is the &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; and we members of his Body, we could not also be &quot;his sheep,&quot; or members of the &quot;little flock&quot; to whom it is the Father's good pleasure to give the Kingdom, and that the little flock could not be the Bride, because no shepherd ever marries his flock.  Just as unreasonably we might say, too, that when Christ is termed the Captain of our salvation, and we &quot;good soldiers,&quot; the soldiers must be another class; because it is said that we are the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ and members in particular.  Just as unreasonably might we argue that those whom Christ is not ashamed to call his &quot;brethren&quot; must be a different class from those called the Bride and the Body of Christ, because naturally a man does not marry his brethren, nor are they his own body.  Just as unreasonably might we proceed to argue that a captain never marries his soldiers, and that hence the Bride, the Body, the Good Soldiers, the Brethren and the little flock of Sheep must be different classes.  The same reasoning would also apply to the relationship of Christ as our great High Priest and ourselves as the Royal Priesthood under him; to Christ the Pearl Merchant and the Church the pearl; to Christ the Sower of the &quot;good seed,&quot; and &quot;wheat&quot; the children of the Kingdom; to Christ the Chief Corner Stone and the overcoming Church the living stones builded up into him unto a holy temple of God; to Christ the vine and his people the branches.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A little reflection upon these facts will surely convince all that our friends were mistaken in concluding that because the Church in some places in Scripture is called &quot;the body&quot; she could not also with equal propriety be called &quot;the bride&quot; of Christ.  Perhaps, indeed, their error may result (under the Lord's overruling providence) in bringing clearer views on the subject, not to themselves alone, but also to others of the Church.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The above figures, while very different, serve, each better than any other, to illustrate some peculiar feature either of the character of the Lord or of the Church, or of the relationship between them.  For instance, as sheep the Church must be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">meek,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> willing to be led--not wayward, headstrong and perverse like goats; they must, however, not only be meek and docile and peace-loving like sheep, but like soldiers they must &quot;fight a good fight&quot; and overcome the world and its influence, conquering self and overcoming obstacles put in the way of their service for the Lord by the world and the devil.  Sheep are not overcomers and overcomers are not sheepish; two opposite truths</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1387 : page 103::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">were to be taught and two opposite illustrations were necessary: as &quot;sheep&quot; we follow our Shepherd and gladly obey his word, and as &quot;soldiers&quot; of the cross we fight against all opposition that would hinder our following and obeying our Captain; but we fight the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fight--for truth and right and love, and not selfishly and with carnal weapons.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The figure of a body beautifully represents the intimate relationship existing between our Lord Jesus and his Church.  He is the Head-- he plans, directs, supervises and cares for the various members of his body, the Church, and all real members are dependent upon each other and upon the Head and are bound together by the ties of spiritual love and common interest. And although the Head has been actually absent for over eighteen hundred years, he has yet been present in his care and by his spirit, and representatively through certain members of the body upon whom he, in his absence, confers certain gifts representing his qualities and office as the head of the Church--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eye,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mouth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ear</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> members. (`1 Cor. 12:15,21`.)  We should have missed much had the illustration of the Lord as the Head and the Church as his body been omitted.  We are glad that no good thing or illustration helpful to those who would walk uprightly has been omitted.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And when once clearly seen and fully appreciated, we feel sure that none will regret the use by the Spirit of any figures used to show the Church and her relationship to her Lord-- especially that representing her as the chaste virgin espoused to Christ and soon to be made one with him in nature and likeness and glory and work.  As the figure of head and body represented the care of the Lord in and over the Church during his actual absence in &quot;a far country,&quot; the figure of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">betrothed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or espoused virgin, longing for the coming of the Bridegroom and the consummation of her hopes and his promises, represents the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">actual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> state of the case far better.  Like Rebecca we were already virgins, pure ones, whose sins had been pardoned (by the grace of God through the atoning sacrifice of Christ), and therefore of the household of faith, before we were called of the Spirit to go to him to become his Bride and joint-heir.  Like her we each (and all of the faithful little flock from the first) have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">betrothed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to our Lord and are following on to know the Lord and to see him as he is and to share his glory--under the lead of the Spirit. Already we have exceeding great and precious promises, gifts and graces of the spirit, but we are not satisfied: we prize them and treasure them, but we think of them only as foretastes of the greater blessings to come when we shall enter fully into the joys of our Lord.  We shall be satisfied only when we shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">see him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as he is --when we shall awake in his likeness.--`1 John 3:2`; `Psa. 17:15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All along the journey, like Rebecca, the Church has been on the look-out for him whom, not having seen, she loved, and in whom, though she saw him not, yet she rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory at the thought of the coming union. (`1 Pet. 1:8`.)  And now, oh, blessed vision! our eyes of faith, like Rebecca's, are keen and we see one in the field (the world) approaching us.  Like Rebecca, we ask our guide (the Spirit of truth) who it is --half surmising from the first that it is our Beloved, as we see his stately steppings among the nations and note the promised signs of his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The Spirit of the Lord through his Word is even now assuring us that what we see is &quot;the sign [or manifestation] of the Son of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1388 : page 103::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Man,&quot; and that the hour of our rapture is near at hand.  Soon we shall pass beyond the vail of death and be with him (See `Gen. 24:64,65`) and be accepted with him into the work and office of fulfilling the Covenant represented in Sarah.  This in the type is shown by the entrance of Rebecca with Isaac into Sarah's tent.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When it is remembered that the Apostle refers to mother Eve as a likeness of the Church and father Adam as a figure of our Lord Jesus; and when we remember that in order to the development of Eve a deep sleep fell upon Adam and she was formed from his wounded side, we see a beautiful harmony between this type and the facts.  In order that we should have a being at all and be capable of receiving a call to be the Bride of Christ, it was necessary that our Lord should die for us--the deep sleep of death came upon him, his side was riven</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1388 : page 104::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">as the price of our life, our existence--and being thus justified by his death we were acceptable to him as his Bride.  When all the chaste, wise virgins </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the &quot;overcomers,&quot; the &quot;good soldiers,&quot; the faithful, fruit-bearing members or &quot;branches&quot; of the &quot;Vine,&quot; the obedient &quot;sheep,&quot; the sacrificing royal &quot;priests&quot;) have been selected and prepared and made ready for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">union</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the Bridegroom, the marriage or glorification will be accomplished; and then the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">regeneration of the world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will follow.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE REGENERATION OF THE WORLD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   But here again some are inclined to err: comparing spiritual things with natural, they fall into the error of expecting that the world will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">re-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">generated somewhat after the manner of the first generation or natural birth; and consequently they begin to wonder and speculate as to how the Bride of Christ will conceive and bring forth children during the Millennial age, and point to Adam and Eve and their offspring as an illustration of Christ and the Church and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">re-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">generation of the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All this is a mistake, and comes from carrying a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">figure</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> further than God intended, and further than the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">plain</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> statements of his Word authorize.  The expression </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">regeneration</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> does signify to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">give life again,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but it in no way implies that it will be given in the same way as now.  Adam was the first generator of his race: Christ is prepared to be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> father, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">re-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">generator to such of the race as will accept the life he offers in his way and upon his conditions. The time for this offer of regeneration to the world will be in the Millennial age, as our Lord clearly shows. (`Matt. 19:28`.)  He will then cause all to hear the good tidings that as they lost human perfection (mental, moral and physical) in Adam they may have their inherited condemnation blotted out, and may regain those blessings and favors lost, at the hands of Christ their Redeemer, by proving their desire to be at-one with God through him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As during the Gospel age the Church, the Bride, is regenerated and begotten to a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature by faith in and obedience to certain exceeding great and precious promises limited to this age, so in the next age other precious promises of earthly restitution will be the begetting influence by obedience to which, under God's arrangement, they shall be re-generated and restored to the original likeness and harmony with God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The figure of the Bridegroom and the Bride is at an end when they twain are made one.  To carry this figure further and talk about children of the Bride is unwarranted by the Scriptures, and is unjustifiable speculation.  We would have just as much right to speculate further about the Lord's &quot;sheep,&quot; and to say that sheep are cared for in order to get their wool and finally for the shepherd to sell off or to kill and eat, and that, therefore, after a while all the Church will be so dealt with by our Good Shepherd.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If the type of Adam and Eve and their union, representing the union to be accomplished between Christ and his Church, did not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">end</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at that union, but continued and included the bearing of children, then the sin of Adam and Eve and their expulsion from Eden must also be parts of the type, which must be fulfilled on a still more awful scale than the type.  But, we repeat, the type </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ended</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when Adam accepted of Eve as his wife--when they became </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for this final union or oneness and joint-heirship, between Christ and his faithful followers, is all that was intended to be typified.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Just so, too, with the type of Isaac and Rebecca: it ends where Isaac receives his espoused into his mother's tent, and does not extend to the long-time barrenness of Rebecca; nor to the two kinds of twin sons (who figure in an entirely different type, as the Apostle shows); nor to the blind old age of Isaac, and his deception by Rebecca and Jacob.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The majority of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">figures</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> used apply to and illustrate matters of the present age, and terminate with this age; being finished, they are either dropped or merged into other figures which better represent the changed condition of affairs beyond the present age.  When the new conditions have been ushered in, there will no longer be use for the symbols which now serve so well to illustrate the true Church, such as &quot;good fish,&quot; &quot;wise virgins,&quot; &quot;good soldiers,&quot; &quot;vine-branches,&quot; &quot;sheep,&quot; &quot;wheat,&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1388 : page 105::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">etc.  In connection with the parable of the harvesting of the &quot;wheat&quot; class the Lord clearly shows this change of illustration; for, instead of speaking further of glorified wheat, he changes and uses the sun as a more appropriate figure, saying: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall the righteous shine forth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as the Sun</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the kingdom of their father.&quot;  Just so with the figure of &quot;the Bride, the Lamb's wife.&quot;  It is used repeatedly in reference to the Church during the period of her espousal, but ceases and is merged into another symbol or figure with the end of this age.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who have but an imperfect knowledge of the old Jewish usage in marriage, which is the basis of the illustration, might suppose that the Church could not be appropriately or properly likened to the Bride or wife until the marriage.  This would be true according to present custom; but the Jewish custom fits the facts much better, and was doubtless so arranged of God as a type.  This old custom was for the father or some friend of the man to make a contract, arrange terms, etc., for him with the one to be invited to become his wife and joint-heir.  Such a one was called &quot;the friend of the Bridegroom.&quot;  With them this contract constituted the real </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">marriage,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but the contracting parties lived apart usually for a year, after which came the wedding feast celebrating their union, and thereafter they lived together.  John the Baptist at our Lord's first advent occupied the position of &quot;friend of the Bridegroom&quot; toward the Jewish nation--seeking to have them accept of Christ the Bridegroom and become his Bride. (`John 3:29`.) The nation as a whole rejected the offer, but a small remnant of them (the apostles, etc.) accepted, and also became in turn the friends of the Bridegroom, the mouthpieces of the Spirit to seek among God's people--believing Gentiles included--for the chaste, wise virgins and to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">espouse</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> such to Christ--telling them of &quot;the riches of grace in Christ Jesus.&quot;  While the Church as a whole is sometimes spoken of as one virgin, because the marriage to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">completed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> soon will be with one Lord, yet each faithful individual of the Church is recognized as a wise virgin, and really, each is individually and separately espoused to the Lord.  This is clearly stated by the Apostle in `Rom. 7:4`. &quot;Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the Law by the body [sacrifice] of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So then the work of espousing &quot;wise virgins&quot; to Christ as to a husband has been in progress throughout the entire Gospel age; and each espoused one is in turn permitted to serve in another capacity--as a &quot;friend of the Bridegroom&quot; to tell others of the great privilege and, co-operating with the Spirit of the truth, to say, &quot;Come,&quot; to whomsoever will. (See `Rev. 22:17,20`.) And the living representatives of this class at any time have constituted, properly speaking, the Bride or Church, although the Church or Bride will not be actually complete without all the members.  As in Jewish custom the espoused virgin was called a Bride from the time of her consent or contract with the Bridegroom, so the espoused virgin Church is called Christ's Bride--before the consummation of their union.  Accordingly, the Scriptures speak of the marriage feast coming after the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;wife</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hath made herself ready.&quot;--`Rev. 19:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In `Rev. 18:23`, when speaking of Babylon's fall, it is declared that the voice of the Bridegroom and the voice of the Bride shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be heard in her: clearly showing that previously they had spoken in and through Babylon, the confused class, and that the names Bridegroom and Bride were applicable before Babylon's fall and before the marriage feast.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In `Rev. 21:9` we are invited to &quot;come hither&quot; to the yet future standpoint and get a view of the Bride, the Lamb's wife, and see how she will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> appear.  &quot;And he showed me the holy city Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.&quot;  This, it will be noted, is given to mark the change of the symbol from a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bride</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">City;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> just as elsewhere the figure was shown to change from &quot;wheat&quot; to &quot;the Sun.&quot;  A city is a symbol of a government, and the calling of it the New Jerusalem city would signify--The new, antitypical government of peace.  There has been no occasion for the use of such a symbol during the Gospel age, because the Church has not</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1388 : page 106::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">been in ruling power; and when glorified with her Lord the figure of a virgin-bride waiting for full union with the Bridegroom will no longer be appropriate as now; hence the change from the one symbol to the other.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THY MAKER IS THY HUSBAND.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The Old Testament makes several references like the above to some union or Covenant between Jehovah and Israel.  See `Isa. 54:1-6`;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1389 : page 106::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Ezek. 16:32`; `Jer. 3:14`; `Hosea 2:2-7,14-20`. The contracting parties are Jehovah and Israel, but the reference to a union is in a less particular sense than the New Testament references to Christ and the Bride, the Lamb's wife.  Indeed, the word husband as above simply means </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">caretaker.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In another place Judah is represented as being the unfaithful </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">husband.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Mal. 2:11-15`.) In `Isa. 62:3-5`, in representing the future blessing of the land of Israel, the figure is changed, and it is said that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">her sons</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall marry her, and that she shall be as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lamp</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">crown</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the Lord's hand, and that he will rejoice over the restored land </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a Bridegroom rejoices over his bride.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of all the references `Isaiah 54` is the most explicit; and upon it God has given us light through the Apostle Paul.  (Read `Gal. 4:22-31` in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Emphatic Diaglott</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rotherham's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> translation.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here we are shown clearly that the barren woman who is to be blessed and to bring forth children and to sing, and whose Maker is her husband, refers neither to the people of fleshly Israel nor to the people of spiritual Israel. The Apostle declares the whole thing &quot;an allegory,&quot; a figure, a type; and he explains the figure.  Abraham was a type of God and Abraham's wives were types of God's Covenants. The covenant first declared was the Gospel Covenant, by which God promised to bless the world through the promised Seed, which is Christ.  This covenant was typified by Sarah. But this promise has been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">barren</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for a long time--all the families of the earth have not been blessed, although nearly four thousand years have elapsed since God recognized that covenant and swore by himself to bring forth such results.  Meantime (430 years after recognizing this covenant--`Gal. 3:17`) God made another covenant--not so great, however, nor by any means so good a covenant as the former --the Law Covenant.  This covenant was typified in Hagar, Sarah's servant.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For a time it appeared that the children of the Law Dispensation (fleshly Israel) were the full inheritors of the first promise or covenant, as Hagar bore Ishmael for Sarah and upon her knees as her representative.  In the type, Ishmael passed for a time as Abraham's son and heir, just as Israel after the flesh for centuries appeared to be the promised children of God in whom all nations should be blessed.  But not so was God's plan, according to which the offspring of Hagar the servant represented a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">servant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> class, while the offspring of Sarah represented a class of sons and heirs.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Hagar Covenant, the Law Covenant, did bring forth some noble </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">servants</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lord--&quot;Moses verily was faithful as a servant over all his house&quot; [of servants], but few in all--Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the holy prophets down to John. (`Heb. 3:1-6`.)  There the Sarah Covenant began to bear: Christ our Lord was begotten and born of the Spirit and became Son and Lord and heir of all--Christ as a Son over his own house [also sons], whose house are we if we hold fast to our hope, firm unto the end of our trial.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As Sarah had but one son, so the covenant which she represented has but one &quot;Seed, which is Christ,&quot; which, however, under God's gracious provision, is made to include all such as are accepted through Christ to be his &quot;brethren.&quot; But the promise includes not only the development and blessing of the Seed, but also the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">blessing of all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the families of the earth through that Seed, and hence, as the Apostle shows, it was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole gospel</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in few words.-- `Gal. 3:8`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Hagar or Law Covenant was again fitly represented by the rocky, barren Mt. Sinai, where the Law was given and where the Servant House was organized as a nation.  It was also represented by the capital city of that nation, Jerusalem--which was continually besieged and in captivity.  So says the Apostle: the Sarah Covenant is represented in &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exalted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jerusalem&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1389 : page 107::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--the Kingdom soon to come into power to bless the world--whose offspring and heirs through Christ we already are.  This is the city </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> government) of which Christ shall be the head, the city of the Great King of which Jerusalem the literal was but an imperfect type.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Abraham and others of the ancient worthies believed God, that he would establish righteousness in the earth, and that under his righteous government they would fully realize all that God had promised them.  It is under this perfect city or government from God, through Christ, that they shall find a country </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(literally,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a home) which could never have come under the imperfect city (government) of bondage which was typified by Hagar. (See `Heb. 11:16`.) Nevertheless, these all have been waiting for the true seed and heir (Christ) to come, and until his Church, his Bride, shall be selected and united with him; because it is by and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through us,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the Seed,&quot; that the Kingdom shall come and all their good hopes be fulfilled. --`Heb. 11:39,40`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But much of the Sarah Covenant is still future. Christ has become heir of all things, but he has not yet used his great power and reigned; he has not yet entered fully into the glory of his high office.  He has finished the sacrificial features of his work and all things are ready for the consequent work of blessing the world; but he waits, according to the Father's plan, until his &quot;brethren,&quot; his &quot;body,&quot; his Bride, shall be selected and have herself ready.  And we, his espoused--what of us?  We are coming to him and to the Kingdom which he and the Father have promised; we are running the race for the great prize of our high calling to joint-heirship in his divine nature and glory.  We are not, filled with fearful apprehensions, approaching Mt. Sinai with its thunders and with its Law which none could keep, but we are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">approaching</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a very different condition of things, which should and does fill our hearts with rejoicing. We are approaching Mount Zion [the Kingdom of Zion], the city [government] of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to [association with] an innumerable company of angels--a full assembly--and to the gathering together of the Church of first-born ones, having been enrolled in the heavens, and to a Judge who is God of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to the Mediator of the New Covenant--Jesus--and to the blood of sprinkling which speaketh better things than that of Abel [which speaks our pardon and peace instead of crying for just vengeance]. This, beloved, is what for eighteen hundred years and more we have been approaching, and which now, thank God, we are very near.  But the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is approaching another manifestation of divine power, more terrible than that at Sinai, and of which that was but the illustration --a time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation--no, nor ever shall be again --a trouble in which both the symbolic earth (society) and the symbolic heavens (ecclesiasticism) shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shaken</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and utterly removed, to make room for our Kingdom which shall never be shaken, because founded by love and mercy upon principles of justice.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">AUGUST 1891.--EDITORIAL NOTES.--NO. II.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The climate of Jerusalem surprises us.  It is pleasantly cool at night, and, although hot at midday, it is decidedly cooler than we had expected to find it.  The mountain air is very pure and invigorating.  Jerusalem is a mountain city--in the tops of the mountains.  The four mountain-tops or hills within the present walls evidently represented four small cities at one time, each with its own wall--Mt. Moriah, Mt. Zion, Mt. Acra, Mt. Bezetha, all surrounded by a general wall.  The city at one time may have been nearly a half larger than at present, including more of Bezetha on the northwest and more of Zion on the southwest. The difficulty in determining arises from the fact that the city has been destroyed and rebuilt so many times.  Excavations in various directions continually reveal old fragments of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1389 : page 108::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">walls or cisterns or other ruins, sometimes fifty or even seventy feet below the present surface. The Tyropean valley is now almost level full of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">debris</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> upon which houses have been built and inhabited these many years.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At first the city of Jerusalem is disappointing. It is built after the manner of Arabian cities generally.  The streets are mere alleyways, and are not depended on for ventilation, except for the small shops or bazars. The dwellings merely connect with the street by a door or an occasional window.  The inhabitants seem to rely for light and ventilation upon inner courts from which access is had to the various apartments.  The present buildings, aside from those of the various religious societies and government and hotel buildings, are generally very inferior; yet one is sometimes surprised at the contrast between the outside and the inside of some of them.  Nor need we be surprised if, as the people become degraded, their ideas of architecture also depreciated. Certainly the very ancient ruins from time to time uncovered exhibit more of art and dignity than do the modern stone structures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The present population is said to be fifty thousand.  To suppose that it ever contained a million people, as Josephus intimates, one would be obliged to conclude [1] that the city was larger than at present; [2] that then as now the people here lived more closely than in American or European cities (except in the quarters of the very poor); [3] that the siege was at the time of a feast which drew many people to Jerusalem from all parts of Palestine and from outside countries; [4] that the people from suburban villages crowded into the</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1390 : page 108::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">city for protection from the Romans; and [5] that Solomon's quarries and stables would, in such an emergency, shelter fifty thousand people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One is impressed from the first with the fact that Religion is the chief business of Jerusalem. Our guide informs us that there are over seventy convents.  These, representing various religious factions, all seem to be imbued with the one error--viz.: that their duty in life is to pray much and often and to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">do nothing.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Each sect thanks God that it is not as the others and especially not like the poor people who do a little honest work, and, according to divine arrangement, earn their bread by sweat of face.  Few of them esteem very highly the great apostle who wrote against those &quot;forbidding to marry&quot; and those &quot;who labor not at all.&quot;  These very religious people all claim to live by faith; but the opinion of &quot;the common people&quot; is that they enjoy many of the substantials and even of the luxuries of the present life.  Of course all claim that they trust to God for food and clothing; but from their craftiness many believe that their faith rests largely upon the credulity of their fellowmen, whose large and warmer hearts are moved by misplaced sympathy to assist them.  These, without exception, we believe, claim to practice celibacy.  They are supported by friends and religious orders in Europe and America, and by the liberal donations of visitors, who regard them as martyrs.  They include Catholics of all shades, Greek, Roman, Armenian and Syrian, &quot;the Americans,&quot; &quot;the Germans&quot; (or Society of the Temple) and Mohammedans. The Armenian convent on Zion Street is the largest.  It can accommodate with lodgings about eight thousand pilgrims.  The pilgrims, especially of the Greek and Armenian churches, come in great numbers at the Passover anniversary of our Lord's death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We enter the city at the Jaffa gate, the nearest to our hotel, on the way passing large numbers of new buildings erected by Jewish societies and others, and much more modern looking than those within the walls.  The new outside portion is known as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new Jerusalem.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The Jaffa gate is the busiest of the city's gates: it is thronged with people and camels and donkeys and trades-folk carrying and crying their wares, especially eatables, and with cripples and blind seeking alms.  Our dragoman leads the way to clear a path for us, and must repeatedly shout &quot;O-ah!&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;Look out!&quot; or &quot;Take care!&quot;) to camel and donkey drivers, to prevent our being run over or jammed between a donkey's and a camel's burden and the wall; for we are not, like the natives, accustomed to looking out for ourselves and dodging.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here, near the gate we have entered, is the Tower of David or the stronghold of Zion.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1390 : page 109::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(`2 Sam. 5:7`.)  Opposite is a large new building erected in 1886.  It is occupied by stores below and a hotel above, and was the first modern building erected in Jerusalem for other than religious purposes.  In excavating for its foundations the ruins and foundation of the Tower of Hananeel were discovered, and it is built partly upon the old wall of the Tower. Now read the Lord's promises--`Jer. 31:27,38-40`: `Zech. 14:9-12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Passing along Zion Street we come to a building with a black dome said to be built over the cave where David, Solomon and many others of Israel's kings were buried. (`1 Kings 2:10`.) The tomb is in the possession of the Mohammedans, who permit no one to enter it.  A large room above it, thirty by fifty feet, is accessible, however, and we enter it.  This &quot;upper room&quot; is reputed to be the one where our Lord ate the Last Supper with his disciples, and where they tarried after his ascension and were anointed with the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. It is supposed that it was here that Peter preached the discourse in which he remarked that David's sepulchre was still with them. (`Acts 2:29`.)  In memory of the Lord's washing of the disciples' feet in this &quot;upper room,&quot; Roman Catholic monks now wash the feet of some pilgrims, yearly, on the Anniversary.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our guide says that a splendid view of the city can be had from the housetop of &quot;the Americans.&quot;  They welcome us to enter, and we thankfully avail ourselves of their kindness. They invite us to sit down, and our conversation naturally drifts into religious channels, the Lord's promises to the land and the people. They give us a poor account of the missionaries, and declare that they do harm rather than good to the natives, all of whom, they aver (except those in their employ), despise them. As to the nature of their sins, we can learn no particulars, except that they are haughty and lordly in their bearing toward the poor natives. The Bishop of the Church of England (imitating the Patriarchs of the Greek and Roman Catholic churches), when passing through the streets, is preceded by two servants, one of whom carries a whip to clear the way while the other shouts to make way for the superior. Among independent-minded people, such as the Arabs, we can readily see that such a course would win but few hearts, even though long accustomed to such treatment from Turkish government officials.  The Americans declare that they are there to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">live</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before the people true Christian lives, and believe they are doing more for the cause of Christ than the missionaries. This seems good, and we are greatly interested in them and inquire concerning the nature of their work.  To our surprise, they have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;no work,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no mission among the poor, ignorant people who so much need instruction and help.  Their idea seems to be that living </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good lives</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> consists in living as &quot;a unity&quot;--as one family, trusting in the Lord to supply their needs.  They claim that thus they follow Christ's footsteps, who had not where to lay his head, and that the early Church had formed a unity. (`Acts 4:32-37`.)  We answer that the Lord went about </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">doing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> good and had to be about the Father's business; point out that the principle of community, tried in the early Church, had not been taught by Christ; that it had failed; and that the Apostles nowhere taught that such communities were to be formed.  In proof we cite Paul's advice that men labor with their own hands, that they may have to give to those in need (`Eph. 4:28`), and that for charities each should lay by him, on the first day of the week, according as the Lord had prospered him. (`1 Cor. 16:2`.)  We urge that these instructions are opposed to &quot;community.&quot; They do not like Paul so well, so we refer to our Lord's dying words to John, in obedience to which John took Mary to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">own house&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`John 19:27`), proving that our Lord had neither taught nor practised communism, although that will be more nearly the practice of the future.  But when they find the sword of the spirit too sharp for their theory, they say they fear that discussion is not profitable. We realize the shrewdness and worldly-wisdom of their leader in this and other matters, and, remembering that the Lord had said, He that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hath an ear,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> let him hear, we conclude that it is his will that we say no more to these who, at present, have no ear for the truth.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">LESSON III., APRIL 17, `PSALM 19:1-14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.&quot;--`Verse 7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   It is good to meditate upon, to ponder, the Word of the Lord; for only in so doing can we receive the nourishment it is designed to give. A hasty reading of the Scriptures and a quick return of the mind to other thoughts and pursuits makes a spiritual dyspeptic, incapable of assimilating the spirit of the truth and lacking the strength and power of mature and developed Christian character.  The Psalmist beautifully represents the proper attitude of all those who truly love the Lord, and who therefore delight in his Word and plan: &quot;His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night;&quot; &quot;I will meditate of all thy work, and talk of thy doings;&quot; &quot;I will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways.  I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word;&quot; &quot;Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors;&quot; &quot;I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands;&quot; &quot;O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day; ...therefore I hate every false way....Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever;&quot; &quot;My meditation of them shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.&quot;--`Psa. 1:2`; `77:12`; `119:15,16,24`; `143:5`; `119:97,104,111`; `104:34`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here, as well as in the lesson under consideration, the two great books of nature and of revelation are pointed out as special themes for the meditation of those who love the Lord and who desire to know more of him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verses 1-6` refer to the silent yet eloquent testimony of nature to the power and skill and wisdom and goodness and glory of its divine Author.  Its testimony may be read by the thoughtful of every land and of every language, by day and by night, in all the earth.  &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.&quot;  Job, considering the testimony of nature to the glory of God, says, &quot;He is wise in heart and mighty in strength...which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south; which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.&quot; (`Job 9:4,9,10`.)  And the Lord, desiring to reassure Job of his superior power and grace, inquires of him, &quot;Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1391 : page 110::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Orion?  Canst thou bring forth the constellations of the Zodiac, each in its season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?  Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? or dost thou appoint its rule on earth?&quot;--`Job 38:31-33`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus, by their numberless multitude, their orderly grouping in various constellations, their continual yet never conflicting movements, their perfect harmony, their magnitude and their mutual benign influence, do the shining hosts of heaven declare the glory of God, by day and by night.  He who meditates upon these things will scarcely be &quot;the fool&quot; who saith &quot;in his heart, There is no God;&quot; for all nature testifies to the Creator's glory and power.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verses 7-11` refer us to the yet superior glory of God's special written revelation of himself, given through his inspired human agents, the prophets and the apostles.  This testimony not only declares the existence and power and wisdom of God, with a silent intimation of his goodness and grace, but with overwhelming force it bears to the thoughtful mind the convincing testimony of all his glorious attributes and of all his love and grace toward us in Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Hear the Psalmist: &quot;The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.&quot;  Other influences may lead to temporary and partial changes of course and action, but nothing else equals God's revealed Truth in producing a change--change of being, character, soul.  It is because other converting agencies and powers are so often used (instead of this one which God has provided) that there are so many merely glossed-over, nominal Christians, as compared with the few whose entire beings are turned and fully consecrated to the Lord. People may be converted from savagery to civilization by a general knowledge; or from intemperance to sobriety by a study of the advantages of the latter over the former; or from dishonesty to honesty by learning that &quot;Honesty is the best policy.&quot;  But none of these are soul conversions.  Only God's truth can produce soul conversion, as also our Lord indicates in his prayer, &quot;Sanctify them through thy truth-- thy word is truth.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The testimony of the Lord is sure [not doubtful, but clear and positive], making wise</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1391 : page 111::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">[not the heady and wilful who have plans and theories of their own and who do not submit themselves to the will and plan of God, but] the simple&quot; [the single hearted who have no will or plan of their own which they wish the Lord to adopt, but who seek the Lord's will only].</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The statutes </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[piqqudim</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--appointments: the appointed plans] of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.&quot;  Yes, indeed, God's glorious, appointed plan of the ages rejoices the hearts of all who have come to a knowledge of it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The commandments </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[mitsvah</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--precepts or teachings] of the Lord are clear, enlightening the eyes&quot; [showing us the unmistakable course and end of righteousness and of unrighteousness].</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The fear </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[yirah</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--reverence] of the Lord is clean [a pure and lofty sentiment based upon love and gratitude, and not upon a servile recognition of tyranny and power], enduring forever.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The judgments </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[mishpat</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--ordinances or decrees] of the Lord are true; they are altogether righteous.  More to be desired are they than gold; yea, than much fine gold: and they are sweeter than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb.&quot;  Once, following the leadings of mistaken teachers, and catechisms, we thought of God's &quot;Eternal Decrees&quot; only with horror, supposing that they provided for the salvation of but a mere handful of our race and for the everlasting misery of the masses. But what a change since the eyes of our understandings are opened.  God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">decrees</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are sweet to our taste, we appreciate them greatly, we see that he has decreed a Great Savior and a great salvation, open to every creature's acceptance; and that he has provided that all shall be brought to a clear knowledge of the truth, that they may have the fullest opportunity for everlasting life upon the only condition God can make--righteousness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Moreover, by them [by the judgments or decrees of the Lord as to the course of righteousness and unrighteousness and their rewards and penalties] is thy servant [the thoughtful servant, who meditates on these things] warned; and in keeping them [in remembering and harmonizing with them] there is great reward.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus the Book of Nature and the Book of Revelation, when rightly read, harmoniously declare the glory of God; and blessed is the man whose character is ennobled and purified and blessed by constant meditation on these glorious themes.  How it refreshes and strengthens every noble and generous aspiration, checks every tendency to evil and sin, purifies the heart, kindles hope, awakens zeal and starts and keeps us in the heavenly race with its glorious end in view.  The great Emperor of this wonderful universe upon which we daily and nightly cast our wondering gaze has called even us to be the bride of and joint-heir with his only begotten Son, the heir of all things; and in these glorious revelations of himself is supplied the inspiration and instruction necessary to enable us to run with patience the race set before us, if we make them the centre of our meditations.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verse 12`--&quot;Who [in his own strength or by his own wisdom and foresight] can guard against errors?&quot;  Not one; for as the Apostle Paul tells us, we have our treasure, the new nature, in earthen vessels.  Not only are we weak, mentally, morally and physically, but in addition we have a wily foe: we wrestle not merely with flesh and blood, but also against principalities and unseen spiritual powers, strongly entrenched in places of power and influence. (`Eph. 6:12`.) Who, indeed, is strong enough in himself to guard against errors of doctrine and practice strongly entrenched in a misguided and depraved public opinion, fortified by the tendencies of his own impaired conditions of mind and heart and skilfully glossed over by the great deceiver who, with untiring effort, seeks to accomplish our deception and overthrow? Who, indeed, is sufficient for these things? The inquiry of the Psalmist implies the answer --Not one.  In our own strength we cannot presume to stand, and therefore how appropriate the prayer:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verses 12-13`. &quot;From secret faults do thou cleanse me.  Also from presumptuous sins do thou restrain thy servant; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Sins of presumption are such as result from undue </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">self-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">confidence, ambition or pride.  Many are guilty of them without seemingly being aware of the fact: They </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presume</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in prayer to direct the Lord how they want to have numbers join some sect, whose existence God never authorized; or they say how many they want to have converted at a certain meeting; or they instruct him how the Foreign Missions should be blessed and what results they shall expect.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Others presume to decide what God intends to do aside from what his Word authorizes, and will perhaps pass lightly over such a doctrine as that of the Second Death if it stands in the way of a favorite theory which they have prepared for the Lord to follow.  This is presumptuous sin.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Others, on the other hand, tell that God will everlastingly preserve the wicked in torture, and thus they are in error from attempting to be wise above what is written.  Is not this a presumptuous sin?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Such presumptuous sins bring natural </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">consequences:</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1391 : page 112::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the presumptuous lose </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">respect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for that which they can do without, or can twist and turn to their own convenience.  As respect for the exactness of the Bible is lost the presumption naturally increases and finds more pronounced expression in their self-assurance. Some, indeed, go so far as to interpret the language of Scripture the opposite of the way in which it reads, to favor the ideas of the presumer, whatever they may be.  Thus one will read that certain wilful sinners who sin against full light and knowledge &quot;shall be punished with everlasting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">destruction,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;in the second </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and will unblushingly assert that these words mean the reverse--that they mean everlasting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">preservation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and in torment.  Others, to support an opposite theory, will claim that the Second Death means a second blessing, and that when it is declared that at the end of the Millennial age of trial all those whose names are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> found written in the Book of Life--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fearful,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unbelieving,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">abominable,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> those who in spirit are whoremongers, murderers, sorcerers, and idolaters, and all who love lies and take pleasure in making them--that when these are said to be cast into the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second Death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it means that they will be blessed, sanctified and ushered into glory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Ah! yes, beloved, this sin of presumption is one into which many who have been enlightened by a knowledge of the plan of God are inclined to fall.  Instead of carefully noting and thoughtfully considering those scriptures which, while they recognize their superior advantage and special favor from God in a knowledge of the truth, also warn them of the great danger of those thus enlightened (since the present is the judgment-day of all such, who stand on trial for life, with the alternative of the second death before them)--instead of carefully observing these (See `Heb. 6:4-8`; `10:26-31`; `Rev. 2:11`; `20:6`), they ignore them, and, presumptuously leaning to their own understanding, proceed to reason in this wise: --They say, The Scriptures tell us that &quot;God is love,&quot; so loving that he has provided salvation for all mankind.  So far they say truly; but here leaving the Scriptures they begin to reason--as they claim, to the glory of God, though nothing can be to the glory of God which perverts or denies any portion of inspired truth.  They say, &quot;Yes, and we have faith (?) to believe that his love is so powerful</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1392 : page 112::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">that not one rebellious sinner can ever get away from it; and if one millennium is not sufficient to reform him then he shall have another and another; for all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">must</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be saved.&quot; But here are the Bible warnings of a Second Death for wilful sinners, and coupled with the statement, too, that Christ dieth no more and that, consequently, such can never be redeemed again, if found worthy of the second death for their own wilful sins, committed with full knowledge and with full responsibility.  The redemption provided in Christ is complete and for all, providing full salvation for every child of Adam from all the penalties and weaknesses sustained through Adam's disobedience and fall from divine favor.  But having had such a salvation put fully within their reach, each is thereafter responsible exactly as was Adam; and each is subject to the same penalty--death --if wilfully disobedient.  This is called the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> death because it is the penalty of wilful sin under the second trial.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the presumptuous ones grow more arrogant and self-assertive and take the further step of denying the necessity of a ransom, claiming that the death of Christ did not redeem us from the first death, that we were not bought with a price, that they had formerly made a mistake in thinking so, and that their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imitation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of Christ's life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is all that divine justice can demand of them or of any man.  Thus they do despite to the spirit of grace manifested by Jehovah in the gift of his only begotten Son, our Redeemer, and presume to stand in the filthy rags of their own righteousness.--`Isa. 64:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">They fall into this great error in their attempt to establish their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presumptuous</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> theory. For they see that if it be admitted that the penalty of sin was death when Adam was tried, and if the death of Christ was necessary as the payment of that penalty before any could be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pardoned,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> granted </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">liberty</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to become sons of God or be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrected</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 3:24-26`; `Col. 1:20-22`; `1 Cor. 15:21,22`), then, since God changes not, there could be no hope of escape from the second death except by the payment of a second ransom-price for each one so sentenced.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus presumptuous sins pervert the judgment, make void the Scriptures and lead to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">great transgression&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of &quot;counting the blood of the covenant wherewith we were sanctified a common thing.&quot; (`Heb. 10:29`.)  In view of such temptations and tendencies, let the consecrated ever bear in mind that their only safety is in meekness and humility, clinging close to the word of the Lord; and in meditating on its precepts and pondering over all their solemn and momentous import.--&quot;Then shall&quot; they &quot;be upright, and they shall be innocent from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the great transgression.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And let the constant prayer of all such be--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verse 14`. &quot;Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The Convention for Bible Study and for commemorating our Lord's death, recently announced to be held in Allegheny from April 7th to 14th, is just closed.  It has been one of the most interesting of the kind ever held here or perhaps anywhere; for we may scarcely except the gatherings of the early Church in the days of the Apostles.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In numbers the meeting was greater than any of its predecessors--about two hundred attending from neighboring cities, towns and states, in addition to about the same number of home residents.  And all these we may safely count as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">interested ones,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> because others were invited to stay away.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The visitors came various distances, and represented the following states:  Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Manitoba Canada, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Iowa and Michigan.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1393 : page 114::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This meeting seemed to surpass its predecessors in spiritual tone, if that were possible --but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">last</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> always seems to be the best.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The meetings began at six o'clock on the morning of the 7th, in the various bedrooms where the friends were billeted, and continued during breakfast until nine o'clock, the hour of the public meeting--from which the time until ten o'clock was devoted to prayer, praise and exhortation. The morning session for Bible study began at ten o'clock and lasted until one.  The afternoon session began at three o'clock and lasted until six. Then came a luncheon and chat followed by evening session for testimony, praise and mutual rejoicing.  The latter we endeavored to close at nine o'clock, but sometimes they continued until after eleven.  Even after retiring some could not restrain themselves to sleep and let others sleep.  And at and between all of these meetings, the topic was the love and plan of God, the centre of that love and plan-- the cross of Christ, the blessings already ours through it, the blessings yet to flow from it to the world, and the consecration of heart and every talent to the service of this loving God, this gracious plan and this mighty Savior.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All seemed to show on their faces what they attested with their voices--that their hearts were full and overflowing with the love of God and Christ, resulting from the fact that the light of the glory of God as it shines in the face of Jesus Christ our Lord had shined into their hearts.  The Bible study sessions lasted for five days and were followed by two days of conference by and with the Colporteurs relative to their important part in the harvest work. Five new workers decided to give their time in this blessed service which the Master has so signally blessed.  Each pledged himself to earnest service to our Redeemer and King during the year beginning, and promised to remember one another continually at the throne of grace.</font><br />
