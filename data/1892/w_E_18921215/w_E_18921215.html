<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;HIS WAY IS PERFECT.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;As for God, his way is perfect: the Word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that put their trust in him.  For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God?&quot;--`Psa. 18:30,31`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   God's way is his plan or purpose, that which he purposes to accomplish and which he is steadily working out according to the counsel of his own will.  Men also have various plans and purposes of their own which they try to work out as nearly as possible.  Some men purpose to amass a fortune; some to acquire a liberal education and vastly to increase their mental capacity and power; others to gain fame and popular applause, or social or political preferment, etc., etc.  But to most men the way they choose proves unsatisfactory after a brief trial, and they turn restlessly from one way to another; and even when they pursue one way to the end they realize that it has been an unsatisfactory way and that the end is not worthy of the strife necessary to gain it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then again men have their various ways or theories as to how God will or ought to accomplish the world's salvation.  Some claim that it will be accomplished by a process of evolution, and that it is due to the race by right. Some of these blasphemously claim that the present degradation of the world is directly chargeable to God, who, they say, is the real author of all the sin and wickedness we see in the world--that he made men so, and is therefore bound </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in justice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to bring them up to a better condition.  Then there are others who claim that God has predestinated the vast majority of mankind to eternal torment without any will or choice of their own, their doom having been unalterably sealed before they were born, while a small minority were likewise unalterably elected to eternal salvation and happiness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But these and various other incongruous theories are only the ways of men, which have no foundation in the Word of God, except as men pervert that Word.  It is a serious matter for any of God's children to accept or entertain such views of his character and plan when it is so clearly stated in his inspired Word; and any one who can hear our heavenly Father's character thus traduced without feeling or expressing his righteous indignation is disloyal to God and unworthy to bear the name of Christ.  If we have so much regard for the friendship of those who advocate such views of God's character that we cannot reprove their course, we also rank ourselves with the enemies of the Lord, and he will surely so regard us.  Such indifference to God and his truth shows clearly that there is something wrong at heart; and sooner or later such will drift into the outer darkness unless they promptly repent and resolutely determine to make no compromises with error and to cultivate no friendships with the enemies of the Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, &quot;As for God, his way is perfect;&quot; and his Word clearly sets forth his way to all the simple minded ones who take him at his word and who have no fine-spun theories of their own to establish.  In coming to God's Word it is always important to remember that our attitude should be that of the disciple, and not</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1480 : page 372::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the teacher.  Such an attitude is itself a long step in the direction of a knowledge of the truth; for it is written that God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. (`James 4:6`.) If we come to his Word as reverent students, expecting to find therein the delineation of the pure and righteous character and plan of our God, that plan and character will be revealed to us; but if we come to it in a captious spirit and with impure and unholy thoughts and ambitions, we have just the kind of poor imperfect brains that can warp and twist the Scriptures to suit our own ideas.  If we put on the colored glasses of prejudice we can read God's Word as seen through them only.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is what the Psalmist implied when he said, &quot;With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright; with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward.  For thou wilt save the humbled people, but wilt bring down high looks.&quot; (`Psa. 18:25-27`.)  And again we read, &quot;A scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not, but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth;&quot; and, &quot;There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.&quot;--`Prov. 14:6,12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">O! how we need to beware of &quot;high looks&quot; and of the pride that goeth before destruction and of the haughty spirit that precedeth a fall. (`Prov. 16:18`.)  For if in pride we go about to establish our own ways, and do not fully submit ourselves to the right ways of the Lord, we will surely deceive ourselves and be led away by the error of the wicked, so that God's way or plan, as viewed through the colored glasses of our ambitions and prejudices, will seem to our distorted vision as the Psalmist describes --unmerciful, impure and perverse, instead of as it really is--merciful and holy and righteous altogether.  There is nothing more dangerous than pride, whether it be manifested in a love of display or in ambitions to be great or to be thought well of by others.  If we are ambitious to be more generous than God, and go about to establish the idea of the absolute certainty of the everlasting salvation of every individual, when God plainly speaks to the contrary; or if we ignore God's appointed means of salvation, which is by faith in the precious blood of Christ shed for the remission of sins, and endeavor to climb up to life by some other way, and to teach others to make the same effort; or if we repudiate the doctrine of the original perfection of man, who was created in the image of God, and also that of his own free will he fell into sin and thereby incurred its just penalty--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not eternal torment; or if we seek out any other human invention contrary to the Word of God, and go about to establish it, it is pride that is asserting itself; and if it is not promptly humbled it will surely and shortly end in complete alienation from God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dearly beloved, let us fear lest a promise being left us of entering into God's rest--into the rest of abiding faith in his way, his glorious plan--any of us should come short of it, and instead of calmly and confidently resting in God's way and in the blessed hope of its glorious outcome, we be left in confusion and doubt upon the whole subject.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But if you have thus far stood firmly in the faith of God's way, we are persuaded better things; and if with the Psalmist you can say, &quot;My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed&quot; (`Psa. 57:7`): if your heart is established in love and reverence and faith in the sure Word of God, then with the Psalmist you may also say, &quot;For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.&quot; (`Psa. 18:28`.) Yea, has it not been even so?  Surely hitherto the Lord hath led us.  The language of the prophet applies to all those humble and faithful ones whom the Lord has been leading-- &quot;For by thee I have run through a troop [of opposing enemies]; and by my God have I leaped over a wall&quot; [of bondage, into the glorious liberty of a son of God].--`Psa. 18:29`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Beloved, have you been thus overcoming? have you been following the Lord's leading? have you found and are you still abiding in the sweet rest of faith in his plan, in his way, not your own?  &quot;As for God, his way is perfect:&quot; it is just and merciful and benevolent and wise and practicable and sure of a glorious termination. &quot;The Word of the Lord is tried:&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1480 : page 373::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">when fully understood it will stand the test of every argument that could be formed against it as to its justice, its wisdom or its benevolence. Of this we are fully assured by our Lord, who prophetically declared that the testimony of those who come to a full knowledge of God's plan will be--&quot;Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.&quot;-- `Rev. 15:3`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Lord is a buckler [a defence] to all those that trust in him; for who is God [is mighty] save the Lord? or who is a rock [a safe anchorage to our souls] save our God?&quot; There is no other one to whom we may anchor our faith and hope; but, securely anchored to him, we may trust and not be afraid, and may sweetly rest under the shadow of his wing. &quot;The Lord liveth; and blessed be our rock; and let the Lord of our salvation be exalted.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1480 : page 373::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">FAITH VERSUS SUPERSTITION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   There is a vast difference between these two principles which is not always discerned among the children of God, so that a superstition based upon a fundamental error of doctrine often passes current for superior and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wonderful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> faith.  And such persons are often lionized among their brethren as saints of remarkable attainments, while the more logical and thoughtful, who exercise a more real faith, are often far less esteemed among their brethren, though doubtless more approved of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Real faith always has a good, sound, reasonable basis.  It is simply an established confidence. You have faith in your friend because, you say, you have known him for years: you have observed and mentally noted his principles of action, and have found them uniformly the same; he has always been just, true, benevolent and kind; for many years and under many tests you have observed his steady faithfulness to these principles, and so your confidence or faith has been so established that you never think of doubting him.  You know, judging</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1481 : page 373::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">from the past, that he will always be true to these principles, and hence can often tell just what his future course will be in various contingencies that may arise wherein these principles may be involved.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Just so it is with those who have become acquainted with God through his Word and his providences.  From year to year their confidence or faith has grown and taken deeper and deeper root, until every promise of God is now to them yea and amen in Christ Jesus.  They know that what he has promised he is able to perform and that he will do it, and they make all calculations accordingly and live and work in this confident hope.  Such a faith is a real faith: it has been real from the beginning, but it has matured and strengthened with the proofs of passing years.  Such a faith is not mere surmise, imagination or guesswork: it has a sound, logical basis.  You have drawn certain positive conclusions from a logical argument based upon an infallible and undeniable premise; and consequently you have full faith in those conclusions.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But superstition, unlike faith, has no substantial basis; nor are its conclusions reached by logical deductions.  Superstitions originate in the diseased brains of fallible men, and upon no subject are they so prevalent as upon religious subjects.  Here they are legion.  They are in direct opposition to true faith and should be carefully avoided by every sincere child of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And not only should we avoid the superstitions themselves, but we should be careful to so frame our conversation that our true faith, minus all superstition, may be apparent to all. As instances of the lack of such care, we often hear such expressions as, The Lord told me thus and so, or, The Lord showed me this or that, or, The Holy Spirit taught or showed me thus and so, when the more careful Christian, who has a true faith and who is carefully instructed in the Word of God, often sees that this supposed or claimed teaching of the Lord or of the Holy Spirit is a fundamental or dangerous error, which is being thus put forth with</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1481 : page 374::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the stamp of divinity forged upon it.  Thus to stamp and send out error, if done intelligently and with a purpose to deceive, would be willfully to counterfeit the truth--a very criminal offence against God; but many very good people do it quite ignorantly.  And what we are saying now is merely a caution and exhortation for such to greater carefulness in this respect.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us not be sure the Lord has shown us this or that item of doctrine or course of conduct unless we are able to put our finger on the testimony of the Lord which has borne this witness to us, so that the faith of our friends, as well as our own faith, may stand, not in the questionable wisdom of fallible humanity, but in the power of God's own sure testimony. The Lord reproves very sharply some who recklessly use the expression &quot;The Lord hath said&quot; to give </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">weight</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to their own imaginings or opinions. --`Ezek. 22:28`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Beloved, let us not cultivate the habit of speaking in that irreverently familiar way of the Lord which is becoming more and more common among many of the subtle adversaries of the truth, of saying, The Lord told me, as though he had spoken to you face to face, or through some medium other than he has appointed for all his saints.  Let us do all things with a view to edifying, and not in a manner to &quot;darken counsel by words without knowledge.&quot; (`Job 38:2`.)  &quot;Except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken?&quot; (`1 Cor. 14:9`.) And &quot;Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.&quot; --`Eph. 5:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And, further, do not aspire to be a man or woman of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;wonderful&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> faith: just be contented with a simple, child-like faith that believes every thing God says and refuses to believe what he does not say on matters of divine revelation. There is nothing wonderful or specially praiseworthy about a real faith.  On the common principles of reasoning we ought to have full confidence in every item of God's Word, and should continually act upon it.  Let our rejoicing be in the testimony of our conscience, that with the greatest simplicity and sincerity (not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God) we have spent our lives in this world.  Especially should we be sincere toward the household of faith, whose development and perfecting should be our deepest concern.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WATCH TOWER TRACT SOCIETY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">SECRETARY'S REPORT.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">FROM DECEMBER 1ST, 1891, TO DECEMBER 1ST, 1892.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Nothing, perhaps, furnishes so sure an indication of love for the truth as zeal to serve it-- financially and otherwise.  Judged from every standpoint, the past year has been one of great refreshment and of great spiritual development among our readers.  Not, of course, with all-- for, like other years, it has witnessed the turning of some from the light into the &quot;outer darkness&quot; of this world's wisdom--but to those who have been earnestly running the race it has been one of deepening experience.  Undoubtedly the following of the Apostle's instruction, to lay by on the first day of the week according as the Lord hath prospered each (`1 Cor. 16:2`), has had its beneficial influence in the direction of this heart-warming mentioned: and the increase financially, and the increased effort made for the blessing of others, are clearly seen in the report following.  The spiritual tone, as indicated by the wonderful letters we receive daily, is fully in harmony, and the fact is that the warmest letters are from those who joyfully share in one way or another the burden and heat of the day.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Cash receipts from &quot;Good Hopes&quot; and other donations, including sale of Olive-wood Mementoes, $8298.31.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Amount expended in forwarding the truth in various ways--tracts, postage, etc., etc., $8298.31.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Since these sums are exactly alike, it becomes proper to explain that the Fund had really spent</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1480 : page 375::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">more money than its receipts, and would have shown an indebtedness had not a deeply interested friend of the cause learned of the situation and made up the deficiency, enabling us to start the new year free from debt.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The following is a summarized statement of what was done with the above money in circulating the truth in the way of tract distribution.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Total number of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Old Theology Tracts</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and Sample TOWERS circulated free, by mail and otherwise, 536,503.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As tracts are usually reported by pages we will so state the circulation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Total Amount in tract pages, 18,569,392.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Besides this large showing in Tract distribution, the fund supplied large numbers of the Lord's children, too poor to buy, with DAWNS and TOWERS free, over 70,000 copies of the WATCH TOWER going to our regular poor list.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It will be noticed that the above report makes no mention of the MILLENNIAL DAWN work being prosecuted chiefly through colporteurs. The reason is that, so far as possible, the DAWN is made to pay its own way--the price at which it is supplied to colporteurs just about covering cost of publishing and postage and incidental expenses.  The Tract Fund therefore needs not to be hindered for this great and important part of the work, except that it supplies a credit account to enable some of the Brethren and Sisters to get a start in this work.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Trusting that the year beginning may be as blessed and prosperous as the one just closed, I have the honor to subscribe myself your servant and the Lord's,</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">OBEDIENCE BETTER THAN SACRIFICE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   How necessary it is that we all hear and obey the voice of our good Shepherd.  &quot;My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me,&quot; was the Master's pointed statement of the case. And it is all in vain that any ignore his words, and yet hope to abide in his love and favor. An illustration of this truth came forcibly to our attention during the past six weeks, and we relate it here, not for the sake of the one vitally concerned, but for the benefit of others who may have similar besetments, and to whom this narrative may prove &quot;a word in season,&quot; cautioning that obedience is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">better</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than sacrifice.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the Colporteurs, an earnest, devoted sacrificer, but whose spiritual state had for some time caused us anxiety, recently wrote to us that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">peace</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God no longer ruled his heart; that he had lost that communion with the Lord which is so essential to a Christian's happiness and welfare.  Some extracts from his letters at the time will show his deplorable state, and give cause for the greater rejoicing that he has since been restored to divine favor. On receipt of his first letter, telling of his plight and asking for help, we felt greatly relieved, knowing that it was a hopeful sign to see him realizing his position and longing for divine favor, and so we wrote.  In reply he said:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dear Brother Russell:--Your kind letter received. It both surprised me and made me feel ashamed.  The surprise was that you say I was nearer to God and nearer to his blessing when I wrote my last letter than for a long time before; while in reality I feel as if God is now far from me.  The more I try to lay hold on his promises the less I seem to realize them as mine.  The Lord knows what is in my heart, anyhow, so I might as well reveal it.  I have kept the matter to myself long enough and found that it did not change my wretched condition of heart.  The shame is that I should need such advice as you gave me--to &quot;lay aside my proud, know-it-all spirit,&quot; etc.  I feel the full force of that advice, as I am indeed guilty of just such a spirit.  I always knew that I had a strong self-will, and therefore hesitated almost two years to be immersed, because I knew it symbolized the death of self, the death of my own will.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I had always tried to keep self under but failed, till at last, considering God's promise, that his grace is sufficient for us, I took the step and made outwardly the confession that I would reckon myself dead, and accept God's way and will instead of my own.  Looking back now, I see that I again failed; for I by no means &quot;paid unto the Most High my vow.&quot;  In my    ::R1481 : page 376::    case the words of Paul seem to be fulfilled: &quot;If a man strive for the masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.&quot;  Surely I have been striving, but, considering the effects, it had brought me almost to despair and made me look with dread to meet the Lord instead of with joy and confidence.  I must have been striving unlawfully.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I almost believe that, as you state in your letter, it is &quot;pride and self-will&quot; that have made the wall that separates between God and me.  Your kind letter throws some light on my trouble, showing me just why I could not &quot;enter into his rest.&quot;  How highly I prize those promises made to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;meek</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lowly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of heart.&quot;  I now realize that God shows favor only to the humble, and see that I could not claim his promises for the very reason that he has not made any promises to such as I have been.  &quot;Oh, to be nothing, nothing,&quot; shall henceforth be my prayer. How very thankful I feel towards you for pointing out to me just where I failed.  Sorry that you no sooner dared to put me on my guard: it would have saved me many a tear.  I am glad to know that you remember me in prayer, and especially that you prayed for me even before I wrote you of my wretched condition of heart.  It was perhaps your prayers on my behalf that helped me to overcome my pride to the extent of this confession.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While I always felt humble before God, it had seemed impossible for me to be humble before fellow men.  None but myself knows how great a struggle it was for me to write to you in the way I did.  Even after the letter was written I hesitated to send it, but I now feel that to overcome even in so small a matter as this brings a certain amount of blessing.  I feel much more free to write this letter than the former one, because I ignored my own will, and contrary to my own inclination humbled myself, no matter what the opinion of others might be.  I shall once more start out, relying upon God's help to overcome that which hinders me from entering into rest.  I have just opened my heart before you that you might be better able to judge just why it was impossible to overcome.  Any advice will be gratefully accepted.  I feel fearful and beclouded, because of my previous failures to overcome.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I clearly see that if I do not overcome I can never fall back on a restitution; for I have in the past made a definite consecration of all human hopes and aims, and of human rights and privileges.  Nor do I desire to go back; for I know what it is to be in harmony with God. I know something of the joy and peace which I once had.  If I had not had a taste of it, I would not now know of what I was void.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1482 : page 376::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Another trouble with me, I think, is that I am not filled with the Spirit of love.  If I were I should have no trouble in overcoming.  &quot;To will is present, but how to perform I find not:&quot; this seems to be my experience continually. Can you wonder that I feel distressed and helpless when I look at myself in the light of the past, feeling that I was never able fully to carry out my consecration.  How much more imperfect must have been my effort before God?  I feel really unworthy to be a worker in this &quot;harvest.&quot;  I am condemned when speaking about the truth.  I hear continually the reproof of our Lord to those devils which said that they knew he was the Son of God, but our Lord forbade them.  This shows clearly to me that he wants only such as are truly his.  I lack all evidence now that I am his.  I speak to others about this &quot;rest,&quot; but I am myself unable to enter.  Oh, that the Lord once more would show mercy to me!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I will now conclude this report, whereof a mere nominal Christian should be ashamed, but how much more I, who claim to have come out from among them into higher light.  Pray earnestly with me for complete deliverance.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I remain sincerely yours, trusting in the precious blood of Christ as the only hope,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                              __________.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The above letter was answered and the following came quickly:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dear Brother Russell:--Yours of the 24th inst. received.  Your letter sounds very hopeful, and would perhaps six months ago have filled me with joy, but now it only increases my sorrow. After reading it carefully I looked up all the passages in the Bible to which you alluded, to see whether there was such hope for me or not.  The passage in `1 John 1:7`, which you show me to mean that Christ not only justifies us from past sins, but that he also justifies us from our daily short-comings, reads to me very different.  I wish I could make it read so.  To me it reads: If you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">walk</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the light, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you have fellowship, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the blood of Christ cleanses you from all sin.  Can I, under those limitations, claim that promise?  Have I walked in the light?  If I had, I would not now need to ask you which be the first principles--how to obtain peace with God--which every one ought to know.  The Apostle (`1 John 4:4`) says: &quot;Ye are of God, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">have</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> overcome.&quot;  It is clear to be seen from such limitations that my case could not be covered.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You also quote, from `Psalm 103`, that God has mercy upon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who come to him.  But here he also limits it to a certain class (`verse 18`), to which I can not belong, however much I may</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1482 : page 377::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">desire it.  I have never kept my covenant with God (even when I tried hard) to my own satisfaction --how much less to God's pleasing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Next you quote `Heb. 4:15`.  This of course shows that our dear Lord can sympathize with us in temptation, but whether he can or will sympathize with us after we have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">yielded</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to it I can not see in that text.  I would need a high priest who could sympathize with one who has given way to temptation.  The next text, `1 John 2:1`, gives me some little hope, but so very slight that I scarcely dare trust in it, because the context seems to show that the sins referred to are not the kind that I have reference to--pride and self-will.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It appears to me that the Scriptures teach that after we have once accepted Christ as our justification we must walk in the increasing light, and that as soon as anything is revealed in us being contrary to God's will we must at once put it away.  If we would continue to go on in that way, putting evil away just as quickly as it is brought to our attention, we would never live in any conscious sin: and consequently all those promises of forgiveness of our faults unknown to us would be verified.  We would even then continually need the blood of Christ to cleanse us from the sins which we commit from lack of knowledge.  My trouble is that even after I see my faults I cannot rid myself of them and get into harmony with God's will.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I shall rejoice if I ever succeed in living up to the best of my knowledge.  To this end I have been praying for the last month, but all effort seems vain.  I have never before felt the depravity of my nature so fully as for this last month.  Before, I always knew it as a theory; but still I had thought that we could bring ourselves into subjection to God's will if we only tried.  After examining the Bible closely, I awoke to the fact that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I myself</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was altogether out of harmony with God's will.  My first thought was to secure his forgiveness for my great error, and to get into harmony with his will.  When I began the study of God's will, I verily thought I could learn his will from the Bible, and then do it.  But the result of this was to lead me into greater despair, for I found myself unable to do his will.  I had never seen the greatness of God's will as I now see it, and I never saw so fully that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> am as a worm which has nothing at all of which to glory.  I had heretofore thought I was some one, and could do so and so, but now I see that I am a slave to self and can do nothing, not even carry out my own desires when I have no one with me to hinder me.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I feel no nearer to God now than I did when I first wrote to you about my trouble: it rather gets darker all the time.  Oh, I do feel wretched!  I feel just as if I had been a deceiver because I pretended before the Brethren and Sisters with whom I met to have the same joy and peace which they had, when in reality I felt far from God.  In their presence (if I was called on to pray) I would address God from their standpoint and thank him for things which I myself did not realize.  Perhaps a few hours later I would address God privately, in my closet, and tell him how much I was in need of those things, for which a few hours before I had publicly thanked him, as if I possessed them.  How abominable my course must have been to the Lord!  No wonder he has abandoned me from having communion with him.  The more I think of the past the worse I feel about it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Until lately I never thought of its being wrong, and asked God to give me rest, when in reality I was in my own way, and therefore could not receive it.  I never really knew what was the cause of my not &quot;entering into his rest,&quot; until my distress was so great that I thought of writing to you about it.  I shall ever be thankful to you for pointing out to me that my own pride was in the way of receiving God's blessing.  I have at last so far learned from my brief experience to humble myself under the mighty hand of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">No longer do I feel </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">self-sufficient</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor, as you expressed it in your first letter, that I &quot;know it all.&quot;  Continue to pray for me: it may be the Lord will yet in mercy remember me again, and give peace to my soul.  Let me hear from you soon.  Correct me if you find that this is not the way to find peace.  Yours in Christ, __________.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Poor heart! it was indeed in a wretched plight.  But those are valuable lessons for all to learn--of the deceitfulness of our own hearts and of our inability to commend ourselves to God; and happy are those who can learn them from the Word of the Lord so as not to require to experience them thus.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Still longing for God, the Colporteur came to us several hundred miles, for further counsel and assistance in seeking that peace which is beyond all price, which the world can neither give nor take away, but which each can so easily forfeit for himself by disobedience to the voice of our Shepherd.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In personal conference we pointed out the necessity for honesty with the Lord, how pride and self-will are the deadliest foes of all who have consecrated themselves wholly to the Lord.    ::R1482 : page 378::    This brought forth a confession of how the darkness seemed to get into the troubled heart --about as follows:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In meeting with others, I have somewhat the gift of debate, and can argue whatever side of a question I choose to take up.  The Brethren and Sisters generally gave heed to the warnings of the Lord, called to attention in the WATCH TOWER, to the effect that when we have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">proved to ourselves</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that any theory, teacher or publication is astray on the great fundamental doctrine of Christianity--the death of Christ as the ransom </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(corresponding price)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all--we should thenceforth have nothing whatever to do with such (`Eph. 5:11`; `Rom. 16:17`; `2 John 10,11`; `Gal. 1:8-10`); but I took a different course.  It was after seeing the evil effects my liberality had upon me that I began to look the subject up, and then pride came in and would not permit me to confess my error, but rather said: &quot;Hold on to the position you have taken.&quot; In my effort to justify the liberal position which I had taken, I became the defender of doctrines which I knew were untrue--doctrines at variance with the truth; and I tremble as I reflect how I endangered others by my wilful course.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This came about gradually; and I now see that I was losing the Lord's favor gradually, although I did not notice for some time, nor realize the cause, until in my despair I wrote to you.  When once I realized that pride was at the bottom of it, I was enabled to trace the matter to its true source, as well as to see the horribleness of my own position.  Indeed, while I see the truth clearly, in harmony with its presentation in the DAWNS, I confess that in my restless state I began to look around for something else--seeking rest and finding none. Truth began to get valueless.  It lost its powerful influence over me.  I verily believe that I was nearing the condition mentioned in the parable as &quot;outer darkness.&quot;  But now, since I see and confess my error and am earnestly seeking the Lord, the truth again has a powerful influence over me; but I fear so much that I have been so unfaithful that the Lord will never own or use me again.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Lord graciously blessed us in pointing out to the troubled one the way of peace.  We pointed out that while the sin was great, the</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1483 : page 378::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">confession showed that, though it was a sin worthy of stripes, it had features which clearly showed that it was not the sin unto death, of which the Apostle warns us (`Heb. 6:4-6`; `4:26-51`); for now, under full knowledge, the sin is not continued as a sweet morsel, but is despised and confessed and abandoned.  We showed that the measure of wilfulness had already had stripes--divine disfellowship--that a portion of the sin can clearly be traced to Adamic weakness, and that this portion therefore is forgivable through the merit of our Great Redeemer's sacrifice--made once for all the race, and for all sins and weaknesses entailed upon us directly or indirectly as children of Adam. We pointed out that not only the ambitious pride was in part an inherited weakness, but the weaknesses of others which served as a temptation was also a result of the fall; and that it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">because</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we cannot do perfectly what we learn of God's perfect Law that we need a compassionate High Priest and an abundant sin-sacrifice, and that we have such a sacrifice and such a High Priest--Jesus our Lord and Redeemer, by whose stripes we are healed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The realization of his own helplessness clinched this Scriptural argument, and Jesus was seen as our Savior, in a grander, completer sense than ever before; God's favor was gratefully accepted and we knelt and thanked the Lord for the light (he promising thenceforth to walk in it, and to confess the error as publicly as it had been committed); giving thanks for the leading of his providence which had recovered a straying sheep when it had realized its lost condition, and cried out again for a place in the fold.  And, above all, we thanked him for the lengths and breadths of the loving provision made for covering all our sins and weaknesses when fully acknowledged, repented of and forsaken; and there the covenant of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">full</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> consecration, even the giving up of self-will and self-pride, was renewed.  Thus the troubled one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">began</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to enter into REST.  That same (Sunday) evening the opportunity was embraced for confessing publicly to the Church at Allegheny the error, the darkness which had followed, the humiliating route back to God and    ::R1483 : page 379::    peace, the forgiveness, the returned peace of God's favor, and the determination that henceforth, while continuing to offer himself a sacrifice in God's service, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obedience,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is still more acceptable to God, should have first attention. It was also stated that hereafter, instead of feeling more benevolent than God and the apostles toward those in error, the effort would be to take </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> prescribed course, rejecting hereafter all teaching, oral or printed, that does not rest squarely upon the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom-price</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> given and finished at Calvary, obeying the injunctions of the apostle, that if any bring another gospel, to receive it not, and to have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no fellowship</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reprove them;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for he that biddeth God-speed to an evil doer, an evil teacher or an evil doctrine is a partaker in the evil.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So far from despising the Colporteur, we all loved and esteemed him more than ever; for it is only a true and noble soldier of the cross who can thus shatter the idol of his own pride and self-will, and lift up the royal banner of his Redeemer.  He has since returned to his field of labor and made similar confession to those whose faith and rest he once endangered, and he is now rejoicing in the peace of God which passeth worldly understanding.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This report has been seen by him and approved before publication, and is published as a testimony of God's forgiving love, and that it may help in bearing up the &quot;feet&quot; of the body of Christ--lest any should stumble utterly over the stumbling-stone, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that all might be planted the more securely thereon.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">RETURNING FROM THE CAPTIVITY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I. QUAR., LESSON 1., JAN. 1, `EZRA 1:1-11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;The Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee.&quot;--`Deut. 30:3`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The events of this lesson are located at the close of the seventy years desolation of the land of Israel and of the captivity of the people of Israel in Babylon.  The cause of this long exile and this utter desolation of their land is stated to be their failure to let their land enjoy its sabbaths (`2 Chron. 36:21`), according to the command of the Lord, who, by this typical observance of sabbath or jubilee years, purposed to prefigure the blessed Times of Restitution, in which time the continually recurring cycles were ultimately to terminate.  But though the people were negligent of the command of the Lord, and only partially observed this requirement, God did not permit their indifference to mar his typical prophecy, but turned even this circumstance to account in making the prediction still more emphatic by showing the exact number of typical jubilees which culminated in the grand antitype or &quot;times of restitution of all things,&quot; and thus pointing out the exact date, both of the times of restitution and also of the Lord's second advent, which is due at that time. (`Acts 3:19-21`.)  See MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. II., Chapter vi., also Lesson X. in our issue of Feb. 15th.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And not only had Israel neglected to observe properly the typical Jubilees, but they had lapsed into idolatry and had polluted the house of the Lord, and they had mocked his messengers and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the Lord rose against them with the sword and with captivity and with the destruction of their temple and with the utter desolation of their land for seventy years. See `2 Chron. 36:14-21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But when God had served his purpose of chastising Israel and of completing his typical prophecy--when the three score and ten years of desolation of the land, in which the land had enjoyed her sabbaths, had expired, the return of the captives was due.  The great clock of ages pointed to the time for the return of the exiles, and, like every other feature of God's plan, the deliverance of Israel from Babylon was promptly on time, and the agent for the accomplishment of their deliverance was on the spot.  God had him marked out by the Prophet Isaiah for this very purpose, calling him by name and specifying the work he was to do.  See `Isa. 44:24,28`; `45:1-6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is pleasing also to note that in the land of their captivity Israel (with some exceptions)    ::R1483 : page 380::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">were reclaimed from idolatry so thoroughly as never to return to it again; and then, without the temple and its services, they learned to appreciate what was left to them still--the Word of God and the teaching and counsel of some of the faithful ones among them, such as Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah; and thus for a time the forms of worship gave place to a more real heart-worship of the one true God; and they were led to a fuller appreciation of the privileges they had enjoyed, as manifested in `Psalm 137`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When Israel was restored, however, it was not as masters of the land, but as servants of Cyrus and his successors; for, according to the words of the Prophet `Ezekiel (21:25-27`), they were never again to possess the land as an independent nation until he should come whose right it is to rule--even their long-promised Messiah.  The reference here is evidently to the Lord's second advent; for at his first advent he did not come to rule, nor did they at that time, nor ever since, gain full possession of their land.  They were always tributary to other nations until they were finally--A.D. 70 --dispersed among all the nations; and so they have continued until the present time, when, the time having come, their regathering has begun.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The &quot;`golden text`&quot; of this lesson has reference, not to the return of Israel from this captivity in Babylon, nor from any of the minor captivities, but to the great regathering from among </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all the nations</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whither the Lord had scattered them. (See `Deut. 30:3-5`; also `Jer. 32:37-42`.) This is a deliverance which will need no repetition; for they shall be firmly planted and established in their everlasting possession. (See `Jer. 24:6,7`; `31:28`.)  This deliverance is already beginning and shall be fully accomplished by the close of &quot;The Times of the Gentiles.&quot;  See MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. III., Chapter viii.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The story of the deliverance of Israel from the captivity in Babylon is not only a historic fact, but it has also its typical aspect.  The captivity of Israel after the flesh in literal Babylon represented the subsequent captivity of spiritual Israel in &quot;Babylon the Great&quot;--the great Antichristian nominal church; and the deliverance of fleshly Israel by Cyrus, whose name signifies sun or brightness, represents the deliverance of spiritual Israel out of &quot;Babylon the Great&quot; by the bright shining of the Sun of Righteousness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And as Cyrus commanded the faithful people in Israel to return to the land of promise and to rebuild the waste places and to take possession of and replace in the temple the golden and silver vessels which the king of Babylon had profaned (`Dan. 5:1-4`), so the light from the rising Sun of Righteousness now indicates to the faithful children of God who are still in &quot;Babylon,&quot; the great nominal church, the duty and privilege of returning to the blessed inheritance of the saints--the exceeding great and precious privileges of the sons and heirs of God--and of replacing in his spiritual temple, which is the true Church, all the golden and silver vessels--the divine and the natural truths or doctrines--so long perverted in &quot;Babylon&quot; during the dark ages of bondage and superstition.  As to the progress of this work, see MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. III., Chapter iv.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">REBUILDING THE TEMPLE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I. QUAR., LESSON II., JAN. 8, `EZRA 3:1-13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;They praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.&quot;--`Ezra 3:11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The narratives of the building and the rebuilding of the temple, as mere matters of history, would be of little importance or interest to us were it not also for the fact of its typical character.  Viewing it thus, there is still in the history of that temple and in its prophetic teachings that which should enkindle in our hearts greater enthusiasm, zeal and joy than was ever expressed by those who saw its material glory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the light of the teachings of the apostles we see that the antitype of that temple was the one true Church of the living God, whose names are written in heaven (`1 Cor. 3:16,17`; `Luke 10:20`)--that it is a spiritual temple built up with living stones, of which Jesus Christ is himself the chief corner stone, the sure foundation. He became the foundation of this spiritual house when he gave his life a ransom for many, and thus made possible the building up of other living stones upon this foundation until the wonderful structure shall reach its glorious completeness.--`1 Pet. 2:4-7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When this foundation of the spiritual temple was laid, all who came to a realization of the importance of the great work thereby accomplished rejoiced and praised the Lord. And this rejoicing in the strength and security of the foundation of our hopes never ceases. Praise the Lord! wells up from every heart that realizes the redemption accomplished by the precious blood of Christ, shed for many for the remission of sins.  Upon this sure foundation the temple structure has been gradually and steadily progressing.  The living stones are taken out of the quarry (the world), and, by the experiences and discipline of the present life, they are shaped and chiseled and polished</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1484 : page 381::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and thus fitted for their places in the temple which, during the time of the presence of the Lord--viz., since 1878, when he took his great power as king--is being noiselessly put together, as in the type, without the sound of a hammer--by the resurrection of the dead in Christ and the change of the living in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye; for &quot;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth [from 1878];...they rest from their labors [from the toil and weariness of labor], but their works follow with them.&quot;  They shall not sleep, but they shall be changed instantaneously from the human to a glorious spiritual body.--`Rev. 14:13`; `1 Cor. 15:51,52`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, while the Church glorified with Christ the Head will be the temple complete and glorious, it is in a less complete sense regarded as the temple of God now, and the various members as its builders, all having something to do in building each other up in the most holy faith, and thus contributing to the structure of the temple or Church as a whole.  This work of building up the Church is very clearly set forth in the building of the typical temple; and the rebuilding of the temple after the captivity in Babylon is very suggestive of the rebuilding of the Church after the long captivity in Babylon the Great--which is generally known as the Great Reformation.  And truly there has been a great Re-formation of the Church since the dark ages of bondage under the papal yoke.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The work of re-formation has gone steadily forward and, like that of the typical temple, in the midst of great opposition. (See `Ezra 4:11-24`; `5:3-5`; `Neh. 4:7-23`, and compare MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. II., Chapter ix, and Vol. III., Chapter iv.)  From the multitudes who had been enslaved under the papal rule some of the living stones of the true temple were gathered out and the work of setting them in order for the rebuilding of the New Jerusalem and its temple began.  History records the opposition which these re-formers or builders, encountered; and truly, as in the type, &quot;the builders, every one had his sword [the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God] girded by his side, and so builded.&quot; (`Neh. 4:18`.) Nor may this attitude ever be relinquished until the work is all complete and the glory of the Lord has filled his temple.  The enemies of the Lord's people and the Lord's work are always active in opposition, and none the less so when their methods are subtle and their course not easily discernible.  Hence the necessity for continued vigilance against every encroachment of the adversary, whether he come as a roaring lion or as a wily serpent.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To all who are laboring in the great work of building up the true temple and city of God, the success of Ezra and Nehemiah and their co-workers should be regarded as an encouraging prediction of the final completeness and glory of the Church built upon the one true and only foundation, Jesus Christ our Redeemer and Lord.--`1 Cor. 3:11`.    ::R1484 : page 381::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I. QUAR., LESSON III., JAN. 15, `HAGGAI 2:1-9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build it.&quot;--`Psa. 127:1`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Again we are led to view the rebuilding of the temple in its typical character.  In our previous lesson we saw that the foundation was re-laid amidst great rejoicing, and that then, on account of the opposition of their enemies, the work was for a long while abandoned. Having been thus hindered in the great work, Israel gradually became indifferent and indisposed to encounter again the difficulties necessary to its further prosecution, and became more and more engrossed with their own affairs, leaving the house of the Lord still in ruins.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As a consequence of this growing indifference to the house of the Lord, God's favor was measurably withdrawn from Israel and they were visited with drought and threatened with famine.  Then came a message of reproof from the Lord to them, chiding them for neglecting the important work of rebuilding the temple and giving themselves up to their own pursuits. (`Hag. 1:1-11`.)  When the Lord thus stirred them up to a sense of duty and privilege in the matter, the people and their leaders obeyed his voice and again began to build, and the Lord encouraged and helped them.--`Hag. 1:12-15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In all this what a vivid type we have of the great reformation work which began in the sixteenth century with the preaching of Luther and his contemporaries, briefly noted in the preceding lesson.  We call to mind that the one great work accomplished at that time was the laying again of the foundation doctrine of &quot;justification by faith&quot; in the one &quot;continual&quot; sacrifice of Christ, in contradistinction to the papal dogma of &quot;the mass,&quot; which had set aside the &quot;continual.&quot; (`Dan. 11:31`.)  Thus again Christ Jesus became the recognized foundation of his temple, which is the Church. This done, there was great rejoicing among those interested and engaged in the work. While the re-laying of the foundation progressed the builders were greatly opposed, so that they were obliged to keep themselves continually armed with the sword of the Spirit against their enemies.  But, as in the type,    ::R1484 : page 382::    when the foundation was laid they began to grow weary in well-doing and weary of contending against opposition, and so, with a few exceptions, abandoned the work, and spiritual drought and famine followed.  Protestantism ceased to be a protest against the iniquitous system that gave it birth, and for a time made no further progress beyond the re-laying of the foundation of the temple of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But by and by the message of the Lord was impressed upon some faithful souls, who still longed to see the completion of the temple of God, to arise again and build, to clear away the rubbish of false doctrine and establish the faith of the Church in the truth--that they might be living representatives of the truth, not error, and thus be recognized of God as living stones in his temple.  Since the re-awakening the work has been going forward (See MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. III., Chapter iv.); and the Word of the Lord to all the workers is the encouraging promise that, when it is completed, it shall be filled with glory.--`Hag. 2:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And not only so, but it is also written that &quot;The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts.&quot; (`Hag. 2:9`.)  That this was not said with reference to the temple of Zerubbabel, which did not excel nor equal the former temple, is manifest, and therefore the expression must be regarded as a prophecy of the glory of the antitypical temple of God--the glorified Church.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let those, therefore, who are zealously engaged in the work of the Lord--in building up the Church, the temple of God, in the most holy faith--hear the Word of the Lord by the Prophet `Haggai (2:4-9`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 4`. &quot;Be strong, and work, for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 5`. &quot;My spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSES 6,7` remind us of the similar promise of `Malachi 3:1`. &quot;Behold, the Lord shall suddenly come to his temple,&quot; his Church; and it is his glory that shall fill it--the glory of his presence, his power, his righteousness and his authority; and the whole Church shall be imbued with the same, as his worthy joint-heirs in the kingdom.  And when the Lord thus comes to his temple the whole earth will see his glory --will recognize his authority and power.  And when he is thus recognized and the blessings of his kingdom begin to be experienced, he will indeed be, as the Prophet expressed it, &quot;The Desire of all nations;&quot; for it is also written that he is the &quot;Prince of peace&quot; and that he will speak peace unto the nations&quot; (`Hag. 2:9`; `Zech. 9:10`), and that &quot;In this place [by means of his temple] will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The shaking of all nations--the heavens [the present ecclesiastical powers] and the earth [the whole civil organization of human society], the sea [the lawless elements] and the dry land [the more settled and law-abiding of mankind] --reminds us also of the expression of `Malachi (1:2`), &quot;Who may abide the day of his coming?&quot; and of the predicted judgments of `verse 5` against all evil-doers; as well as the explanation of the Apostle Paul (`Heb. 12:26,27`) that &quot;This word, 'Yet once more' signifieth the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">removing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of those things that are shaken,... that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Praise the Lord! the things that are to be removed are the unsatisfactory things of the present order, and that which is to remain is the Kingdom of righteousness and peace, under Christ the Prince of peace, whose glorious reign when fully inaugurated and manifested will indeed be &quot;the desire of all nations.&quot;</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CREED-MAKING IN JAPAN.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   According to a recent issue of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Missionary</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Review,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the native Presbyterian Christians in Japan have taken the matter of creed revision into their own hands.  The synod of the Church of Christ in Japan, composed of the various Presbyterian bodies, has refused to adopt the Westminster Confession of Faith, or any other similar doctrine.  They have fallen back upon the Apostles' Creed:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In the Confession of Faith will be observed a significant silence upon the subject of retribution and of the future state.  It reads thus: 'The Lord Jesus Christ, whom we worship as God, the only begotten Son of God, for us men and for our salvation was made man and suffered. He offered up a perfect sacrifice for sin; and all who are one with him by faith are pardoned and accounted righteous, and faith in him working by love purifies the heart.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;'The Holy Ghost, who, with the Father and the Son, is worshiped and glorified, reveals Jesus Christ to the soul, and without his grace, man, being dead in sins, cannot enter the kingdom of God.  By him the prophets and the apostles and holy men of old were inspired, and he, speaking in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, is the supreme and infallible judge in all things pertaining unto faith and living.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;'From these Holy Scriptures the ancient Church of Christ drew its Confession; and we, holding the faith once delivered to the saints, join in that Confession with praise and thanksgiving.'&quot;</font><br />
