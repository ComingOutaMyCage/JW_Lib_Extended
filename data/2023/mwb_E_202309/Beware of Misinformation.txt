TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Beware of Misinformation




Eliphaz may have seemed to be a trustworthy source of information because of his age and background (Job 4:1; it-1 713 ¶11)
He was influenced by demonic forces to convey a discouraging message to Job (Job 4:14-16; w05 9/15 26 ¶2)
Some of what Eliphaz said was true but misapplied (Job 4:19; w10 2/15 19 ¶5-6)





Satan’s world continues to spread harmful misinformation.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘Do I take the time to evaluate the information that I take in?’​—mrt 32 ¶13-17.
