LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Rely On Jehovah When Dealing With a Bully




Bullies can cause us physical and emotional pain. They can even harm us spiritually if we become intimidated when they oppose our worship. How can you protect yourself from a bully?
Many of Jehovah’s worshippers have successfully dealt with bullies by relying on Jehovah. (Ps 18:17) For example, Esther spoke up in order to reveal the plans of an evil bully named Haman. (Es 7:1-6) Before doing so, she showed her reliance on Jehovah by fasting. (Es 4:14-16) Jehovah blessed her actions and protected her and his people.
Young ones, if you are confronted by a bully, ask Jehovah for help and talk to a mature adult, such as a parent, about your problem. You can be sure that Jehovah will help you just as he helped Esther. What else can you do to cope with bullying?
