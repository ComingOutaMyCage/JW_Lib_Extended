TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
When Life Feels Unbearable




When under trial, Job likened life to compulsory labor (Job 7:1; w06 3/15 14 ¶10)
His distress moved him to express his feelings openly (Job 7:11)
He even expressed his desire to die (Job 7:16; w20.12 16 ¶1)





If you ever feel that life is unbearable, pour your heart out to Jehovah in prayer and express your feelings to a mature friend​—this may be your first step to finding some relief.​—g 1/12 16-17.
