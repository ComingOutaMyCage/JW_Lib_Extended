Help Nonreligious People Come to Know Their Creator


Do you ever hold back from giving a witness to nonreligious people, thinking that they are unlikely to respond favorably? If so, remember that many nonreligious people​—including atheists—​have become Jehovah’s Witnesses. Often, all they needed was a little help examining evidence that God exists.​—Ro 1:20; 10:14.

How to do it
If a person expresses disbelief in God, be kind, tactful, and genuinely interested in his thoughts and feelings on the subject. (2Ti 2:24) Discuss topics that are likely to appeal to him. Is he open to discussing evidence that has led many to believe in a Creator? If so, use the publications and videos designed for that purpose. The brochures Was Life Created? and The Origin of Life​—Five Questions Worth Asking have been added to our Teaching Toolbox to make them easily accessible.

At first, you may feel intimidated by the idea of discussing the truth with someone who does not believe in God. Why not ask an experienced publisher for assistance? Remember, too, that Jehovah can help us to reach the hearts of those rightly disposed​—even if at first they do not believe that he exists.​—Ac 13:48.
