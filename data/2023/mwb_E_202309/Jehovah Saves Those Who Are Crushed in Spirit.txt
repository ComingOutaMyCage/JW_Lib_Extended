LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Jehovah Saves Those Who Are Crushed in Spirit




Everyone feels sad sometimes. Feeling sad is not a sign of spiritual weakness. After all, even Jehovah revealed that he experiences sadness at times. (Ge 6:5, 6) But what if we feel overwhelmed with sadness often or even all the time?
Turn to Jehovah for help. Jehovah is very interested in our mental and emotional health. He knows when we are happy and when we are sad. He understands why we think and feel the way we do. (Ps 7:9b) Most important, Jehovah cares about us and can help us to cope with feelings of sadness or even depression.​—Ps 34:18.
Take care of your mental health. Negative emotions can affect our happiness as well as our worship. For this reason, we do well to protect our heart​—our whole inner person.​—Pr 4:23.
