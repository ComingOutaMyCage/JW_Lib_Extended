LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Parents​—Help Your Children to Gain Godly Wisdom




One of the best ways that parents can help their children to gain godly wisdom is by helping them to benefit from Christian meetings. What young ones see, hear, and express in their comments at meetings can help them learn about Jehovah and become his close friend. (De 31:12, 13) If you are a parent, how can you help your child to get the most out of the meetings?
  Make an earnest effort to attend meetings in person.​—Ps 22:22

  Allow time for encouraging association at the Kingdom Hall before or after the meeting.​—Heb 10:25

  Ensure that each family member has a copy of the publications being studied at the meeting, whether digital or hard copy

  Help your child to prepare a comment in his or her own words.​—Mt 21:15, 16

  Speak positively about the meetings and the instruction you receive there

  Help your children to be involved in such activities as cleaning the Kingdom Hall and speaking with older ones in the congregation


Helping your children to draw close to Jehovah requires a lot of work, and it may seem overwhelming at times. However, you can count on Jehovah’s help.​—Isa 40:29.
