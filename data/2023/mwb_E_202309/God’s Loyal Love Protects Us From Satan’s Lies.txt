God’s Loyal Love Protects Us From Satan’s Lies




Satan wants people to believe that Jehovah causes bad things to happen (Job 8:4)
He would like us to think that Jehovah does not care whether or not we keep our faith in Him (Job 9:20-22; w15 7/1 12 ¶3)
Jehovah’s loyal love helps us to see through Satan’s lies and maintain our integrity (Job 10:12; Ps 32:7, 10; w21.11 6 ¶14)





TRY THIS: To strengthen yourself during a trial, take note of ways that Jehovah is showing loyal love to you, write them down, and review them often.
