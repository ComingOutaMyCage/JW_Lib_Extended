TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
A Lesson in Good Communication




Esther waited for the right time to speak up (Es 7:2; ia 140 ¶15-16)
She spoke with tact and respect (Es 7:3; ia 140 ¶17)
She was open and honest (Es 7:4; ia 141 ¶18-19)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I imitate Esther’s example when communicating with members of my family?’
