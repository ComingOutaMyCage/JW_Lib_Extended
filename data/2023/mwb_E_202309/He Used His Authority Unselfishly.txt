TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
He Used His Authority Unselfishly




Mordecai received a position of great authority (Es 9:4; it-2 432 ¶2)
He instituted a yearly observance to honor Jehovah (Es 9:20-22, 26-28; it-2 716 ¶5)
He worked for the good of God’s people (Es 10:3)





Today, those who have a measure of authority in Jehovah’s organization do their best to imitate Mordecai’s example.​—cl 101-102 ¶12-13.
