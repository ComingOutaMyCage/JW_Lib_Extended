<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Bullies can cause us physical and emotional pain. They can even harm us spiritually if we become intimidated when they oppose our worship. How can you protect yourself from a bully?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many of Jehovah’s worshippers have successfully dealt with bullies by relying on Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:17-19:18:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 18:17</a>) For example, Esther spoke up in order to reveal the plans of an evil bully named Haman. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:7:1-17:7:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Es 7:1-6</a>) Before doing so, she showed her reliance on Jehovah by fasting. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:4:14-17:4:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Es 4:14-16</a>) Jehovah blessed her actions and protected her and his people.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Young ones, if you are confronted by a bully, ask Jehovah for help and talk to a mature adult, such as a parent, about your problem. You can be sure that Jehovah will help you just as he helped Esther. What else can you do to cope with bullying?</p>
