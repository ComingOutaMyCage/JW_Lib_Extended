Shepherds Who Work for the Good of Jehovah’s People




Many people have a negative view of individuals in authority. Who can blame them? Humans have a long history of abusing their authority to benefit themselves. (Mic 7:3) How grateful we are that elders in the congregation are trained to use their authority for the good of Jehovah’s people.​—Es 10:3; Mt 20:25, 26.
Unlike those in authority in this world, elders reach out for positions of oversight out of love for Jehovah and his people. (Joh 21:16; 1Pe 5:1-3) Under Jesus’ direction, these shepherds help each publisher to feel at home among Jehovah’s family of worshippers and to stay close to Jehovah. They are quick to offer spiritual assistance to Jehovah’s sheep and to help when a medical emergency occurs or when a disaster strikes. If you need assistance, why not take the initiative to contact an elder in your congregation?​—Jas 5:14.
