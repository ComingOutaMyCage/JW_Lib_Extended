TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Continue to Show the Depth of Your Love for Jehovah




[Play the video Introduction to Job.]
Satan claimed that Job loved and served Jehovah for selfish interests (Job 1:8-11; w18.02 6 ¶16-17)
Satan claims that we do not truly love Jehovah (Job 2:4, 5; w19.02 5 ¶10)





Jehovah has given each one of us the opportunity to prove Satan a liar. (Pr 27:11) We can show just how much we love Jehovah by keeping him at the center of our lives during good times and bad.
