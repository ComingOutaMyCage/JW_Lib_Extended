<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>3-4.</strong> What concerns did Paul have about the Hebrew Christians in Judea, and how did he help them?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Why did Paul write his letter to the Hebrew Christians in Judea? Likely, for two main reasons. First, to give them encouragement. Most of them had been raised in the Jewish religion. Their former religious leaders may <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>have ridiculed them for becoming Christians. Why? Because Christians had no impressive temple to go to for worship, no physical altar on which to make sacrifices to God, and no priests to minister to them. This could have discouraged Christ’s disciples and caused their faith to weaken. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:1-58:2:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:12-58:3:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:14-58:3:14" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 14</a>) Some of them might even have been tempted to go back to Judaism.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Second, Paul pointed out to those Hebrew Christians that they were not making the effort to understand new or deep spiritual teachings, the “solid food” found in God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:11-58:5:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 5:11-14</a>) Evidently, some of them were still holding on to the Mosaic Law. Paul explained, though, that the sacrifices the Law required could not fully remove sin. For that reason, the Law had been “set aside.” So Paul went on to teach some deeper truths. He reminded his fellow Christians of “a better hope” based on Jesus’ sacrifice that could truly help them draw “near to God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:18-58:7:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 7:18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What do we need to understand from the Bible book of Hebrews, and why?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Paul explained to his Hebrew brothers why their Christian worship was far superior to the worship they offered in the past. The features of the Jewish religion were only “a <strong><em>shadow</em></strong> of the things to come, but the <strong><em>reality</em></strong> belongs to the Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:17-51:2:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 2:17</a>) The shadow that an object casts is only a general shape of the real thing that casts the shadow. So, too, the ancient Jewish pattern of worship was just a shadow of the reality that was to come. We need to understand the arrangement Jehovah has put in place for us to have our sins forgiven so that we can offer acceptable worship. Let us compare the “shadow” (the ancient Jewish pattern) with “the reality” (the Christian way of worship), as explained in Hebrews. By doing so, we can better understand the spiritual temple and how it involves us.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>The ancient pattern.</em></strong> Paul based his discussion on the tabernacle that was set <span id="page26" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>up by Moses in 1512 B.C.E. (See the chart “The Ancient Pattern​—The Christian Reality.”) The tabernacle was a tentlike structure that the Israelites initially carried with them as they moved from place to place. They used it for nearly 500 years until a permanent temple was built in Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:8-2:25:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 25:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:9:22-4:9:22" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Num. 9:22</a>) This “tent of meeting” was the central place for the Israelites to approach God and offer their sacrifices and their worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:43-2:29:46" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 29:43-46</a>) However, the tabernacle also represented something much greater that was to come for Christians.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> When did the spiritual temple become a reality?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>The Christian reality.</em></strong> The ancient tabernacle was “a shadow of the heavenly things,” and it pictured Jehovah’s great spiritual temple. Paul said that “this tent [or, tabernacle] is an illustration for the present time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:5-58:8:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 8:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:9-58:9:9" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 9:9</a>) So by the time he wrote to the Hebrews, the spiritual temple had already become a reality for Christians. It came into existence in 29 C.E. That year, Jesus got baptized, was anointed with holy spirit, and began serving as Jehovah’s “great high priest” in the spiritual temple.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:14-58:4:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 4:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:37-44:10:38" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Acts 10:37, 38</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>The ancient pattern.</em></strong> The high priest was authorized to represent the people before God. Israel’s first high priest, Aaron, was appointed by Jehovah when the tabernacle was inaugurated.

Herein lies a sharp contrast between Israel’s high priests and the great High Priest, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>The Christian reality.</em></strong> As our High Priest, Jesus Christ is “a minister . . . of the true tent, which Jehovah set up, and not man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:1-58:8:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 8:1, 2</a>) Paul explained that “because [Jesus] continues alive forever, his priesthood has no successors.” Paul added that Jesus is “undefiled, separated from the sinners” and that unlike the high priests of Israel, “he does not need to offer up sacrifices daily” for his own sins. Now consider the differences between the altars and the sacrifices in the ancient pattern and those in the Christian reality.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Heb. 10:1-4</a>) The continual sacrifices of animals at the tabernacle pointed to the one sacrifice that would fully redeem humankind.</p>

Inside were two compartments​—“the Holy Place” and “the Most Holy”—​that were separated by an embroidered curtain.

These include approaching Jehovah in prayer, making public declaration of our hope, meeting together as a congregation, and encouraging one another “all the more so as [we] see [Jehovah’s] day drawing near.” Toward the end of the Revelation account, Jehovah’s angel states the following twice for emphasis: “Worship God!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rev. 19:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:9-66:22:9" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 22:9</a>) May we never forget this deep spiritual truth regarding Jehovah’s great spiritual temple and the cherished privilege we have to worship our great God!</p>
