<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IMAGINE that you are deciding whether to buy a house. What would you want to see before you make your decision? Just a photo of the front of the house? No doubt you would want to see the house in person so that you can walk around it, go inside to inspect all the rooms, and see it in all its dimensions. You might even like to examine the plans of the house to find out how it was built. Obviously, you would want to see your future home in all its aspects.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> We can do something similar when we read and study the Bible. One commentary likens the Bible’s message to “a vastly spacious building, with its high towers and deep foundations.” So, then, how can we get familiar with all that is in the Bible? If you just read it quickly, you may learn only basic facts​—“the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12</a>) Instead, as with the house, go “inside” to examine the rich details. An excellent way to study the Bible is to see <strong><em>how</em></strong> the various parts of its message connect together. Endeavor to understand not only <strong><em>what</em></strong> truths you believe but also <strong><em>why</em></strong> you believe them.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What did the apostle Paul urge his fellow Christians to do, and why? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:19" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:14-19</a>)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> To understand God’s Word fully in all its dimensions, <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>we must learn deep Bible truths. The apostle Paul urged his Christian brothers and sisters to study God’s Word diligently so that they could “comprehend fully what is the <strong><em>breadth</em></strong> and <strong><em>length</em></strong> and <strong><em>height</em></strong> and <strong><em>depth”</em></strong> of the truth. Then they would become further “rooted and established” in their faith. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 3:14-19</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> We need to do the same. Let us see how we can explore God’s Word to get a fuller picture of its rich meaning.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> As Christians, we are not content with having only a superficial understanding of the Bible. With the help of God’s holy spirit, we are eager to learn “even the deep things of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:9-46:2:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:9, 10</a>) Why not start a personal study project that will draw you closer to Jehovah? For example, you could explore how he demonstrated his love for his ancient servants and how that proves that he loves you too. You might examine Jehovah’s arrangement for worship in Israel and how that compares with the Christian arrangement today. Or perhaps you could make an in-depth study of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled during his life and ministry on earth.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> (a) What is the difference between a plan and a purpose? (b) Why can it be said that Jehovah’s purpose for man and the earth is “eternal”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:11-49:3:11" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:11</a>)</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider for example what the Bible says about God’s purpose. There is a distinct difference between a plan and a purpose. A <strong><em>plan</em></strong> is like a specific and fixed route that can lead you to your chosen destination. However, the plan can fail when a roadblock appears along the route. A <strong><em>purpose</em></strong> focuses on the destination itself. We know exactly where we want to complete our journey, but the route is not set. It can be adjusted as needed. Thankfully, Jehovah has progressively revealed his “eternal purpose” in the Bible. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070153/3:11">study note on Ephesians 3:11</a>.) One way or another, he always succeeds because he “has made everything work for his purpose.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:4-20:16:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 16:4</a>) And the results of what Jehovah does will endure forever. What is Jehovah’s purpose, and what adjustments has he made in order to accomplish it?</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> After the first humans rebelled, how did Jehovah adjust the way he would achieve his purpose? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:34-40:25:34" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matthew 25:34</a>)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> God told the first humans what his purpose was for them. They were to “be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection . . . every living creature” on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) When Adam and Eve rebelled, causing sin to enter the human family, Jehovah’s purpose was not thwarted. He adjusted the way it would be achieved. Immediately, he determined to set up a Kingdom in heaven that would accomplish his original purpose for mankind and the earth. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:34-40:25:34" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 25:34</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> At his due time, Jehovah lovingly sent his firstborn Son to the earth to teach people about the Kingdom and to give his life to ransom us from sin and death. Then Jesus was resurrected back to heaven to rule as King of God’s Kingdom. But there is more to ponder about God’s purpose.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> The main theme of the Bible is that Jehovah’s name will be vindicated as he fulfills his purpose for the earth by means of his Kingdom under Christ. Jehovah’s purpose cannot be changed. He has guaranteed that he will carry it out with success. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:10-23:46:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 46:10, 11</a>, ftns.; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:17-58:6:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 6:17, 18</a>) In time, the earth will be transformed into a paradise where perfect, righteous descendants of Adam and Eve will “enjoy life forever.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:26-19:22:26" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 22:26</a>) More than that, Jehovah has an even broader purpose in mind. His ultimate purpose is to unite all his intelligent creatures in heaven and on earth. Then all those living will loyally submit to him as their Sovereign. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:8-49:1:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 1:8-11</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Are you not amazed at the beautiful way that Jehovah accomplishes his purpose?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:7-66:20:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 20:7-10</a>) And the Bible reveals much more about what will occur as the enmity between Satan’s system and Jehovah’s organization comes to a climax.</p>
