TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“My Heart Will Always Be There”




Jehovah chose the temple for himself (2Ch 7:11, 12)
Jehovah’s heart would always be there, indicating that he would be highly interested in what went on at this house associated with his name (2Ch 7:16; w02 11/15 5 ¶1)
If the people stopped walking before Jehovah “with all their heart,” he would allow the temple to be destroyed (2Ch 6:14; 7:19-21; it-2 1077-1078)





At the time of the temple’s inauguration, the people likely thought their heart would always be at the temple. Sadly, the people gradually lost their enthusiasm for worshipping Jehovah.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How am I demonstrating that my heart is involved in my worship?’
