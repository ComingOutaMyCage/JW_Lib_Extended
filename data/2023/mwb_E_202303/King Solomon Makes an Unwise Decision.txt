King Solomon Makes an Unwise Decision




[Play the video Introduction to 2 Chronicles.]
Solomon accumulated horses and chariots from Egypt (De 17:15, 16; 2Ch 1:14, 17)
People and cities were needed to accommodate Solomon’s new military divisions (2Ch 1:14; it-1 174 ¶5; 427)
Although the people prospered during a good part of Solomon’s reign, they revolted under King Rehoboam because he kept his father’s heavy burdens and added to them. (2Ch 10:3, 4, 14, 16) Our decisions always have consequences.​—Ga 6:7.
