The queen of Sheba visiting the court of King Solomon



TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
She Valued Wisdom




The queen of Sheba made a long and arduous trip to see Solomon (2Ch 9:1, 2; w99 11/1 20 ¶4; w99 7/1 30 ¶4-5)
Solomon’s wisdom and riches left her breathless (2Ch 9:3, 4; w99 7/1 30-31; see cover picture)
What she saw moved her to praise Jehovah (2Ch 9:7, 8; it-2 990-991)





The queen of Sheba valued wisdom so much that she was willing to make great sacrifices to obtain it.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘Am I willing to search for wisdom as I would for hidden treasures?’​—Pr 2:1-6.
