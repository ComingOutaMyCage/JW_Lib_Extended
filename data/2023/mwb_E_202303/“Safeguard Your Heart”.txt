LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
“Safeguard Your Heart”


Solomon wrote under inspiration: “Above all the things that you guard, safeguard your heart.” (Pr 4:23) Sadly, God’s people, Israel, stopped walking before Jehovah “with all their heart.” (2Ch 6:14) Even King Solomon allowed his pagan wives to incline his heart to follow other gods. (1Ki 11:4) How can you safeguard your heart? That was the subject of the study article that appeared in the January 2019 issue of The Watchtower, pages 14-19.
