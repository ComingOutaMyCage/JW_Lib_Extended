How to Use the Bible Study Videos




We have four Bible study videos for use in the ministry. For what purpose was each one designed?





Why Study the Bible?​—Full Length was designed to stimulate interest in the Bible regardless of a person’s religious beliefs. It encourages viewers to look into the Bible for answers to life’s big questions and gives a sample of the logical information found there. It explains how to request a Bible study.






Why Study the Bible? (shortened version) is similar to the full-length version but is about a third of the length. It may be more effective in territories where people are in a hurry.






What Happens at a Bible Study? was designed to stimulate interest in our free Bible study program and to answer some common questions about it, including how to request a study.






Welcome to Your Bible Study was designed to be shown to Bible students. Although the video is introduced on page two of the Enjoy Life Forever! book, it may be shown when discussing the Enjoy Life Forever! brochure. The video outlines the contents of the book and what the student can expect during discussions.


Although each video was designed for a particular purpose, any of them may be shown or sent to people when appropriate. Publishers are encouraged to become well-acquainted with and make good use of them in the ministry.
