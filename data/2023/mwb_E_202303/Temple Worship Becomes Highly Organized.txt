TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Temple Worship Becomes Highly Organized




King David organized the Levites and the priests for temple duty (1Ch 23:6, 27, 28; 24:1, 3; it-2 241, 686)
Expert musicians and learners were assigned to musical service (1Ch 25:1, 8; it-2 451-452)
Levites were assigned as gatekeepers, treasurers, and other officials (1Ch 26:16-20; it-1 898)





Worship that is organized reflects Jehovah’s personality.​—1Co 14:33.
FOR MEDITATION: How is the Christian congregation well-organized for worship today?
