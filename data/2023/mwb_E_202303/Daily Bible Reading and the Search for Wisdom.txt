LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Daily Bible Reading and the Search for Wisdom


Godly wisdom is precious like hidden treasure. (Pr 2:1-6) Wisdom helps us to have sound judgment and make good decisions. It protects and safeguards us. Therefore, it is “the most important thing.” (Pr 4:5-7) Effort is required to dig for the spiritual treasures hidden in God’s Word. We can begin by reading God’s Word “day and night”​—every day. (Jos 1:8) Note some suggestions that can help us to read God’s Word regularly and to enjoy it.
