TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Rely On Jehovah​—When?




Asa relied on Jehovah to defeat a large army (2Ch 14:9-12; w21.03 5 ¶12)
Asa later counted on the Syrians to defeat a smaller army (2Ch 16:1-3; w21.03 5 ¶13)
Jehovah was displeased with Asa for not continuing to seek His help (2Ch 16:7-9)





We may rely on Jehovah when making life-altering decisions, but what about at other times? It is important to take notice of Jehovah in all our ways.​—Pr 3:5, 6; w21.03 6 ¶14.
