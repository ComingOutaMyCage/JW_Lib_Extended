TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Benefit From Wise Advice




Rehoboam was faced with a decision (2Ch 10:1-4; w18.06 13 ¶3)
Rehoboam sought advice (2Ch 10:6-11; w01 9/1 28-29)
Rehoboam and the people suffered because he rejected wise advice (2Ch 10:12-16; it-2 768 ¶1)





Because of their experience, older, spiritually mature ones can often perceive how a situation will likely turn out.​—Job 12:12.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘From whom in the congregation would I receive good advice?’
