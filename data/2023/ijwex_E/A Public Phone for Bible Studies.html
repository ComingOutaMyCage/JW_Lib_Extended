<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Daiane is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and a full-time evangelizer in Brazil. One day, while sharing the Bible’s message by telephone, she talked to a young married couple who showed interest. They told Daiane that they would be moving to an isolated village that had no electricity or Internet access. In addition, none of Jehovah’s Witnesses live there. To continue their Bible discussions, the couple gave Daiane the number of a public telephone in the village, and the three of them agreed on a day and time when they could talk.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>At the agreed time, Daiane called the public phone and the couple answered! Over the next two weeks, they had three more Bible discussions with Daiane over the phone.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>After that, though, the couple did not answer her calls. Undeterred, Daiane continued to call the public phone three times a week, and she discussed the Bible with the person who answered. As a result, Daiane was able to start several Bible studies with people in the village.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>One day, while Daiane and her husband were conducting a Bible study with a young man on the public phone, a church leader in the village overheard the discussion. He stood beside the Bible student to hear the conversation better. Then the church leader asked to speak with Daiane and her husband. He had enjoyed what he heard so much that he wanted a Bible study too!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>In time, Daiane and her husband were conducting six Bible studies over the phone in the isolated village, including one with the church leader. Some of the students have already attended Christian meetings by telephone tie-in, using the same public phone. One of them even made a bench so that the students would have a place to sit during their study.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Daiane and her husband are grateful for the opportunity they have had to spread the Kingdom message in this remote village. Daiane says, “Jehovah can arrange for the good news to reach anyone, even if he lives in an isolated place.”</p>
