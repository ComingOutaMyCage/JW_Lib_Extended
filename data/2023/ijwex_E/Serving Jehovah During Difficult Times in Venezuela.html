A Witness named Edgar says, “Within just a few years, the standard of living dropped so drastically that it felt as if we had moved to another country, without even leaving home!”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>What helped Edgar adapt? He says: “My wife, Carmen, and I thought about the example of missionaries who moved to lands with limited resources and learned to do without even basic services. That motivated us to simplify our life and to take on new challenges, such as growing our own food.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>) Edgar says, “More than just consoling them, we tried to encourage them to experience the joy of helping still others in need.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

A Witness from a nearby town gave them digital recordings of the program. Then Argenis’ relatives borrowed a large-screen TV and speakers. Argenis phoned them before the program to say a prayer with them. Because of Argenis’ diligent efforts, 4 of his relatives and 15 others were able to attend.</p>
