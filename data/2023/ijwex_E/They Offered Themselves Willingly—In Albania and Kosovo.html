<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Before moving, they took steps to expand their ministry, and this helped with the challenges of serving abroad. Gwen says: “I first joined an Albanian-speaking group in my hometown. Then I visited Albania for a convention. Later, I returned there for a little while to learn the language better.”</p>

She says: “The brother giving the report said that publishers in Albania were starting many Bible studies and that interested ones came to the meetings. I began to tell my parents that I wanted to go to Albania. My desire took them by surprise, but my dad said, ‘Pray about it, and if it is Jehovah’s will, he will listen.’ A few months later, we were invited as a family to serve in Albania!” Many years have passed, and Federica is now married to Orges. They serve together as full-time ministers in Albania.</p>

Our hearts were touched by a <em>Watchtower</em> article entitled ‘<a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:2009925/">Can You Step Over Into Macedonia?</a>’ We sat down to figure out how to use my pension to serve in Albania.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:28-42:14:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 14:28</a>) Among other things, they have to find ways to support themselves. While still in England, Gwen, mentioned earlier, first moved in with her sister to save money. Sophia and Christopher, also from England, recall: “We sold our car and some furniture. We were hoping to be able to stay in Albania for at least one year.” Happily, they were able to remain much longer.</p>

This was the case with Eliseo and Miriam. Eliseo explains: “Miriam is originally from a tourist spot in Italy, where it was very easy to find seasonal jobs. We would go to that area and work three months in the summer and then live in Albania on our savings for the remaining nine months. We did this for five years.”</p>

Sophia, mentioned earlier, says: “During winter in Albania, houses are much colder than what I was used to back home. I learned to dress differently by watching how local sisters dressed.” Grzegorz and his wife, Sona, came from Poland to help in the picturesque town of Prizren, in Kosovo.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Grzegorz says: “Local publishers are so humble, kind, and patient!

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Those who move abroad benefit from forming close friendships with local Witnesses and getting to know their background. Sona explains: “I have seen how powerful Jehovah’s love is. The brothers build my faith because I see how they completely changed their beliefs and their lives when they learned about Jehovah. In the congregation, we feel needed, and we see our place in it. We serve alongside brothers and sisters who have become our friends.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:29-41:10:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 10:29, 30</a>) Gloria says: “I know many sisters who endured violent opposition from anti-Witness members of the community.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Need-greaters also have the opportunity to learn valuable lessons they may not have learned at home. For example, they see that stepping out of one’s comfort zone to do more for Jehovah brings joy. Stefano puts it this way: “In my home country, I preached mostly by intercom, using brief presentations. But Albanians love to talk at length, especially while sipping coffee. As I am very shy, at first I was embarrassed, and I did not know what to say. However, over time, I learned to take an interest in people, and now I enjoy conversing with them. My preaching is much more satisfying.”</p>

She comments: “Serving here has opened our minds and broadened our perspective. We have learned so much about hospitality, respect, and friendship! We have learned new ways to preach, reason from the Scriptures, and express ourselves.” William says: “Most people who visit Albania fall in love with the gorgeous beaches. I personally like hiking in the rugged Albanian Alps. But it is the people who really make me love it here! Many villages in our territory have had only a brief witness during special campaigns. When we go there, we sometimes spend a whole day just speaking with a couple of families.”</p>

In just two and a half years, 120 new ones qualified to preach to others! I studied with 16 of them!” Another sister, Sandra, remembers: “I witnessed to a woman working at the market. She became a sister and moved back to her home village. At last count, she had started 15 Bible studies!”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Some need-greaters who moved to Albania years ago are still there and enjoy their service very much. They sometimes marvel when they see that their work bore fruit long after they planted the first seed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:6-21:11:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>) Christopher, mentioned earlier, states: “I ran into a man with whom I had started a Bible study when I first moved to Albania. I was touched when he recounted in detail our early conversations about the Bible. Now both he and his wife are baptized servants of Jehovah.” Federica, mentioned before, comments: “In one congregation, a sister approached me and asked me if I remembered her. She told me that I had preached to her nine years earlier. Some time after I moved to another town, she had started studying the Bible and progressed to baptism. I used to think that our first years in Albania did not yield results. I was wrong!”</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>Brothers and sisters who moved to Albania or Kosovo are grateful to see how Jehovah has blessed their efforts and given them a rewarding life. After many years in Albania, Eliseo summarizes his experience, saying: “As humans, we are easily fooled into thinking that we can achieve stability by relying on what this world considers stable. But it is an illusion. Jehovah’s principles, on the other hand, give us purpose and stability. My service as a need-greater helps me remember that. I feel useful and appreciated. I have true friends around me that work toward the same goals.” Sandra agrees: “When I moved to where the need is greater, I felt that Jehovah had given me the opportunity to fulfill my long-held desire—to be a missionary. I have never regretted moving to Albania. I’ve never been happier.”</p>
