<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Brooke is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses who lives in the United States. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she preached by writing letters. In fact, Brooke wrote many letters each week. However, after a year and a half, she felt discouraged. Up until then, only one person had responded—and he told her never to write to him again. Brooke doubted that her efforts were making a difference.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>In time, however, Kim, a fellow Witness who works at a bank, told Brooke about a conversation she had with a customer. The customer told Kim about a handwritten letter he had received from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. As it turned out, he was referring to one of Brooke’s letters! The following week the customer returned to the bank. While he was talking with Kim, he asked if he could attend our congregation meetings, which at the time were being held via videoconferencing.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>A short time later, David, another Witness, told Brooke about a coworker who had received one of her letters. This coworker was deeply impressed that the letter was handwritten. He said: “More people should show this type of personal interest in others.” David took the opportunity to give a further witness and offered to bring literature to his coworker, which the man gratefully accepted.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:5-21:11:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:5, 6</a>) Nevertheless, Brooke’s experiences gave her renewed appreciation for her part in the Christian ministry.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>.</p>
