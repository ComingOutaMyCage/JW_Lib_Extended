<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What does today’s text mean? As Jesus went on to explain, this is self-sacrificing love​—love that moves a Christian even to die for a fellow believer if necessary. God’s Word places a lot of emphasis on love. Many people include among their favorite Bible verses the following: “God is love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 22:39</a>) “Love covers a multitude of sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:8</a>) “Love never fails.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:8-46:13:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:8</a>) These verses and others should make it plain to anyone how important it is to cultivate and display this beautiful quality. Genuine love comes from Jehovah​—from having his spirit and blessing on a group of worshippers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:7-62:4:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 4:7</a>) Is it any wonder, then, that Jesus said that unselfish love would identify his true followers? Just as Jesus foretold, many have recognized his true followers by the genuine love they show among themselves. <a class="xt" data-xtid="38" href="jwpub://p/E:2023326/11-14"><em>w23.03</em> 27-28 ¶5-8</a></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Do you need to be more forgiving of others? You might begin by reading about and meditating on Bible examples of those who freely forgave others and those who did not. Consider Jesus’ example. He willingly forgave others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:47-42:7:47" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 7:47</a>) He also looked past their faults and saw their potential. By contrast, the Pharisees in Jesus’ day “considered others as nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:9-42:18:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 18:9</a>) After meditating on these examples, ask yourself: ‘What do I see in others? Which of their qualities do I choose to focus on?’ If you are struggling to forgive someone, try writing down as many of that individual’s good qualities as you can. Then ask yourself: ‘How does Jesus view this person? Would he forgive him?’ Such a study project could help to readjust our thinking. At first, we may have to work hard to forgive someone who has offended us. But if we keep working at it, in time we will become more willing to forgive. <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:2022362/12-12"><em>w22.04</em> 23 ¶6</a></p>

If you are sometimes discouraged by a limitation, ask yourself, ‘What does Jehovah require of me?’ Your best​—whatever that may be right now. Consider this scenario: A sister in her 80’s feels discouraged because she cannot do as much in the ministry as she did when she was in her 40’s. She thinks that even though she is giving her best, it is not pleasing to Jehovah. But is that really the case? Think about it. If this sister gave her best in her 40’s and she is still giving her best in her 80’s, she has never stopped giving her best. If we do our best, Jehovah will in effect say to us: “Well done!” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:20-40:25:23" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 25:20-23</a>.)

When the Bible speaks of offspring in a figurative sense, it is referring to those who think and act like their symbolic father. So the offspring of the serpent is made up of spirit creatures and humans who, like Satan, resist Jehovah God and oppose His people. That would include the angels who abandoned their assignments in heaven in Noah’s day as well as wicked humans who behave like their father the Devil.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:2" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Gen. 6:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> John 8:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> 1 John 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:6-65:1:6" data-bid="53-4" class="b"> Jude 6</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="50" href="jwpub://p/E:2022485/10-11"><em>w22.07</em> 14-15 ¶4-5</a></p>

He was no stranger to hardship; thus, he could show compassion and empathy for fellow believers when they were going through trials. One time, Paul ran out of funds and had to find work to support himself and his companions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:34-44:20:34" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Acts 20:34</a>) He was a tentmaker by trade. When he arrived in Corinth, he at first worked with fellow tentmakers Aquila and Priscilla. But “every sabbath” he would preach to the Jews and the Greeks. Then when Silas and Timothy arrived, “Paul began to be intensely occupied with the word.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:2-44:18:5" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Acts 18:2-5</a>) Paul never lost sight of his main purpose in life, to serve Jehovah. Hardworking Paul was in a good position to encourage his brothers and sisters. He reminded them not to allow the pressures of life and the need to provide for the family to cause them to neglect “the more important things”​—all aspects of Jehovah’s worship. <a class="xt" data-xtid="51" href="jwpub://p/E:2022525/9-9"><em>w22.08</em> 20 ¶3</a></p>

That sovereign from a distant land traveled to Jerusalem to see the situation for herself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:1-11:10:1" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:1</a>) After inspecting Solomon’s kingdom, she said the words above. But the conditions under Solomon’s rule were just a taste of what Jehovah will do for mankind under the rule of His Son, Jesus. Jesus is superior to Solomon in every way. Solomon was an imperfect man who made serious errors in judgment that eventually brought hardship on God’s people. Jesus, on the other hand, is a perfect Ruler who makes no mistakes.

We should obey emergency regulations, such as those regarding washing our hands, social distancing, wearing a mask, and quarantining. Our diligence in these areas shows how deeply we appreciate God’s gift of life. During emergencies, inaccurate information may circulate among friends, among neighbors, and in the media. Rather than believe “every word” we hear, we do well to listen to the most reliable governmental and medical sources available.

By being cooperative, we protect ourselves and others from harm. We may also enhance the congregation’s reputation in the community.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="102-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="69" href="jwpub://p/E:2023286/20-21"><em>w23.02</em> 23 ¶11-12</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">When the Israelites entered the Promised Land, they settled over a wide area. Israelites living in one area could easily have lost interest in the welfare of fellow Israelites living in other parts of the country. But Jehovah arranged for the Israelites to gather together on various occasions to hear his written Word read and explained. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:10-5:31:12" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Deut. 31:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:2-16:8:2" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> Neh. 8:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:8-16:8:8" data-bid="104-3" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:18-16:8:18" data-bid="104-4" class="b"> 18</a>) Imagine how a faithful Israelite must have felt as he arrived in Jerusalem and saw perhaps millions of his fellow worshippers from every part of the country! Jehovah thereby helped his people to remain united. Later, when the Christian congregation was formed, it was made up of men and women who spoke many languages and who were from many social and economic backgrounds. But they were united in worship of the true God. Those who became believers could understand God’s Word only with the aid of fellow worshippers and by meeting together with them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:42-44:2:42" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Acts 2:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:30-44:8:31" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> 8:30, 31</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="70" href="jwpub://p/E:2023280/13-13"><em>w23.02</em> 3 ¶7</a></p>

Just think: Our heavenly Father loves us so deeply that we will never be separated from him. God’s promise of everlasting life helps us to endure our current trials. Even when our enemies threaten us with death, we will not compromise. Why? In part because we know that if we die faithful to Jehovah, he will raise us from the dead with the prospect of never dying.

However, he does help us to endure them. Note what the apostle Paul said to Christians living in Rome. He first listed a number of trials that he and his brothers were facing.
