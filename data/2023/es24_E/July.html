(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-4</a>) Adam misused his tongue when he blamed Eve​—and even Jehovah—​for his own mistakes.

Students hear profanity at school, and adults are exposed to it in the workplace. If not careful, we might get so used to hearing bad language that we begin to use it ourselves. Of course, as Christians, we want to please Jehovah, and that involves more than avoiding obscene speech. We want to use the remarkable gift of speech in a positive way​—to praise our God. <a class="xt" data-xtid="208" href="jwpub://p/E:2022367/6-8"><em>w22.04</em> 4 ¶1-3</a></p>

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus drew the attention of his disciples to two aspects of creation that many people take for granted: sunshine and rain. Both of these are essential for the preservation of life. Jehovah could have withheld these from undeserving humans. Instead, he lovingly provides the sun and the rain for all. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:43-40:5:45" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 5:43-45</a>) Jesus used this lesson to teach his disciples that Jehovah wants us to show love toward everyone.

He knew that the prophetic words of the psalmist would be fulfilled: “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) If you are sharing in the preaching work, you are supporting Jesus and the faithful slave and are helping to fulfill that prophecy. The work is going ahead, but there are challenges. One challenge that Kingdom preachers face is opposition. Apostates, religious leaders, and politicians have given many the wrong impression about our work. If our relatives, acquaintances, and workmates are misled by this propaganda, they may pressure us to stop serving Jehovah and to stop preaching. In some countries, the opposition takes the form of intimidation, threats, arrests, and even imprisonment. <a class="xt" data-xtid="52" href="jwpub://p/E:2022481/6-6"><em>w22.07</em> 8 ¶1;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="223" href="jwpub://p/E:2022481/11-12"> 9 ¶5-6</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) He also spoke of an “increasing of lawlessness,” which is evident in crime, violence, and terrorist attacks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Matt. 24:12</a>) Jesus never said that these calamities would impact only those whom Jehovah has abandoned. In fact, many of Jehovah’s faithful servants have been victims of disasters.

We will find this easier if we have planned in advance how to respond. But does preparing indicate that we lack faith in Jehovah? Not at all. In fact, preparing for a disaster shows that we do have faith in his ability to care for us. How so? God’s Word advises us to prepare for potential disasters. <a class="xt" data-xtid="236" href="jwpub://p/E:2022686/16-17"><em>w22.12</em> 18 ¶9-10</a></p>

When the king learned that Joseph had the ability to interpret dreams, he sent for him. With Jehovah’s help, Joseph interpreted the dreams and impressed Pharaoh with the practical advice he gave him. Seeing that Jehovah was with the young man, Pharaoh appointed Joseph as the food administrator for all of Egypt.

Joseph was now in a position to save his family and thus preserve the line of descent that would lead to the Messiah. Obviously, it was Jehovah who made everything Joseph did succeed. In the end, Jehovah turned the cruel scheme of Joseph’s brothers into a means by which He could accomplish His will. <a class="xt" data-xtid="237" href="jwpub://p/E:2023242/18-19"><em>w23.01</em> 17 ¶11-12</a></p>

It was at the time of his baptism and his being anointed with holy spirit that Jesus’ memory of his prehuman existence was evidently restored to him. In his first recorded words after his baptism and in some of his last words before his death, Jesus quoted from the Scriptures.
