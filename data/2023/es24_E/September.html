She did not criticize people behind their back, she spoke in a positive way, and she did not use profanity. Kimberly’s classmate was intrigued and eventually agreed to a Bible study.

Think about the amazing visions that Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and John received. They all depict Jehovah as a majestic King. Isaiah “saw Jehovah sitting on a lofty and elevated throne.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:1-23:6:3" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Isa. 6:1-3</a>) Ezekiel saw Jehovah seated on his celestial chariot, surrounded by “a brilliance . . . like that of a rainbow.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:26-26:1:28" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:26-28</a>) Daniel saw “the Ancient of Days” clothed in white garments, with flames of fire coming from His throne. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:10" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Dan. 7:9, 10</a>) And John saw Jehovah seated on a throne surrounded by something like a beautiful emerald-green rainbow. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:2-66:4:4" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Rev. 4:2-4</a>) As we reflect on Jehovah’s incomparable glory, we are reminded of the incredible privilege of approaching him in prayer and the importance of doing so with reverence. <a class="xt" data-xtid="291" href="jwpub://p/E:2022486/8-8"><em>w22.07</em> 20 ¶3</a></p>

One way he may do that is by raising doubts in your mind about some of the Bible’s teachings. For example, sooner or later you will come across the God-dishonoring theory of evolution. You may have given little or no thought to the subject when you were younger, but now that you are older, perhaps you are confronted with it directly in school. What your teachers say in support of evolution may seem logical and convincing. However, they may have never seriously considered the evidence of the existence of a Creator. Remember the principle found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:17-20:18:17" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:17</a>: “The first to state his case seems right, until the other party comes and cross-examines him.” Instead of blindly accepting ideas that you hear at school as fact, carefully consider the truths found in God’s Word, the Bible and in our publications. <a class="xt" data-xtid="292" href="jwpub://p/E:2022520/7-7"><em>w22.08</em> 2 ¶2;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="293" href="jwpub://p/E:2022520/14-14"> 4 ¶8</a></p>

How do you read?” The man was able to give the right answer by quoting the scriptures about loving God and loving neighbor.

That hope can help us to remain loyal during these difficult last days. But to please Jehovah, we must be motivated by more than just a desire to stay alive. Our primary reason for remaining loyal to Jehovah and Jesus is that we love them deeply. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="94-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>) That love motivates us to imitate them and to share with others the hope we have. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:15" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Rom. 10:13-15</a>) As we learn to be unselfish and generous, we become the type of people whom Jehovah wants as his friends forever. <a class="xt" data-xtid="306" href="jwpub://p/E:2022680/24-25"><em>w22.12</em> 6-7 ¶15-16</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:1-43:16:2" data-bid="97-1" class="b">John 16:1, 2</a>) While Jesus did tell us to expect persecution, he also assured us that we can remain faithful.

These are meant to protect us, to make sure that we keep receiving spiritual food, and to help us continue preaching to the extent possible. Do your best to obey the direction you receive. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Jas. 3:17</a>) Also, never reveal information about our brothers and sisters to those who are not entitled to it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="307" href="jwpub://p/E:2022686/22-24"><em>w22.12</em> 20-21 ¶14-16</a></p>

Through Jehovah’s organization, Jesus trains us how to preach and he provides us with the tools we need to spread the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>) We do our part by being industrious in our preaching and teaching work and by keeping watchful as we wait on Jehovah to bring an end to this system of things. By applying the counsel found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:11-58:6:12" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:11, 12</a>, we will hold fast to our hope “down to the end.” Jehovah has a fixed day and hour when he will bring an end to Satan’s system. When that day comes, Jehovah will without fail fulfill the prophecies that he had recorded in his Word. Meanwhile, it may at times seem that the end of this system has been delayed. However, Jehovah’s day “will not be late!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Hab. 2:3</a>) So may we be determined to “keep on the lookout for Jehovah,” showing “a waiting attitude for the God of [our] salvation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:7-33:7:7" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Mic. 7:7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="308" href="jwpub://p/E:2023285/23-24"><em>w23.02</em> 19 ¶15-16</a></p>

In a similar way, regularly take time to stop and think about how Jehovah is making you successful even while you are enduring a hardship. At the end of each day, ask yourself: ‘In what way did I see Jehovah’s blessing today? Although the trial is still running its course, how is Jehovah helping me to endure?’ See if you can identify at least one blessing from Jehovah that has made you successful. True, you might be praying for your trial to end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:6" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6</a>) But we should also be aware of the blessings we have right now.

Then you will see how Jehovah is helping you to succeed, even during times of trial.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:51-1:41:52" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Gen. 41:51, 52</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="309" href="jwpub://p/E:2023242/26-27"><em>w23.01</em> 19 ¶17-18</a></p>
