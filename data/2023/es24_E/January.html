If a disaster occurs in a more distant location, you can still help. How? By praying for those affected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:8-47:1:11" data-bid="98-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:8-11</a>) You may be able to support the relief work financially by donating to the worldwide work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:2-47:8:5" data-bid="99-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:2-5</a>) If you are able to travel to an affected area to help, ask the elders about volunteering. If you are invited to do so, you will likely receive some training so that you can be used where and when you are most needed. <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:2022687/15-15"><em>w22.12</em> 24 ¶8;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:2022687/18-19"> 25 ¶11-12</a></p>

Some had formerly been adulterers, homosexuals, and drunkards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="101-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9-11</a>) Do you think that after their baptism they never had any improper desires to contend with? That could not be the case. They were all anointed Christians, true, but they were still imperfect humans. No doubt they had to struggle with improper desires from time to time. That should be encouraging to us. Why? Because it shows that whatever improper desire you are battling, someone else has resisted it. Indeed, you can remain “firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:9-60:5:9" data-bid="102-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:9</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="30" href="jwpub://p/E:2023241/23-23"><em>w23.01</em> 12 ¶15</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:1-40:12:7" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Matt. 12:1-7</a>) On that occasion, the Pharisees claimed that Jesus’ disciples had violated the Sabbath. In reply, Jesus cited two Scriptural examples and quoted a verse from Hosea to show that the Pharisees had missed the point of the Sabbath law and had failed to show mercy. Why were these men not molded by their reading of God’s Word? Because they read it with a critical and proud spirit. Their attitude kept them from getting the sense of what they read.

We dispose of sharp objects, toxic chemicals, or medicines in a safe way, and we keep such items out of the reach of young children. We are cautious when handling open flames, hot liquids, and power tools, not leaving them unattended. We do not drive a car while our judgment is impaired by medication, alcohol, or lack of sleep, or allow ourselves to be distracted by using a handheld device while driving. <a class="xt" data-xtid="34" href="jwpub://p/E:2023286/14-17"><em>w23.02</em> 21-22 ¶7-9</a></p>
