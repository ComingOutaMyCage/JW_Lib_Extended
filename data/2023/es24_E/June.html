Not because we want to work out the “day and hour” when Jehovah will bring Armageddon, but because we want to use the time we have left to perform “holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Matt. 24:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:40-42:12:40" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> Luke 12:40</a>) We want to maintain upright conduct and make sure that our efforts in Jehovah’s service reflect our deep love for him. To keep that focus, we must pay attention to ourselves. <a class="xt" data-xtid="200" href="jwpub://p/E:2023285/10-10"><em>w23.02</em> 16 ¶4,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="201" href="jwpub://p/E:2023285/12-12"> 6</a></p>

For instance, we show our affection for him by the way we treat his spirit-anointed brothers. Jesus said that he would judge the sheep on that basis. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:40" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-40</a>) We can support them in the preaching and disciple-making work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>) We do not need to wait until we are living in Paradise to become the kind of person that Jehovah wants there. Right now we can work at being honest in our speech and actions and moderate in our habits. And we can be loyal to Jehovah, to our marriage mate, and to fellow Christians. The more closely we conform to God’s standards while living in this wicked world, the easier it will be for us to live by them in Paradise. We can also develop skills and traits to show that we are preparing to live then. <a class="xt" data-xtid="202" href="jwpub://p/E:2022681/23-25"><em>w22.12</em> 11-12 ¶14-16</a></p>

He also made it possible for us to enjoy the variety of his creation by means of our five senses​—sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. The Bible reveals another important reason why we should examine creation. It teaches us about Jehovah’s qualities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>) For instance, consider the designs that are so obviously present in nature. Do they not reveal God’s wisdom? And think about the variety of foods we can enjoy. That is clear proof of his love for mankind. When we perceive Jehovah’s personality from the things he made, we come to know him better and we are moved to draw closer to him. <a class="xt" data-xtid="205" href="jwpub://p/E:2023324/10-11"><em>w23.03</em> 16 ¶4-5</a></p>

He was about to undergo a difficult trial of his own; yet, he was concerned about the welfare of his apostles. In imitation of Jesus, we do not focus only on our own needs. Instead, we regularly pray for our brothers and sisters. When we do that, we are obeying Jesus’ command to love one another and we show Jehovah just how much we love our fellow believers.
