<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Profanity has no place on a Christian’s lips. But there are subtle forms of abusive speech that we also need to be on guard against. For example, we need to be careful not to make unfavorable comparisons when talking about people of other cultures, tribes, or nationalities. Further, we never want to hurt others with cutting remarks. Speak in a way that builds others up. Be quick to commend rather than to criticize or complain. The Israelites had much to be thankful for, yet they routinely complained. A complaining spirit can be contagious. You will recall that a negative report from ten spies caused “all the Israelites . . . to murmur against Moses.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:31-4:14:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 13:31–14:4</a>) On the other hand, commendation can be a powerful force for good.

Arrange to work with them in the ministry. Be patient with them, giving them the opportunity to demonstrate that they are trustworthy.

A person who willfully schemes to do something wicked and knows full well that he is doing something that is offensive to Jehovah sins in a serious way.

Yes! Jehovah also considers whether the sinner is sincerely repentant. To repent means “to change one’s mind, attitude, or purpose.” It includes the idea that a person feels regret and deep sadness about the bad things he has done or about not doing the right things he should have done. A repentant person is grieved not only by the wrongs he has committed but also by the poor spiritual condition that led to those wrongs. <a class="xt" data-xtid="367" href="jwpub://p/E:2022440/23-25"><em>w22.06</em> 5-6 ¶15-17</a></p>

<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">One way that you can learn what your brothers and sisters need is by drawing them out with tactful questions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:5-20:20:5" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Prov. 20:5</a>) Do they have enough food, medicine, and other supplies? Are they at risk of losing their job or even their home? Do they need assistance with applying for government aid? Jehovah invites all of us to encourage and help others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>) Even a small expression of our love can have a powerful effect on someone who is ill. A child could send a card or a drawing to encourage a brother. A young adult might be able to run an errand or shop for a sister. What about preparing a meal for someone who is ill? Some Witnesses have sent a thank-you note to the elders, who are often busier than ever during a disease outbreak. How good it is when we do our part to “keep encouraging one another and building one another up”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="105-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="372" href="jwpub://p/E:2022687/8-8"><em>w22.12</em> 22 ¶2;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="373" href="jwpub://p/E:2022687/11-12"> 23 ¶5-6</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">The Sadducees were thoroughly familiar with the first five books of the Hebrew Scriptures, but they overlooked important truths contained in those inspired books. For example, consider how Jesus responded when the Sadducees challenged him about the resurrection. He asked them: “Have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account about the thornbush, that God said to him: ‘I am the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob’?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:18-41:12:18" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Mark 12:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:26-41:12:26" data-bid="107-2" class="b"> 26</a>) Although the Sadducees had surely read that passage many times, Jesus’ question revealed that they had overlooked an important Scriptural truth​—the teaching of the resurrection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:38-42:20:38" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Luke 20:38</a>) What lesson is there for us? When we read, we want to be alert to all that a verse or a Bible account can teach us. We want to perceive not only basic teachings but also deeper truths and principles that lie hidden beneath the surface. <a class="xt" data-xtid="374" href="jwpub://p/E:2023281/16-17"><em>w23.02</em> 11 ¶9-10</a></p>

As a result, we may feel frustrated and sad. But never should we give up and neglect our health. Why not? Because no matter how old or how sick we are, we can still praise Jehovah, as did King David.
