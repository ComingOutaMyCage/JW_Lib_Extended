Consider: The Ethiopian man “had gone to Jerusalem to worship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:27-44:8:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 8:27</a>) He must therefore have been a Jewish proselyte; he had converted to Judaism. No doubt he had learned about Jehovah from the sacred writings of the Hebrew Scriptures. Still, he was eager to learn more. In fact, when Philip met that official on the road, he found him poring over a scroll of the prophet Isaiah’s writings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:28-44:8:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 8:28</a>) He wanted to keep learning.

What is the lesson for us? We must not let fear of man intimidate us or prevent us from supporting our brothers who are being persecuted. Instead, let us defend them and come to their aid. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Prov. 17:17</a>) They need our love and support. Consider how our brothers and sisters in Russia have come to the aid of their dear fellow believers who are imprisoned. When some are put on trial, many brothers and sisters come to the court to support them. What is the lesson for us? When responsible brothers are defamed, arrested, or persecuted, do not become intimidated. Pray for them, care for their family members, and look for other practical ways to show your support.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:5-44:12:5" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Acts 12:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:10-47:1:11" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 1:10, 11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="405" href="jwpub://p/E:2022644/18-19"><em>w22.11</em> 17 ¶11-12</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:2</a>) In the face of a disaster, elders should first make sure that each brother and sister is safe and has food, clothing, and shelter. But for many months thereafter, survivors will likely need spiritual and emotional support. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:15" data-bid="105-1" class="b">John 21:15</a>) “It takes time to recover,” says Harold, who serves on a Branch Committee and who has met with many brothers and sisters affected by disasters. “They may begin to get over their losses, but memories of a lost loved one, a treasured heirloom, or a narrow escape can persist. These memories may trigger feelings of grief all over again. That is not a lack of faith but a normal human reaction.” Elders take to heart the counsel to “weep with those who weep.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:15-45:12:15" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Rom. 12:15</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="406" href="jwpub://p/E:2022687/6-6"><em>w22.12</em> 22 ¶1;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="407" href="jwpub://p/E:2022687/17-18"> 24-25 ¶10-11</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">To help us win the fight to do what is right, Jehovah generously provides his holy spirit. When we study God’s Word, we are placing ourselves under the influence of that spirit. We also receive holy spirit when we attend our meetings. At those Christian gatherings, we can spend time with brothers and sisters who, like us, are trying hard to do what is right, and that is encouraging. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="108-2" class="b"> 13:7</a>) And when we approach Jehovah in earnest prayer and beg him for help with some weakness, he will give us his holy spirit to strengthen us to keep fighting. While these activities will probably not make wrong desires disappear, they will help us resist the urge to act on those desires. Once we have established a wholesome routine of spiritual activities, it is essential that we maintain that routine and keep cultivating proper desires. <a class="xt" data-xtid="408" href="jwpub://p/E:2023241/21-22"><em>w23.01</em> 11 ¶13-14</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Although the Bible is not a health-care book or a dietary manual, it does reveal Jehovah’s thinking in these areas.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:10-21:11:10" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:10</a>) Gluttony and drunkenness, both life-threatening, are condemned in the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:20-20:23:20" data-bid="111-1" class="b">Prov. 23:20</a>) Jehovah expects us to exercise self-control when deciding what and how much to eat and drink. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:25-46:9:25" data-bid="112-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:25</a>) We can make decisions that show deep appreciation for God’s gift of life by using our thinking ability.

If we like a certain food but know that it makes us sick, common sense moves us to avoid eating it. We also prove that we are sound in mind when we get sufficient sleep, exercise regularly, maintain a good routine of personal hygiene, and keep our home clean. <a class="xt" data-xtid="409" href="jwpub://p/E:2023286/13-14"><em>w23.02</em> 21 ¶6-7</a></p>

Consider what <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="115-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a> states. Note that “all Scripture is . . . beneficial” for (1) teaching, (2) reproving, (3) setting things straight, and (4) disciplining. You can obtain those four benefits even from Bible books that you do not use often. Analyze the account to see what it teaches you about Jehovah, about his purpose, or about godly principles. Consider how it is helpful for reproving. Do this by noting how the verses help you to identify and reject wrong tendencies or attitudes and to remain on a faithful course. Examine how the passage can be used to set straight, or correct, a wrong viewpoint, perhaps one you have encountered in the ministry. And look for any discipline the verses provide that can train you to reflect Jehovah’s thinking. When you keep these four benefits in mind, you will find spiritual treasures that can enrich your Bible reading. <a class="xt" data-xtid="410" href="jwpub://p/E:2023281/18-18"><em>w23.02</em> 11 ¶11</a></p>

<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="sb">A prophecy in the book of Daniel foretold that Jesus would receive his Kingdom at the end of a prophetic period of seven times. Is it possible to know when that joyous event occurred? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:10-27:4:17" data-bid="117-1" class="b">Dan. 4:10-17</a>) The “seven times” represent a period of 2,520 years. That time period began in 607 B.C.E. when the Babylonians removed the last king from Jehovah’s throne in Jerusalem. It ended in 1914 C.E. when Jehovah enthroned Jesus​—“the one who has the legal right”—​as King of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:25-26:21:27" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:25-27</a>) How can this prophecy benefit us? Knowing about the “seven times” reassures us that Jehovah fulfills his promises right on time. Just as he set a definite time for the establishment of his Kingdom, he will also see to it that all the other prophecies will be fulfilled according to his timetable.
