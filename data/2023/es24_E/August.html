We need to endure for the right reasons. Our God is interested in not only what we do but also why we do it.

The apostle Paul used the Scriptures to build up the faith of his brothers and sisters.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">The Greek expression translated “making your mind over” can be rendered “renovation of your mind.” Therefore, we cannot simply decorate our life with a few good works. Rather, we must examine the person we are deep inside and make any needed changes so that we can bring our life as close as possible to Jehovah’s standards. We should do this, not once, but continually. When we reach perfection, we will always be able to please Jehovah in everything we do. In the meantime, we need to keep working hard toward that goal. Notice the connection Paul made between making our mind over and discerning God’s will, as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Romans 12:2</a>. Instead of passively allowing ourselves to be molded by this system of things, we must first examine ourselves to determine how much we are letting God’s thinking​—not the world’s—​influence our goals and decisions. <a class="xt" data-xtid="271" href="jwpub://p/E:2023241/9-10"><em>w23.01</em> 8-9 ¶3-4</a></p>

No, the Bible does not support that view.

How? One way that Jehovah helps us is by providing comfort and encouragement, often just at the right time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="102-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3, 4</a>) Can you think of a time in your life when Jehovah sustained you by providing comfort and encouragement just when you needed it most?

How well this description fits the United Nations organization, which promotes the interests of the worldwide political system! It existed first as the League of Nations. Then it went out of existence during World War II. It later emerged again in its present-day form. By means of their propaganda, the political beasts stir up opposition to Jehovah and his people. Symbolically, they gather “the kings of the entire inhabited earth” together to the war of Armageddon, which is “the great day of God the Almighty.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:13-66:16:14" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> 16</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="273" href="jwpub://p/E:2022401/17-18"><em>w22.05</em> 10 ¶10-11</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">When Jesus learned to read the Sacred Writings on his own, he not only came to know the Scriptures well but also loved them and allowed them to influence his actions. For example, recall the incident in the temple when Jesus was just 12 years old. The teachers who were well-versed in the Mosaic Law were in “amazement at [Jesus’] understanding and his answers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:46-42:2:47" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Luke 2:46, 47,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:52-42:2:52" data-bid="107-2" class="b"> 52</a>) We too can come to know and love God’s Word as we regularly read the Scriptures. We can learn from what Jesus said to those familiar with the Law, including the scribes, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees. Those religious leaders read the Scriptures often, but they failed to benefit from what they read. Jesus highlighted three ways in which these men were not getting the most out of the Scriptures. His words to them will help us improve in our ability (1) to understand what we read, (2) to find spiritual treasures, and (3) to allow God’s Word to mold us. <a class="xt" data-xtid="274" href="jwpub://p/E:2023281/7-8"><em>w23.02</em> 8-9 ¶2-3</a></p>
