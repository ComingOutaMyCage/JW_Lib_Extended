(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5</a>) King Solomon wrote: “Wisdom is the most important thing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:7-20:4:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 4:7</a>) Of course, Solomon was not talking about just any sort of wisdom. He was referring to the wisdom that comes from Jehovah God. But can godly wisdom help us deal with the kinds of problems we face today? Yes, it can. One way that we can become truly wise is by studying and applying the teachings of two men who are widely respected for their wisdom. First, consider Solomon. The Bible says that “God gave Solomon wisdom and discernment in very great measure.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:29-11:4:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:29</a>) Second, consider Jesus, whose wisdom was unparalleled.

In some cases, an individual has sinned against us​—even seriously—​but then he may apologize and ask for our forgiveness. In other cases, the person may not. Even so, we can choose to forgive the person in the sense that we can decide to let go of any resentment and anger that we feel toward him. Realistically, this may take time and effort, especially if we have been deeply hurt. <em>The Watchtower</em> of September 15, 1994, says: “When you do forgive a sinner, this does not mean that you are condoning the sin. For the Christian, forgiveness means trustfully leaving the matter in Jehovah’s hands. He is the righteous Judge of all the universe, and he will carry out justice at the right time.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="144" href="jwpub://p/E:2022441/12-13"><em>w22.06</em> 9 ¶6-7</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:19-41:7:19" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Mark 7:19</a>) From that time on, some Jewish Christians felt free to eat all kinds of foods. Other Jewish Christians, however, could not bring themselves to do so. The congregation became divided over this issue. The apostle Paul underscored the importance of keeping peace. Paul thus helped his fellow believers to see how damaging such disputes were to individuals and to the congregation as a whole. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:19-45:14:20" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Rom. 14:19, 20</a>) He was also willing to change his own behavior to avoid stumbling others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:19-46:9:22" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:19-22</a>) We can likewise build others up and maintain peace if we refrain from making issues over matters of personal preference. <a class="xt" data-xtid="151" href="jwpub://p/E:2022525/14-14"><em>w22.08</em> 22 ¶7</a></p>

Regarding the Hebrew Scriptures, for example, one scholar wrote: “It may be safely said that no other work of antiquity has been so accurately transmitted.” So we can be confident that the words we read in our Bible today convey the thoughts of its Author, Jehovah. Jehovah is the Source of “every good gift and every perfect present.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>) The Bible is one of the best gifts that Jehovah has given us.

First, though, we do well to ask ourselves such questions as: ‘Do I have enough facts?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Prov. 18:13</a>) ‘Could it be that the offense was not intentional?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:20-21:7:20" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:20</a>) ‘Have I ever made a similar mistake?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:21-21:7:22" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:21, 22</a>) ‘By approaching the person, will I create a bigger issue than the one I am trying to resolve?’ When we take time to consider such questions, we may conclude that our love for our brother can move us simply to overlook the offense. We individually prove that we are real followers of Jesus when we show unselfish love toward our brothers and sisters despite their imperfections. In the process, we may help others to recognize the true religion and to join us in worshipping Jehovah. Let us be determined to continue demonstrating the love that identifies true Christians. <a class="xt" data-xtid="165" href="jwpub://p/E:2023326/26-27"><em>w23.03</em> 31 ¶18-19</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">The Bible gives evidence of its Author’s greatest quality​—love. Because Jehovah loves us, he did not overwhelm us with more details than we can handle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:25-43:21:25" data-bid="98-1" class="b">John 21:25</a>) Jehovah also showed love by communicating with us in a style that dignifies us. In the Bible, he does not give us an endless list of rules, micromanaging every aspect of our life. Rather, he appeals to our thinking ability through real-life stories, stirring prophecies, and practical counsel. In these ways, God’s Word moves us to love and obey him from our heart. The Bible reveals that Jehovah is keenly interested in us. How so? His Word is filled with accounts that express human emotion. We can relate to Bible characters because they were people “with feelings like ours.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:17-59:5:17" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Jas. 5:17</a>) More important, by observing how he dealt with people like us, we are able to understand more clearly that “Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Jas. 5:11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="166" href="jwpub://p/E:2023280/21-23"><em>w23.02</em> 6 ¶13-15</a></p>

And we may be eager to discuss such events with one another. When discussing Bible prophecy, however, we should avoid speculating. Why? Because we would not want to say anything that could cause disunity in the congregation. For instance, we may hear world leaders talk about how they can solve a particular conflict and bring peace and security. Instead of speculating that such a statement fulfills the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:3-52:5:3" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, we need to keep up-to-date with the latest published information. When we base our discussions on material published by Jehovah’s organization, we help the congregation to remain united “in the same line of thought.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:6-46:4:6" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> 4:6</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="167" href="jwpub://p/E:2023285/10-11"><em>w23.02</em> 16 ¶4-5</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="106-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) How, though, does Jesus promote humility? Jesus promotes humility by his example.

Does it not move you to love God’s Son and to follow him? Surely it does. Why is Jesus humble? Because he loves and imitates his Father, who is humble.

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">The Bible speaks of two groups of people who will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever on earth, “the righteous” and “the unrighteous.” “The righteous” are those who faithfully served Jehovah while they were alive. On the other hand, “the unrighteous” did not. Because both groups are resurrected, can we say that their names are written in the book of life? Before dying, “the righteous” had their names written in the book of life. Were their names taken out of that book when they died? No, because they are still “living” in Jehovah’s memory. Jehovah “is a God, not of the dead, but of the living, for they are all living to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:38-42:20:38" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Luke 20:38</a>) This means that when the righteous are restored to life on earth, their names will be found written in the book of life, although “in pencil” at first.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:14-42:14:14" data-bid="111-1" class="b">Luke 14:14</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="169" href="jwpub://p/E:2022567/16-17"><em>w22.09</em> 16 ¶9-10</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:19-1:2:20" data-bid="114-1" class="b">Gen. 2:19, 20</a>) Jehovah could have chosen each name himself; instead, he delegated the task to Adam. No doubt before deciding what to call them, Adam studied the animals carefully, observing their specific traits and behaviors. Adam must have enjoyed this experience. It surely gave him an opportunity to increase his appreciation for his Father’s wisdom, artistry, and creativity. <a class="xt" data-xtid="170" href="jwpub://p/E:2023324/9-9"><em>w23.03</em> 15 ¶3</a></p>

Furthermore, he revealed that the Anglo-American World Power would be the last of these.
