<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ask yourself: ‘How do I respond to counsel? Do I quickly acknowledge my mistakes, or do I try to justify myself? Am I quick to blame others?’ As you read about faithful men and women in the Bible, consider how they dealt with such matters. In each case, ask yourself: ‘How can I be more like this loyal servant of Jehovah?’ We can also benefit by observing fellow believers, both young and old. For instance, can you think of someone in your congregation who is faithfully enduring a trial​—perhaps peer pressure, family opposition, or poor health? Do you see in this person commendable traits that you would like to cultivate to a greater degree? By considering his or her good example, you may learn practical ways to endure your own trials. How grateful we are to have such living examples of faith to imitate​—truly a cause for rejoicing!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="106" href="jwpub://p/E:2022368/21-22"><em>w22.04</em> 13 ¶13-14</a></p>

Beware of setting a goal that is too general.

More than once, Jesus corrected Peter in front of the other apostles.

However, Peter remained loyal to Jesus. He accepted the discipline and learned from his mistakes. Consequently, Jehovah rewarded Peter’s loyalty and assigned him weighty responsibilities in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:17" data-bid="51-1" class="b">John 21:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:24-44:10:33" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> Acts 10:24-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:1-60:1:1" data-bid="51-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:1</a>) We benefit ourselves and others when we see beyond the embarrassment of the discipline, accept the correction, and make the needed adjustments.

Instead, strengthen your friendship with Jehovah and help your children to do the same. If at times you feel anxious, pour out your heart to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:7-19:62:8" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Ps. 62:7, 8</a>) As a family, discuss all the reasons why you can trust in him. As in the case of a disaster, your personal preparation and your trust in Jehovah will instill in your children courage and peace. The peace of God makes us feel secure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) By means of it, Jehovah calms our heart despite the diseases, disasters, and persecution that can affect us today. He uses hardworking elders to shepherd us. And he gives all of us the privilege of helping one another. The peace that we enjoy now will equip us to face greater trials to come, even the “great tribulation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="133" href="jwpub://p/E:2022687/25-26"><em>w22.12</em> 27 ¶17-18</a></p>

Life there will never be boring. We will always have interesting people to meet and meaningful work to do. Best of all, each day we will be able to come to know our heavenly Father better and enjoy what he has provided. We will never run out of things to learn about him, and there will be so much to learn about his creation. <a class="xt" data-xtid="134" href="jwpub://p/E:2022681/26-26"><em>w22.12</em> 13 ¶17,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="135" href="jwpub://p/E:2022681/29-29"> 19</a></p>

The wise principles found in the Bible are everlasting; they have proved to be beneficial to people living in every time period. As we read that sacred book and meditate on what we learn, the Author uses his powerful holy spirit to help us see how we can apply the Bible’s counsel in our life.
