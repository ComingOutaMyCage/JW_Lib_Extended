Why do you boast?​—1 Cor. 4:7.



The apostle Peter urged his brothers to use whatever gifts and talents they had to build up their fellow believers. Peter wrote: “To the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness.” (1 Pet. 4:10) We should not hold back from using our gifts to the fullest for fear that others may become jealous or get discouraged. But we must be careful that we do not boast about them. (1 Cor. 4:6) Let us remember that any natural abilities we may have are gifts from God. We should use those gifts to build up the congregation, not to promote ourselves. (Phil. 2:3) When we use our energy and abilities to do God’s will, we will have cause for rejoicing​—not because we are outdoing others or proving ourselves superior to them, but because we are using our gifts to bring praise to Jehovah. w22.04 11-12 ¶7-9

Open my eyes so that I may see clearly the wonderful things from your law.​—Ps. 119:18.



Jesus loved the Holy Scriptures, and his feelings were prophetically expressed in the words found at Psalm 40:8: “To do your will, O my God, is my delight, and your law is deep within me.” As a result, he was happy and successful in serving Jehovah. We too can enjoy happiness and success if we work on getting God’s Word into our heart. (Ps. 1:1-3) In harmony with Jesus’ words and example, let us sharpen our Bible-reading skills. We can improve our understanding of Bible passages by praying, reading at a slow pace, asking questions, and taking brief notes. We can use discernment by carefully analyzing what we read with the help of our Bible-based publications. And we can let God’s Word mold us by maintaining the right attitude as we read. When we apply ourselves in these ways, we will get more out of our Bible reading and draw ever closer to Jehovah.​—Ps. 119:17; Jas. 4:8. w23.02 13 ¶15-16




Sunday, March 3

The plans of the diligent surely lead to success.​—Prov. 21:5.



Choose a specific goal and then take practical steps to reach your goal. How can this be accomplished? Suppose you wanted to improve your ability to teach. You could carefully study the brochure Apply Yourself to Reading and Teaching. When you are assigned a part on the midweek meeting, you could ask a qualified brother to listen to your presentation beforehand and provide suggestions for improvement. Earn a reputation not just for being skilled but also for being diligent and dependable. (2 Cor. 8:22) What if the skill you want to develop involves something that you are not naturally good at? Do not give up! Did Timothy become a notable speaker or an outstanding teacher? The Bible does not say. But no doubt Timothy became progressively more effective in carrying out his responsibilities as he followed Paul’s advice.​—2 Tim. 3:10. w22.04 24-25 ¶8-11




Monday, March 4

I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads.​—Rev. 13:1.



What is the seven-headed wild beast? We notice that this beast has the general appearance of a leopard but the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion, and it has ten horns. All of these are also features of the four beasts mentioned in Daniel chapter 7. Yet, here in the book of Revelation, these characteristics are combined into one beast, not four separate beasts. This wild beast does not represent just one government or world empire. It is spoken of as ruling “over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.” So it must be greater than any single national government. (Rev. 13:7) This wild beast, then, must represent all the political powers that have dominated humankind down through history. (Eccl. 8:9) Another indication is that the number ten is often used in the Bible to denote completeness. w22.05 9 ¶6




Tuesday, March 5

He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.​—Rev. 21:4.



Who will benefit from these wonderful provisions? First of all, the great crowd of Armageddon survivors, along with any children who may be born in the new world. But Revelation chapter 20 also promises that the dead will be resurrected. (Rev. 20:11-13) Faithful “righteous” ones who died in the past along with “unrighteous” ones​—who did not receive an adequate opportunity to learn about Jehovah—​will all come back to life here on the earth. (Acts 24:15; John 5:28, 29) Does this mean that everyone will be resurrected during the Thousand Year Reign? No. Those who wickedly rejected the opportunity to serve Jehovah before their death will not be raised to life. They had their chance and proved that they were not worthy of life on the Paradise earth.​—Matt. 25:46; 2 Thess. 1:9; Rev. 17:8; 20:15. w22.05 18 ¶16-17




Wednesday, March 6

Whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life.​—John 6:68.



By means of “the faithful and discreet slave,” Jesus has built up a remarkable organization on earth to promote pure worship. (Matt. 24:45) How do you feel about that organization? In response, perhaps you think of the words of the apostle Peter, who said the words of today’s text to Jesus. Where would any of us be today if we had not come in contact with Jehovah’s organization? Through it, Christ makes sure that we are well-fed spiritually. He also trains us to carry out our ministry effectively. Further, he helps us to put on “the new personality,” so that we are pleasing to Jehovah. (Eph. 4:24) Jesus provides wise direction in times of crisis. The benefits of that direction were evident when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. While many in the world were uncertain about what course to take, Jesus made sure that we received clear guidance to keep us safe. w22.07 12 ¶13-14




Thursday, March 7

Make sure of the more important things.​—Phil. 1:10.



Jehovah instructed the ancient Israelites to teach their children about him regularly. (Deut. 6:6, 7) Those parents had many opportunities throughout the day to talk with their children and instill love for Jehovah in their heart. For instance, a young Israelite boy might spend hours helping his father plant the crops or bring in the harvest. His sister might spend much of the day helping her mother with sewing, weaving, and other household chores. As parents and children worked together, they could talk about many important topics. For example, they could discuss Jehovah’s quality of goodness and consider how he was helping the family. In many lands, parents and children cannot spend time together throughout the day. The parents may be at work, and the children may be in school. As a result, parents must look for occasions when they can talk with their children.​—Eph. 5:15, 16. w22.05 28 ¶10-11




Friday, March 8

Do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God’s Kingdom?​—1 Cor. 6:9.



Serious sins are gross violations of God’s law. If a Christian commits such a sin, he must approach Jehovah God in prayer, and he must go to the elders of the congregation. (Ps. 32:5; Jas. 5:14) What role do the elders play? Only Jehovah has the authority to forgive sins fully, which he makes possible on the basis of the ransom sacrifice. Jehovah, however, has entrusted the elders with the responsibility of determining from the Scriptures whether the sinner can remain in the congregation. (1 Cor. 5:12) Among other things, they will endeavor to answer the following questions: Was the sin intentional? Did the person scheme to do what was wrong? Did he practice the sin over an extended period of time? Most important, is there evidence that he is sincerely repentant? Are there indications that Jehovah has forgiven him?​—Acts 3:19. w22.06 9 ¶4




Saturday, March 9

Love truth.​—Zech. 8:19.



Jesus urged his followers to pursue righteousness. (Matt. 5:6) This means that one needs to have a strong desire to do what is right, good, and clean in God’s eyes. Do you love truth and righteousness? We are sure that you do. You hate lies and all that is wrong and wicked. (Ps. 119:128, 163) Lies reflect the personality of Satan, the ruler of this world. (John 8:44; 12:31) One of Satan’s goals is to slander the holy name of Jehovah God. Satan has been spreading lies about our God since the rebellion in Eden. He portrayed Jehovah as a selfish and dishonest Ruler who withholds good from humans. (Gen. 3:1, 4, 5) Satan’s lies about Jehovah have continued to poison the minds and hearts of people. When humans choose not to “love truth,” Satan can lead them into all kinds of unrighteous and wicked conduct.​—Rom. 1:25-31. w23.03 2 ¶3




Sunday, March 10

[Jehovah’s] love endures forever.​—Ps. 100:5.



As you work to overcome a bad habit, you may suffer an occasional relapse. Or you may just feel impatient and frustrated because your goal seems far away. What will help you to endure? A vital quality​—love for Jehovah. Your love for Jehovah is a beautiful quality, the very best you have. (Prov. 3:3-6) Strong love for God can help you to face life’s challenges successfully. The Bible often refers to Jehovah’s loyal love for his servants. This is a strong attachment that never quits, never lets go. You are made in God’s image. (Gen. 1:26) How can you reflect that kind of love? Start with gratitude. (1 Thess. 5:18) Each day, ask yourself, ‘How has Jehovah shown love to me?’ Then make sure to thank Jehovah in your prayers, mentioning specific things that he has done for you. See his acts of love as personal, directed to you as an individual. w23.03 12 ¶17-19




Monday, March 11

[Jesus] knew what was in man.​—John 2:25.



Jesus dealt with all 12 apostles in a kind and loving way. The lesson for us? What matters is not only what other people do but also how we react to their mistakes and shortcomings. When we are upset with a fellow believer, we can ask ourselves: ‘Why does what he did bother me so much? Does it reveal a negative trait that I need to work on? Could it be that the person who upset me is dealing with a difficulty? Even if I feel that I am justified for being upset, can I show unselfish love by overlooking the offense?’ The more we deal with others in a loving way, the more we prove to be Jesus’ true followers. Jesus’ example also teaches us to try to understand our fellow believers. (Prov. 20:5) Granted, Jesus could read hearts. We cannot. But we can make allowances for the imperfections of our brothers and sisters. (Eph. 4:1, 2; 1 Pet. 3:8) It is easier to do so if we learn about their background. w23.03 30 ¶14-16




Tuesday, March 12

He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living.​—Luke 20:38.



Satan may take advantage of a life-threatening medical situation to try to get us to compromise. Medical doctors or unbelieving family members may pressure us to accept a blood transfusion, which would violate God’s law. Or someone may try to persuade us to consider another therapy that goes against Scriptural principles. Although we do not want to die, we know that Jehovah will not stop loving us if our life should end. (Rom. 8:37-39) When Jehovah’s friends die, he keeps them in his memory, as if they were still alive. (Luke 20:37) He longs to bring them back to life. (Job 14:15) Jehovah has paid a high price so that we “might . . . have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) We know how deeply Jehovah loves us and cares for us. So rather than abandon Jehovah when we are sick or threatened with death, we turn to him for comfort, wisdom, and strength.​—Ps. 41:3. w22.06 18 ¶16-17




Wednesday, March 13

True wisdom cries aloud in the street.​—Prov. 1:20.



The Bible states: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.” (Prov. 9:10) So when we have an important decision to make, we should make Jehovah’s thinking​—“knowledge of the Most Holy One”—​the basis for our decision. We can do that by consulting the Bible and Bible-based publications. When we do, we are showing true wisdom. (Prov. 2:5-7) Jehovah is the only one who can give us true wisdom. (Rom. 16:27) Why is he the Source of wisdom? First, as the Creator, he has unlimited knowledge and understanding of his creation. (Ps. 104:24) Second, all of Jehovah’s actions reflect wisdom. (Rom. 11:33) Third, Jehovah’s wise counsel always benefits those who apply it. (Prov. 2:10-12) If we are to acquire true wisdom, we must accept these basic truths and allow them to guide us when making decisions and when taking a course of action. w22.10 19 ¶3-4




Thursday, March 14

War broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven.​—Rev. 12:7, 8.



Satan lost the battle foretold in Revelation chapter 12, and he and the demons were hurled down to the earth. Enraged, Satan began to vent his anger on humankind, resulting in “woe for the earth.” (Rev. 12:9-12) How can these prophecies benefit us? World events and the noticeable change in people’s attitude would help us discern that Jesus has become King. So rather than become upset when we see people act selfishly and hatefully, we remember that their actions are fulfilling Bible prophecy. The Kingdom is in place! (Ps. 37:1) And we can expect world distress to increase as Armageddon draws ever nearer. (Mark 13:8; 2 Tim. 3:13) Are you not thankful to our loving heavenly Father for helping us to make sense of our turbulent times? w22.07 3-4 ¶7-8




Friday, March 15

A righteous man’s supplication has a powerful effect.​—Jas. 5:16.



We can ask Jehovah to help our fellow worshippers to endure sickness, natural disasters, civil war, persecution, or other difficulties. We can also pray for our self-sacrificing brothers and sisters who provide relief for those in need. You may personally know some who are facing such challenges. Why not mention them by name in your personal prayers? We show genuine brotherly love by asking Jehovah to help them to endure. Those who take the lead in the congregation greatly appreciate the prayers of others and benefit from them. That was true of the apostle Paul. He wrote: “Pray also for me, that the words may be given to me when I open my mouth, so that I may be able to speak boldly in making known the sacred secret of the good news.” (Eph. 6:19) Today, too, we have many hardworking brothers who take the lead among us. We show love for them by asking Jehovah to bless their work. w22.07 23-24 ¶14-16




Saturday, March 16

Put on . . . the hope of salvation as a helmet.​—1 Thess. 5:8.



A soldier wears a helmet to protect his head. In our spiritual warfare, we need to protect our mind from Satan’s attacks. He bombards us with temptations and ideas designed to corrupt our thinking. Just as the helmet protects a soldier’s head, our hope protects our thinking so that we can remain faithful to Jehovah. If our hope weakens and we allow fleshly thinking to take hold of our mind, we can lose sight of the goal of everlasting life. Consider the case of some Christians living in ancient Corinth. They lost faith in a key promise of God​—the hope of the resurrection. (1 Cor. 15:12) Paul argued that people with no hope of a future life live only for the present. (1 Cor. 15:32) Today many who have no hope in God’s promises live for the moment, grasping whatever pleasures are available to them. We, however, put our trust in the future promised by God. w22.10 25-26 ¶8-9




Sunday, March 17

Pray constantly.​—1 Thess. 5:17.



Jehovah invites you to pray to him. He sees what you are dealing with, and he assures you that he will listen to your prayers at any time. He finds pleasure in listening to his worshippers. (Prov. 15:8) What can you pray about when you feel alone? Pour your heart out to Jehovah. (Ps. 62:8) Tell him about your concerns and how they make you feel. Ask Jehovah to help you to cope with your feelings and to give you the courage you need to express yourself. You can even ask him for the wisdom to explain your beliefs tactfully. (Luke 21:14, 15) If you are struggling with negative emotions, ask Jehovah to help you to talk with a mature Christian about it. You can ask Jehovah to help the one you are confiding in to listen to you with understanding. See how he responds to your prayers, and accept the help of others; you will feel less alone. w22.08 10 ¶6




Monday, March 18

These men act in opposition to the decrees of Caesar.​—Acts 17:7.



The new congregation in Thessalonica faced severe opposition. A mob of vicious opposers dragged “some of the brothers to the city rulers.” (Acts 17:6) Can you imagine how shaken those newly converted Christians must have been? They could have slowed down in their service to Jehovah, but the apostle Paul did not want that to happen. He made sure that the fledgling congregation was well cared for. Paul reminded the Thessalonians: “We sent Timothy, our brother . . . , to make you firm and comfort you regarding your faith, so that no one might be shaken by these tribulations.” (1 Thess. 3:2, 3) Timothy had seen how Paul strengthened the brothers in Lystra. Having seen the outcome that Jehovah gave, Timothy could assure his new brothers and sisters that everything would turn out well for them too.​—Acts 14:8, 19-22; Heb. 12:2. w22.08 21 ¶4




Tuesday, March 19

We . . . gain life through him.​—1 John 4:9.



In the late 19th century, a group of Bible students led by Charles Taze Russell began an intensive study of the Scriptures. They wanted to know the truth about the value of Jesus’ sacrifice and how his death should be commemorated. Today we benefit from their research. How so? Our eyes have been opened to the truth about Jesus’ sacrifice and what it accomplishes. (1 John 2:1, 2) We have also learned that the Bible holds out two hopes for humans who please God​—immortal life in heaven for some and everlasting life on earth for others. We draw closer to Jehovah as we consider how much he loves us and how much we personally benefit from Jesus’ sacrifice. (1 Pet. 3:18) So like our faithful brothers of the past, we invite others to join us in observing the Memorial according to the pattern Jesus set. w23.01 21 ¶6-7

He died for all so that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up.​—2 Cor. 5:15.



Jesus taught people about the blessings that God’s Kingdom would bring. We are thankful for the ransom because it opens the way for us to enjoy a close friendship with Jehovah and Jesus. Those who exercise faith in Jesus also have the hope of living forever and of seeing their dead loved ones again. (John 5:28, 29; Rom. 6:23) We have not done anything to deserve these blessings; nor can we ever repay God and Christ for what they have done for us. (Rom. 5:8, 20, 21) But we can show them the depth of our gratitude. How? By using our resources to advance the Kingdom work. For example, we can make ourselves available to help with constructing and maintaining buildings for pure worship. w23.01 26 ¶3; 28 ¶5

I saw . . . the Lamb . . . and with him 144,000.​—Rev. 14:1.



Those ruling in God’s Kingdom will help to care for billions of people living across the globe. Like Jesus, the 144,000 will serve as kings and priests. (Rev. 5:10) Under the Mosaic Law, the priests were primarily responsible for protecting the people’s physical health while making sure that they were spiritually healthy. The Law was “a shadow of the good things to come,” so it is reasonable to conclude that Jesus’ corulers will assist in the unique role of caring for the physical and spiritual needs of God’s people. (Heb. 10:1) We will have to wait and see just how these kings and priests will communicate with subjects of the Kingdom who are on earth. We can be confident that in the Paradise to come, those on earth will receive the guidance they need.​—Rev. 21:3, 4. w22.12 11 ¶11-13

Friday, March 22

You keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he comes.​—1 Cor. 11:26.



One reason why we invite others to observe the Memorial with us is that we want those who attend for the first time to learn the truth about what Jehovah and Jesus have done for all of us. (John 3:16) We hope that what they see and hear at the Memorial will move them to learn more and to become servants of Jehovah. We also invite those who are no longer serving Jehovah. We do so to remind them that God still loves them. Many respond to our invitation, and we are overjoyed to see them. Attending the Memorial reminds them of how much they enjoyed serving Jehovah in the past. (Ps. 103:1-4) Whether people respond positively to our invitation or not, we diligently invite others to the Memorial, knowing that Jehovah is interested in individuals.​—Luke 15:7; 1 Tim. 2:3, 4. w23.01 20 ¶1; 22-23 ¶9-11

The eye of Jehovah watches over those fearing him.​—Ps. 33:18.



On the night before he died, Jesus made a special request to his heavenly Father. He asked Jehovah to watch over his followers. (John 17:15, 20) Jehovah has always watched over​—cared for and protected—​his people. However, Jesus knew that his followers would face unprecedented opposition from Satan. Jesus also realized that they would need Jehovah’s help to resist the Devil’s wicked attacks. Satan’s system puts an immense amount of pressure on true Christians today. We face adversities that can discourage us and even test our loyalty to Jehovah. But we have nothing to fear. Jehovah is watching over us​—he sees the challenges we are facing, and he is ever ready to help us deal with them. Yes, Jehovah “watches over those fearing him . . . to rescue them.”​—Ps. 33:18-20. w22.08 8 ¶1-2

Keep doing this in remembrance of me.​—Luke 22:19.



Each year during the Memorial season, we show our appreciation for what Jesus has done by taking time to meditate prayerfully on the meaning of his death. We also encourage as many as possible to join us for this special occasion. And we are determined not to allow anything to prevent us from attending the Memorial. At the Memorial, we learn why mankind needs a ransom and how the death of one man can atone for the sins of many. We are reminded of what the bread and the wine represent and who should partake of them. (Luke 22:19, 20) And we meditate on the blessings that are in store for those who cherish the earthly hope. (Isa. 35:5, 6; 65:17, 21-23) We should not take these truths for granted. w23.01 20 ¶2; 21 ¶4

God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might . . . have everlasting life.​—John 3:16.



By giving his Son as a ransom to cover our sins, God makes it possible for us to gain everlasting life. (Matt. 20:28) The apostle Paul wrote: “Since death came through a man, resurrection of the dead also comes through a man. For just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive.” (1 Cor. 15:21, 22) Jesus taught his followers to pray for God’s Kingdom to come and for God’s will to take place on earth. (Matt. 6:9, 10) Part of God’s purpose is for humans to live forever on the earth. To accomplish that, Jehovah has appointed his Son as King of the Messianic Kingdom. God has been gathering 144,000 people from the earth to work with Jesus in fulfilling God’s will.​—Rev. 5:9, 10. w22.12 5 ¶11-12

The love the Christ has compels us . . . so that those who live should live no longer for themselves.​—2 Cor. 5:14, 15.



When we lose a loved one in death, we miss that person so much! At first, we may feel nothing but pain, especially if our loved one suffered before dying. With time, however, we begin to feel a measure of joy when we think of something he taught us or something he did or said to encourage us or to make us smile. In a similar way, it saddens us to read about Jesus’ suffering and death. During the Memorial season, we especially take time to reflect on the significance of his ransom sacrifice. (1 Cor. 11:24, 25) However, we find great joy in reflecting on all the things Jesus said and did while he was on earth. We also find it stimulating to think about what he is doing now and what he will do for us in the future. w23.01 26 ¶1-2

[Seek] first the Kingdom.​—Matt. 6:33.



The disciples were very sad when Jesus died. Not only had they lost their beloved friend but they also felt as though they had lost their hope. (Luke 24:17-21) However, when Jesus appeared to them, he took the time to help them understand his role in fulfilling Bible prophecy. He also gave them an important work to do. (Luke 24:26, 27, 45-48) By the time Jesus ascended to heaven, the sadness of the disciples had turned into great joy. Knowing that their Master was alive and ready to help them accomplish their new commission made them happy. Their joy moved them to praise Jehovah without letup. (Luke 24:52, 53; Acts 5:42) To imitate Jesus’ disciples requires that we put God’s Kingdom first in our life. Although we need endurance to serve Jehovah continually, he promises to bless us richly if we do so.​—Prov. 10:22. w23.01 30-31 ¶15-16

To dust you will return.​—Gen. 3:19.



We certainly do not want to make the same mistake that Adam and Eve made. We can avoid that outcome if we keep learning about Jehovah, appreciating his qualities, and trying to understand his way of thinking. As we do, our love for Jehovah is sure to grow. Consider Abraham. He truly loved Jehovah. Even when he found it hard to grasp Jehovah’s decisions, Abraham did not rebel. Instead, he tried to get to know Jehovah better. For example, when he learned of Jehovah’s decision to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham was at first afraid that “the Judge of all the earth” would sweep away the righteous along with the wicked. To Abraham, that seemed unthinkable, so he humbly asked Jehovah a series of questions. Jehovah patiently answered him. Finally, Abraham came to realize that Jehovah examines the heart of every human and that He never punishes the innocent along with the guilty.​—Gen. 18:20-32. w22.08 28 ¶9-10




Friday, March 29

The trustworthy person keeps a confidence.​—Prov. 11:13.



In 455 B.C.E., after Governor Nehemiah rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, he looked for dependable men who would take good care of the city. Nehemiah selected, among others, the chief of the Fortress, Hananiah. The Bible describes Hananiah as “a most trustworthy man [who] feared the true God more than many others.” (Neh. 7:2) Love for Jehovah and fear of displeasing him moved Hananiah to take seriously any assignment he was given. Those qualities will also help us to be dependable in our service to God. Note the example of Tychicus, a trusted companion of the apostle Paul. Paul relied on Tychicus, describing him as a “faithful minister.” (Eph. 6:21, 22) Paul trusted him not only to deliver letters to the brothers in Ephesus and Colossae but also to encourage and comfort them. Tychicus reminds us of the faithful, reliable men who care for our spiritual needs today.​—Col. 4:7-9. w22.09 9-10 ¶5-6




Saturday, March 30

Love covers a multitude of sins.​—1 Pet. 4:8.



Joseph faced severe trials that lasted about 13 years. Joseph could have questioned whether Jehovah really loved him. And he could have wondered if Jehovah had abandoned him in his time of need. But Joseph did not become embittered. Instead, he kept his senses by remaining calm. When he had the chance to retaliate against his brothers, he refrained from doing so and showed love for them and forgave them. (Gen. 45:4, 5) Joseph behaved this way because he was able to think clearly. Rather than focus on his problems, he saw the big picture​—Jehovah’s purpose. (Gen. 50:19-21) What is the lesson? If you are mistreated, do not become embittered against Jehovah or wonder if he has abandoned you. Instead, meditate on how he is helping you to endure the trial. Additionally, when others mistreat you, try to cover over their imperfections with love. w22.11 21 ¶4




Sunday, March 31

All rulerships will serve and obey them.​—Dan. 7:27.



The prophet Daniel saw visions that clearly showed Jehovah’s supremacy over all other authorities. Daniel first saw four huge beasts that symbolize past and present world powers​—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome and its modern-day offshoot, Anglo-America. (Dan. 7:1-3, 17) Then Daniel saw Jehovah God sitting enthroned in the heavenly court. (Dan. 7:9, 10) God takes all rulership away from human governments and gives it to others more deserving and more powerful. To whom? To “someone like a son of man,” Jesus Christ, and to “the holy ones of the Supreme One,” the 144,000 who will rule “forever and ever.” (Dan. 7:13, 14, 18) Clearly, Jehovah is “the Supreme One.” The event that Daniel saw in vision harmonizes with something he had stated earlier. “The God of heaven,” Daniel said, “removes kings and sets up kings.”​—Dan. 2:19-21. w22.10 14-15 ¶9-11
