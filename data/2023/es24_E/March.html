<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">The Bible states: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:10-20:9:10" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Prov. 9:10</a>) So when we have an important decision to make, we should make Jehovah’s thinking​—“knowledge of the Most Holy One”—​the basis for our decision. We can do that by consulting the Bible and Bible-based publications. When we do, we are showing true wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:5-20:2:7" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Prov. 2:5-7</a>) Jehovah is the only one who can give us true wisdom.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24</a>) Second, all of Jehovah’s actions reflect wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:33-45:11:33" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Rom. 11:33</a>) Third, Jehovah’s wise counsel always benefits those who apply it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:10-20:2:12" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Prov. 2:10-12</a>) If we are to acquire true wisdom, we must accept these basic truths and allow them to guide us when making decisions and when taking a course of action. <a class="xt" data-xtid="85" href="jwpub://p/E:2022605/9-10"><em>w22.10</em> 19 ¶3-4</a></p>

With time, however, we begin to feel a measure of joy when we think of something he taught us or something he did or said to encourage us or to make us smile. In a similar way, it saddens us to read about Jesus’ suffering and death. During the Memorial season, we especially take time to reflect on the significance of his ransom sacrifice.

We can avoid that outcome if we keep learning about Jehovah, appreciating his qualities, and trying to understand his way of thinking. As we do, our love for Jehovah is sure to grow. Consider Abraham. He truly loved Jehovah. Even when he found it hard to grasp Jehovah’s decisions, Abraham did not rebel. Instead, he tried to get to know Jehovah better. For example, when he learned of Jehovah’s decision to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham was at first afraid that “the Judge of all the earth” would sweep away the righteous along with the wicked. To Abraham, that seemed unthinkable, so he humbly asked Jehovah a series of questions. Jehovah patiently answered him. Finally, Abraham came to realize that Jehovah examines the heart of every human and that He never punishes the innocent along with the guilty.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:20-1:18:32" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Gen. 18:20-32</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="103" href="jwpub://p/E:2022526/16-17"><em>w22.08</em> 28 ¶9-10</a></p>

Nehemiah selected, among others, the chief of the Fortress, Hananiah. The Bible describes Hananiah as “a most trustworthy man [who] feared the true God more than many others.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:2-16:7:2" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Neh. 7:2</a>) Love for Jehovah and fear of displeasing him moved Hananiah to take seriously any assignment he was given. Those qualities will also help us to be dependable in our service to God. Note the example of Tychicus, a trusted companion of the apostle Paul. Paul relied on Tychicus, describing him as a “faithful minister.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:21-49:6:22" data-bid="122-1" class="b">Eph. 6:21, 22</a>) Paul trusted him not only to deliver letters to the brothers in Ephesus and Colossae but also to encourage and comfort them.

<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="sb">Joseph faced severe trials that lasted about 13 years. Joseph could have questioned whether Jehovah really loved him. And he could have wondered if Jehovah had abandoned him in his time of need. But Joseph did not become embittered. Instead, he kept his senses by remaining calm. When he had the chance to retaliate against his brothers, he refrained from doing so and showed love for them and forgave them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:45:4-1:45:5" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Gen. 45:4, 5</a>) Joseph behaved this way because he was able to think clearly.

Additionally, when others mistreat you, try to cover over their imperfections with love. <a class="xt" data-xtid="61" href="jwpub://p/E:2022645/10-10"><em>w22.11</em> 21 ¶4</a></p>

Daniel first saw four huge beasts that symbolize past and present world powers​—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome and its modern-day offshoot, Anglo-America. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:1-27:7:3" data-bid="128-1" class="b">Dan. 7:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:17-27:7:17" data-bid="128-2" class="b"> 17</a>) Then Daniel saw Jehovah God sitting enthroned in the heavenly court.
