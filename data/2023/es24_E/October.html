<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We can all contribute to the success of our congregation meetings by raising our voices in song and by giving well-prepared comments. Some find it a challenge to sing or to give a comment in public. Do you? If so, consider what others have done to overcome their fears. As to song, some have found it helps to sing wholeheartedly. When we sing our Kingdom songs, our primary focus should be on our desire to praise Jehovah. So prepare for the songs at home, just as you would prepare for other parts on the meeting and try to identify how the lyrics tie in with the subject being discussed. Also, focus more on the words and less on your singing ability. Commenting can be a real challenge for some. What will help? Try to do so regularly. Remember, it is OK if your answer is short, simple, and to the point. Jehovah greatly appreciates our determination to praise him at congregation meetings. <a class="xt" data-xtid="311" href="jwpub://p/E:2022367/20-23"><em>w22.04</em> 7-8 ¶12-15</a></p>

You will surely agree that this description highlights Jehovah’s willingness​—yes, eagerness—​to be our Helper. With Jehovah on our side, we can endure our trials with joy. What are some ways in which Jehovah helps us? To answer, let us turn to the book of Isaiah. Why? Many of the prophecies Isaiah was inspired to write apply to God’s servants today. Further, Isaiah often describes Jehovah in terms that we can easily understand. Take as an example <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:1-23:30:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 30</a>. There, in language that creates vivid pictures in our mind, Isaiah describes how Jehovah helps us as his people (1) by listening attentively and responding to our prayers, (2) by providing us with guidance, and (3) by giving us blessings now and in the future. <a class="xt" data-xtid="312" href="jwpub://p/E:2022641/7-8"><em>w22.11</em> 8 ¶2-3</a></p>

However, Daniel was also told that Jesus would “stand up” during “a time of distress such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time.” This “time of distress” is the “great tribulation” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21</a>.

We do not discriminate against anyone because of his race, tribe, financial position, or social background. In this way, we are working in harmony with Jehovah’s purpose “that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="101-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>) We also prove our love for God and Christ by showing love for our brothers and sisters. We take a personal interest in them and support them during their trials. We comfort them when they have lost a loved one, visit them when they are sick, and do our best to encourage them when they are disheartened.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Jesus identified an important quality that we need if we are to understand what we read in God’s Word​—discernment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Matt. 24:15</a>) What is discernment? It is the ability to grasp how one idea relates to another and how it differs from another and to see what is not immediately obvious. In addition, as Jesus indicated, we need discernment to identify events that fulfill Bible prophecy. We also need this quality so that we can benefit fully from everything we read in the Bible. Jehovah gives his servants discernment. So turn to him in prayer, and ask him to help you develop this quality. How can you work in harmony with your prayer? Carefully analyze what you read, and note how it relates to other things you know. Look for the meaning of a Bible passage, and see ways in which you can apply it in your life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) As you read with discernment, your understanding of the Scriptures will grow. <a class="xt" data-xtid="342" href="jwpub://p/E:2023281/13-14"><em>w23.02</em> 10 ¶7-8</a></p>

Despite the imperfections, the painting is valued at millions of dollars. Surely you would appreciate and protect that piece of art. Similarly, Jehovah has given us a valuable gift, the gift of life. In fact, Jehovah shows how much he values our life by giving his Son as a ransom for us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="111-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Jehovah is the Source of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9</a>) The apostle Paul acknowledged this truth when he said: “By him we have life and move and exist.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:25-44:17:25" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Acts 17:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:28-44:17:28" data-bid="113-2" class="b"> 28</a>) So we can appropriately refer to our life as a gift from God.

Through its pages, he provides us with wise counsel that can help us to cope successfully with the problems we face today. He also gives us a wonderful hope for the future. More important, Jehovah has used the Bible to reveal many aspects of his personality. As we meditate on his beautiful qualities, our hearts are deeply touched and we are moved to draw close to our God by developing a warm friendship with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:14-19:25:14" data-bid="117-1" class="b">Ps. 25:14</a>) Jehovah wants people to know him. In the past, he revealed himself by such means as dreams, visions, and even angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:6-4:12:6" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Num. 12:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:3-44:10:4" data-bid="118-2" class="b"> Acts 10:3, 4</a>) But how could these dreams, visions, or messages from angels be studied unless they were written down? For good reason, Jehovah had men “write in a book” what he wanted us to know. Because “the way of the true God is perfect,” we can be confident that this method of communicating with us is excellent and beneficial.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:30-19:18:30" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Ps. 18:30</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="344" href="jwpub://p/E:2023280/6-7"><em>w23.02</em> 2 ¶1-2</a></p>
