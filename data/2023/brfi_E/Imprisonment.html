Jehovah’s Witnesses were permitted to share barracks with their fellow believers for a time, but because they held religious meetings, the SS later separated them. However, since they then preached more to other inmates, the SS put the Witnesses together again. Commented an observer: “One cannot escape the impression that, psychologically speaking, the SS were never quite equal to the challenge offered them by Jehovah’s Witnesses.”​—Eugen Kogon.</p>
