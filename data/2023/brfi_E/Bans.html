<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>3</strong> On October 7, 1934, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany and in 50 other countries sent about 20,000 letters and telegrams to the German government protesting the persecution. The telegrams from abroad read as follows: “Hitler government, Berlin, Germany. Your ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses shocks all good people of earth and dishonors God’s name. Refrain from further persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses; otherwise God will destroy you and your national party. Signed, JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES [city or community].”</p>
