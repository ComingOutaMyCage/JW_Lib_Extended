STARTING A CONVERSATION





John 4:6-9



LESSON 1
Interest in Others


Principle: “Love . . . does not look for its own interests.”​—1 Cor. 13:4, 5.


What Jesus Did









VIDEO: Jesus and the Woman at the Well




1. Watch the VIDEO, or read John 4:6-9. Then consider the following questions:
               What did Jesus observe about the woman before starting a conversation?

               Jesus said: “Give me a drink.” Why was this an effective way to begin the conversation?




What Do We Learn From Jesus?
2. We are more likely to have a good conversation if we start with a topic that interests the other person.
Imitate Jesus
3. Be flexible. Do not insist on starting a conversation on a topic you had in mind. Start with something that others are thinking about today. Ask yourself:
               ‘What is in the news?’

               ‘What are my neighbors, coworkers, or classmates talking about?’


4. Be observant. Ask yourself:
               ‘What is the person currently doing? What might he be thinking about?’

               ‘What do the person’s clothing, appearance, or home tell me about his beliefs or culture?’

               ‘Is this a good time to talk to the person?’


5. Listen.
               Don’t talk too much.

               Encourage the other person to express himself. When appropriate, ask questions.
