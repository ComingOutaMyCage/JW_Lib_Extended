<p id="p2" data-pid="2">Dear Brothers and Sisters:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3">Love for God and for people motivates us to “go . . . and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:28-41:12:31" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mark 12:28-31</a>) Unselfish love is powerful. It can touch the hearts of those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">In the past, we focused on memorizing presentations and on leaving literature. Now we need to work on improving our conversation skills. We want to show love for others by talking about subjects that interest <em>them.</em> That means being flexible and carefully considering each person’s concerns and interests. How will this brochure help us do that?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5">The brochure has 12 lessons featuring qualities that we need to cultivate in order to show love and make disciples. Each lesson is based on a Bible account in which Jesus or another first-century evangelizer displayed a specific quality in the ministry. The goal is, not to memorize presentations, but to look for ways to demonstrate our love for people. Although each quality is needed for all aspects of our ministry, we will consider how certain qualities are especially needed when starting conversations, making return visits, or conducting Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6">As you consider each lesson, think carefully about how you can demonstrate the quality when speaking to people in your community. Strive to deepen your love for Jehovah and for people. That love, more than any specific technique, will help you reach your goal of making disciples.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7">We appreciate the great privilege to work shoulder to shoulder with you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:9-36:3:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:9</a>) May Jehovah richly bless you as you continue to love people and make disciples!</p>
