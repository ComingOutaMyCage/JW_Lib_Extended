STARTING A CONVERSATION





Acts 26:2, 3



LESSON 4
Humility


Principle: “With humility consider others superior to you.”​—Phil. 2:3.


What Paul Did









VIDEO: Paul Preaches to King Agrippa




1. Watch the VIDEO, or read Acts 26:2, 3. Then consider the following questions:
               How did Paul show humility in the way he spoke to King Agrippa?

               How did Paul draw attention to Jehovah and the Scriptures rather than to himself?​—See Acts 26:22.




What Do We Learn From Paul?
2. Our message is more appealing when we present it humbly and respectfully.
Imitate Paul
3. Do not be condescending. Avoid giving the impression that you know everything and that the other person knows nothing. Speak with him in a respectful way.
4. Make clear that the Bible is the source of the truths you share. God’s Word contains thoughts that touch people’s hearts. When we use it, we are building their faith on the right foundation.
5. Remain mild. Do not insist on making a point. We do not want to argue. Show humility by staying calm and knowing when to leave. (Prov. 17:14; Titus 3:2) A mild response may leave the door open for a productive conversation in the future.
