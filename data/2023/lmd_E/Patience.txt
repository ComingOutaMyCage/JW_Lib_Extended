What Jesus Did









VIDEO: Jesus Patiently Helps His Brother




1. Watch the VIDEO, or read John 7:3-5 and 1 Corinthians 15:3, 4, 7. Then consider the following questions:
               How did Jesus’ brothers initially respond to his message?

               What shows that Jesus did not give up on his brother James?




What Do We Learn From Jesus?
2. We need to be patient because some people take longer than others to respond to the good news.
Imitate Jesus
3. Try a different approach. If the person does not immediately agree to a Bible study, do not pressure him. When appropriate, use videos or articles to help him understand what happens on a Bible study and how he would benefit.
4. Do not compare. Each person is unique. If a family member or a return visit hesitates to study the Bible or to accept a Bible teaching, consider why that might be the case. Is he emotionally connected to a particular religious belief? Does he face pressure from relatives or neighbors? Allow time for him to think about what you have said and to appreciate what the Bible says.
5. Pray about the interested person. Ask Jehovah to help you remain positive and tactful. Pray for discernment to know when to stop calling on someone who shows little interest.​—1 Cor. 9:26.
