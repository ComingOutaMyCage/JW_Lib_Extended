What Jesus Did









VIDEO: Jesus Heals a Blind Man




1. Watch the VIDEO, or read John 9:1-7. Then consider the following questions:
               What did Jesus do first​—heal the blind man or share the good news with him?​—See John 9:35-38.

               Why might Jesus’ approach have made the man more responsive to the good news?




What Do We Learn From Jesus?
2. A person will be more likely to listen to our message if he senses that we care about him.
Imitate Jesus
3. Empathize with the person. Try to imagine how he feels.
               Ask yourself: ‘What may he be concerned about? What might he find helpful and appealing?’ Doing so will help you to show kindness in a natural and sincere manner.

               Show that you care about what matters to a person by listening. If he tells you how he feels about something or mentions a problem he is facing, do not change the subject.


4. Speak kindly and respectfully. When you feel compassion for the person and truly want to help him, it will come through in the way you speak. Choose your words and tone of voice carefully, and avoid saying things that could offend.
5. Be helpful. Look for appropriate opportunities to help the person in practical ways. Acts of kindness can open the door to a conversation.
