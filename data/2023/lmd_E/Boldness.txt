STARTING A CONVERSATION





Luke 19:1-7



LESSON 6
Boldness


Principle: “We mustered up boldness by means of our God to tell you the good news.”​—1 Thess. 2:2.


What Jesus Did









VIDEO: Jesus Preaches to Zacchaeus




1. Watch the VIDEO, or read Luke 19:1-7. Then consider the following questions:
               Why might some people have avoided Zacchaeus?

               What moved Jesus to share the good news with him anyway?




What Do We Learn From Jesus?
2. We need boldness to preach the Kingdom message impartially.
Imitate Jesus
3. Rely on Jehovah. God’s spirit empowered Jesus to preach, and it can empower you too. (Matt. 10:19, 20; Luke 4:18) Ask Jehovah for boldness to preach to those you might find intimidating.​—Acts 4:29.
4. Do not prejudge people. We may hesitate to approach some people because of their physical appearance, social or economic status, lifestyle, or religious beliefs. But remember:
               Jehovah and Jesus can read hearts; we cannot.

               No one is beyond the reach of Jehovah’s mercy.


5. Balance boldness with tact and caution. (Matt. 10:16) Avoid arguing. Politely end the conversation if the person is unreceptive to the good news or if you feel unsafe.​—Prov. 17:14.
