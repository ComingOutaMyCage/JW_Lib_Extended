APPENDIX B

Should You End the Conversation?


When someone raises a sincere question or concern, we are happy to continue the conversation. We want to speak with people who may be “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”​—Acts 13:48.
But what if a person is angry, wants to argue, or does not want to talk right now? Calmly and tactfully end the conversation. (Prov. 17:14) Try to leave on good terms so that the person may be willing to converse with us in the future.​—1 Pet. 2:12.
