TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“If a Man Dies, Can He Live Again?”




Humans are powerless to prevent death or restore life (Job 14:1, 2, 4, 10; w99 10/15 3 ¶1-3)
The dead can live again (Job 14:7-9; w15 4/15 32 ¶1-2)
Not only does Jehovah have the ability to resurrect his servants but he also has a longing to do so (Job 14:14, 15; w11 3/1 22 ¶5)





FOR MEDITATION: Why does Jehovah long to resurrect his loyal servants? How does this make you feel about Jehovah?
