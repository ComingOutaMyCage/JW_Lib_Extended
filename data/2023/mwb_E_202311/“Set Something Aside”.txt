LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
“Set Something Aside”




We should not leave voluntary donations to chance. Instead, as the apostle Paul recommended, we should regularly “set something aside.” (1Co 16:2) Following this inspired advice helps us to advance pure worship and brings us joy. No matter how insignificant our personal donations may seem to us, Jehovah greatly appreciates the fact that we want to honor him with our valuable things.​—Pr 3:9.
