Integrity Does Not Require Perfection




Job wrongly criticized God (Job 27:1, 2)
Although Job made mistakes, he could view himself as a man of integrity (Job 27:5; it-1 1210 ¶4)
Integrity requires wholehearted love for Jehovah, not perfection (Mt 22:37; w19.02 3 ¶3-5)





FOR MEDITATION: How does knowing that Jehovah does not require us to be perfect help us not to give up?
