TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Righteousness Is Not Defined by Wealth




Zophar contended that God removes the wealth of the wicked, implying that Job must have sinned (Job 20:5, 10, 15)
Job countered: ‘Then why do the wicked prosper?’ (Job 21:7-9)
Jesus’ example proves that the righteous may not have material wealth (Lu 9:58)





FOR MEDITATION: Whether he is rich or poor, what is a righteous person’s priority?​—Lu 12:21; w07 8/1 29 ¶12.
