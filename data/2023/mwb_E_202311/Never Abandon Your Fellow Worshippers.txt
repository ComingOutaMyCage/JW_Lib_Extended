TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Never Abandon Your Fellow Worshippers




Job’s relatives stopped associating with him (Job 19:13)
Young children and Job’s servants stopped showing him respect (Job 19:16, 18)
Job’s close friends turned against him (Job 19:19)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I continue to show love for a fellow worshipper who is in a distressing situation?’​—Pr 17:17; w22.01 16 ¶9; w21.09 30 ¶16; w90 9/1 22 ¶20.
