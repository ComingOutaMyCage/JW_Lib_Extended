Eliphaz Demonstrates How Not to Give Comfort




Eliphaz told Job that humans could never please God (Job 15:14-16; w05 9/15 26 ¶4-5)
Eliphaz implied that Job was wicked and that this was why he was suffering (Job 15:20)
Eliphaz’ words did not comfort Job (Job 16:1, 2)





What Eliphaz said to Job was a lie. Jehovah values our efforts to serve him. (Ps 149:4) Even the righteous can expect to experience problems.​—Ps 34:19.
FOR MEDITATION: How can we “speak consolingly to those who are depressed”?​—1Th 5:14; w15 2/15 9 ¶16.
