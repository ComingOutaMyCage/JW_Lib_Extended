LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Integrity and Our Thoughts




We demonstrate integrity not just by what we say and do but also by what we think about. (Ps 19:14) Therefore, the Bible urges us to think about whatever things are true, of serious concern, righteous, chaste, lovable, well-spoken-of, virtuous, and praiseworthy. (Php 4:8) Of course, we cannot always prevent wrong thoughts from entering our mind. However, self-control can help us to push a bad thought out and replace it with a wholesome one. Maintaining integrity in our thinking will help us to maintain integrity in our actions.​—Mr 7:21-23.
