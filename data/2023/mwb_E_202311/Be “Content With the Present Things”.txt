LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Be “Content With the Present Things”




If we have little materially, we could be tempted to make compromises that could be damaging to our spirituality. For example, we may receive an opportunity to make a lot of money that comes at a spiritual cost. Meditating on Hebrews 13:5 will help us.
“Let your way of life be free of the love of money”
Prayerfully examine your attitude toward money, and think about the example you are setting for your children.​—g 9/15 6.


“While you are content with the present things”
Adjust your view of what you truly need.​—w16.07 7 ¶1-2.


“I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you”
Trust that Jehovah will help you to obtain life’s necessities if you continue to put the Kingdom first.​—w14 4/15 21 ¶17.
