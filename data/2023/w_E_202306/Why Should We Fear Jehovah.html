<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHAT qualities, do you think, are essential if you want to maintain a close friendship with someone? You would likely answer that good friends should love and support each other. You probably would not think of fear as an important quality for a good friendship. However, as the theme text for this article states, those who want to have a close friendship with Jehovah must “fear him.”​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:14-19:25:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 25:14</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> Describe what causes us to experience fear and how we may be affected.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> We may experience fear if we believe that we could suffer some kind of harm. This type of fear can be healthy and can move us to act wisely. Fear of falling holds us back from walking too close to the edge of a cliff. Fear of injury may impel us to run from a dangerous situation. Fear of damaging our friendship with someone <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>we love keeps us from saying or doing something unkind.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> What kind of fear of Jehovah does Satan want us to have?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Satan wants people to have an unhealthy fear of Jehovah. Satan promotes the idea expressed by Eliphaz​—that Jehovah is a vengeful, angry God who is impossible to please. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:4:18-18:4:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 4:18, 19</a>) Satan wants us to become so afraid of Jehovah that we stop serving Him. To avoid that trap, we need to develop a proper fear of God.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What does it mean to fear God?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> A person who has a proper fear of God loves Him and does not want to do anything that would damage his relationship with Him. Jesus had such “godly fear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:7-58:5:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 5:7</a>) He did not feel a morbid dread of Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:2-23:11:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 11:2, 3</a>) Instead, he felt a deep love for him and wanted to obey him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:21-43:14:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 14:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:31-43:14:31" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 31</a>) Like Jesus, we feel deep respect and awe for Jehovah because He is loving, wise, just, and powerful. We also know that Jehovah loves us very much and is affected by how we respond to his guidance. We can either make Jehovah feel pain or make his heart rejoice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:41-19:78:41" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 78:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Prov. 27:11</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> We are not born with a fear of Jehovah; we must cultivate it. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:11-19:34:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 34:11</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> One way we can do that is by examining creation. The more we see God’s wisdom, his power, and his deep love for us as expressed in “the things made,” the deeper our respect and love for him will be. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>) A sister named Adrienne said, “Jehovah’s wisdom as seen in creation amazes me and helps me realize that he knows what is best for me.” Her meditation led her to this conclusion, “Why would I want to do anything that would put a barrier between me and Jehovah, the Source of my life?” Can you spend some time this week thinking about an aspect of creation? Doing so will deepen your respect and love for Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:2-19:111:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 111:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> How can prayer help us to develop a healthy fear of Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Another way we can develop our fear of God is by praying regularly. The more we pray, the more real Jehovah becomes to us. Each time we ask him for strength to endure a trial, we are reminded of his awesome power. When we thank him for the gift of his Son, we remind ourselves of Jehovah’s love for us. And when we supplicate Jehovah for his help with a problem, we impress on our heart just how wise he is. Such prayers deepen our respect for Jehovah. And they strengthen our resolve to avoid doing anything that would damage our friendship with him.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> What can we do to maintain our fear of God?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> We can maintain our fear of God by studying the Bible with the goal of learning from both the good examples and the bad examples that it contains. Let us discuss two faithful servants of Jehovah​—King Ahab’s household steward Obadiah and High Priest Jehoiada. Then we will see what we can learn from King Jehoash of Judah, who started off well but later left Jehovah.</p>

For one thing, it made him honest and trustworthy; hence, the king put him in charge of the royal household. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:2-16:7:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Nehemiah 7:2</a>.) Obadiah’s godly fear also gave him extraordinary courage​—a quality that he surely needed. He lived during the reign of wicked King Ahab, who “was worse in the eyes of Jehovah than all those [kings] who were prior to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:16:30-11:16:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Ki. 16:30</a>) Also, Ahab’s Baal-worshipping wife, Jezebel, hated Jehovah so much that she tried to wipe out true worship in the northern kingdom. She even killed many of God’s prophets. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:4-11:18:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Ki. 18:4</a>) Without doubt, Obadiah worshipped Jehovah during a difficult time.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> How did Obadiah display extraordinary courage?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> How did Obadiah display extraordinary courage? When Jezebel began hunting down God’s prophets to put them to death, Obadiah took 100 of them and hid them “by groups of 50 in a cave and kept supplying them bread and water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:13-11:18:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Ki. 18:13, 14</a>) If discovered, courageous Obadiah would surely have been executed. Of course, Obadiah was human, and he did not want to die. But Obadiah loved Jehovah and those who served Him more than he loved his own life.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:21-40:22:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 22:21</a>) They demonstrate their fear of God by obeying him rather than men. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>) They do this by continuing to proclaim the good news and by discreetly meeting together.

Consider the example of Henri, who lives in an African land where our work was banned for a time. During the ban, Henri volunteered to distribute spiritual food to his fellow Witnesses. He wrote: “I am shy by nature. So I am convinced that it was the deep respect I feel for Jehovah that gave me the courage I needed.” Can you see yourself being as courageous as Henri was? You can be if you develop a healthy fear of God.</p>

She was ruthless and so greedy for power that she tried to murder the entire royal line​—her own grandsons! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:22:10-14:22:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Chron. 22:10, 11</a>) One of those children​—Jehoash—​survived because Jehoiada’s wife, Jehoshabeath, rescued him.

He formed a plan. If it succeeded, Jehoash would become king, David’s rightful heir. If the plan failed, however, Jehoiada would almost certainly lose his life. With Jehovah’s blessing, the plan succeeded. Jehoiada, supported by the chieftains and the Levites, made Jehoash king and had Athaliah executed.
