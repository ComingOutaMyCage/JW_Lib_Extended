He “was greatly distressed by the brazen conduct of the lawless people,” knowing that our heavenly Father hates bad conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:7-61:2:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:7, 8</a>) Fear of God and love for him moved Lot to reject the low moral standards of the people around him. We too are surrounded by people who have little or no respect for Jehovah’s moral standards. Despite that, we can remain morally clean if we maintain our love for God and cultivate a healthy fear of him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:2-20:14:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 14:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> A key reason to protect our figurative heart is that Jehovah examines our heart. This means that he looks past what we appear to be to others and sees who we really are on the inside. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:3-20:17:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 17:3</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> He will love us if we fill our mind with his life-giving wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:14-43:4:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 4:14</a>) We will thereby leave no room for the moral and spiritual poison coming from Satan and his world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:18-62:5:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 5:18, 19</a>) As we draw closer to Jehovah, our love and respect for him will grow. Because we do not want to hurt our Father, <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>we will hate even the very thought of sinning. When tempted to do wrong, we will ask, ‘How could I deliberately hurt Someone who has shown me so much love?’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> How did fear of Jehovah protect a sister from giving in to temptation?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Marta, a sister in Croatia who was tempted to commit immorality, wrote: “I found it hard to think clearly and to suppress the urge to enjoy the temporary pleasure of sin. But fear of Jehovah protected me.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> How did fear of God do that? Marta said that she meditated on the consequences that a bad decision would bring. We can do the same. The worst consequence is that we will sadden Jehovah and not be in line to worship him forever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:5-1:6:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 6:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What can you learn from Leo’s experience?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> When we fear Jehovah, we are careful not to excuse bad behavior. Leo, who lives in Congo, learned that lesson. Four years after his baptism, he got involved with bad association. He thought that as long as he personally did not engage in bad practices, he was not sinning against Jehovah. Soon, though, his bad associates led him to abuse alcohol and to commit immorality. He then began to reflect on what his Christian parents had taught him and on the happiness that he had lost. The result? He came to his senses. With help from the elders, he returned to Jehovah. Today he serves happily as an elder and a special pioneer.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What two figurative women will we now discuss?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Let us consider <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:1-20:9:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs chapter 9</a>, <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>where we read about wisdom and foolishness, personified as two women.

As we do so, bear in mind that Satan’s world is obsessed with immoral sex and pornography. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:19-49:4:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 4:19</a>) So it is vital that we continue to cultivate godly fear and turn away from bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:6-20:16:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 16:6</a>) Consequently, all of us, whether male or female, can benefit from what this chapter presents. Each of the two women is described as extending an invitation to the inexperienced​—those “lacking good sense.” Each says, as it were, ‘Come into my house and have a meal.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:1-20:9:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 9:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:5-20:9:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:13-20:9:13" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:16-20:9:17" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 16, 17</a>) But there is a vast difference in the results, or outcomes, presented.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Consider the invitation from the “stupid woman.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:13-20:9:18" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 9:13-18</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> She boldly calls out to those lacking good sense, “Come in here” and feast. With what result? “Those powerless in death are there.” You may recall similar figurative language found earlier in Proverbs. We are warned about “the wayward” and “immoral woman.” We are told: “Her house sinks down into death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:11-20:2:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 2:11-19</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:3-20:5:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:3-10</a> contains an alert about another “wayward woman” whose “feet descend into death.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> What choice is presented?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Those hearing the “stupid woman” face a choice: Will they accept her invitation or reject it? We might find ourselves facing such a choice. When confronted with sexual immorality or pornography, as is featured in the media and on the Internet, what will we choose?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>9-10.</strong> What are some reasons why we should avoid sexually immoral conduct?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> There are valid reasons why we should avoid sexually immoral conduct. The “stupid woman” is described as saying: “Stolen waters are sweet.” What are “stolen waters”? The Bible likens sexual intimacies that a married couple may enjoy to refreshing water. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:15-20:5:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 5:15-18</a>) Husband and wife can find pleasure in appropriate sexual acts within their legal marriage. How different, though, with “stolen waters.” That may refer to <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>illicit, immoral sex. Such often occurs in secret, just as a thief often steals in secret. The “stolen waters” may seem particularly sweet if those involved feel that they are getting away with their sinful course. What a sad deception! Jehovah sees all. Nothing could be more bitter than losing his favor, so there is nothing “sweet” about that tragic loss. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9, 10</a>) But there is more.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Sexual immorality can cause shame, a sense of worthlessness, unwanted pregnancies, and broken families. Clearly, it is the course of wisdom to avoid the stupid woman’s “house” and the meal. In addition to facing spiritual death, many immoral people contract diseases that lead to a premature literal death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:23-20:7:23" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 7:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:26-20:7:26" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 26</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:18-20:9:18" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Verse 18 of chapter 9</a> concludes: “Her guests are in the depths of the Grave.” Why, then, do many accept her deceptive invitation that leads to tragedy?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:13-20:9:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Prov. 9:13-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> Why is viewing pornography extremely harmful?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> A common trap is pornography. Some think that viewing pornography is harmless. On the contrary, pornography is harmful, degrading, and addictive. Immoral images have staying power; they are difficult to erase from the mind. What is more, pornography does not deaden wrong desires; it inflames them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Col. 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:14, 15</a>) Yes, many who view pornography go on to commit immoral acts.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> How do we show that we are on guard against sexually arousing images?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> What should we as Christians do if a pornographic image shows up on our electronic device? We should immediately reject the image. We can be helped to take such action if we recall that our most treasured possession is our relationship with Jehovah. Actually, images that are not generally considered pornographic might be sexually arousing. Why avoid them? Because we do not want to take even a small step toward committing adultery in our heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:28-40:5:29" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 5:28, 29</a>) An elder in Thailand named David says: “I ask myself: ‘Even though the images may not be pornographic, will Jehovah be pleased if I keep looking at them?’ This kind of reasoning helps me to act wisely.”</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong> What helps us to act wisely?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> We are helped to act wisely by cultivating a healthy fear of displeasing Jehovah. Godly fear is “the beginning,” or foundation, “of wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:10-20:9:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Prov. 9:10</a>) This is illustrated positively in the opening part of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:1-20:9:18" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs chapter 9</a>, where we read about the other figurative woman, identified as “true wisdom.”</p>

The account mentions that this figurative woman has fully prepared her meat, mixed her wine, and arranged her table in her house.

Jehovah wants his children to be wise and safe. He does not want us to learn life’s lessons the hard way​—through bitter experience and with nagging regrets. That is why “he treasures up practical wisdom for the upright.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:7-20:2:7" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Prov. 2:7</a>) When we have a healthy fear of Jehovah, we will want to please him.
