But the study edition of <em>The Watchtower</em> often includes secondary articles that contain spiritual food. How can you find these articles and benefit from them, using <em>JW Library?</em></p>
<ul><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="su">  At the end of each <em>Watchtower</em> study article, there is the subheading “Additional Reading.” Under that subheading, tap the link “Other articles in this issue.” Review the table of contents, noting how study articles are clearly identified and numbered. Tap the title of a secondary article that you wish to read.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">  On the Home tab of <em>JW Library</em> in the section “What’s New,” download each new issue of <em>The Watchtower</em> when it appears. Open the downloaded magazine and browse the table of contents to make sure that you benefit from all the articles.</p>
