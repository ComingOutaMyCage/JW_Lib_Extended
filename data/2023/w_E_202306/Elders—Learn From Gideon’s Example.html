<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>CHRISTIAN elders have been entrusted with the care of Jehovah’s precious sheep. These devoted men treasure their privilege to serve their brothers and sisters, and they work hard to be “shepherds who . . . really shepherd.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:4-24:23:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 23:4</a>; <strong>read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 5:2</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> How thankful we are to have such men in our congregations!</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong> What tests may some elders face?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> In caring for their responsibilities, elders face many challenges. For one thing, caring for a congregation involves a great deal of work. Tony, an elder in the United States, had to learn to be more modest when it came to the amount of work he accepted. He explains: “At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I took on more and more work to organize meetings and the ministry. But no matter how much I did, there was always more to do. Eventually, my Bible reading, personal study, and prayer started to slip.” Ilir, an elder in Kosovo, faced a different challenge. When he was in a war zone, he found it difficult to obey theocratic direction. He says: “My courage was tested when the branch office offered me an assignment to help the brothers and sisters in a dangerous area. I was afraid, and the direction did not seem practical.” Tim, a missionary in Asia, found it hard just to keep up with the pace day after day. He says: “At times, I felt mentally and emotionally exhausted.” What can help elders who are facing similar challenges?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> How can all benefit from considering the example of Judge Gideon?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Elders can learn from the example of Judge Gideon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:12-58:6:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 6:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:32-58:11:32" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11:32</a>) He was both a protector and a shepherd of God’s people.

His endurance was tested as he carried out his assignments. Whether we serve as an elder or not, we can grow in appreciation for our elders. We can support these hardworking spiritual men.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 13:17</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> How did Gideon show modesty and humility?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Gideon was a modest and humble man.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> When Jehovah’s angel told Gideon that he had been chosen to deliver Israel from the powerful Midianites, that humble man replied: “My clan is the least in Manasseh, and I am the most insignificant in my father’s house.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:15-7:6:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Judg. 6:15</a>) He felt unqualified for the assignment, but Jehovah knew better. With Jehovah’s help, Gideon completed his assignment successfully.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> How may an elder’s modesty and humility be tested?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Elders do their best to display modesty and humility in all things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mic. 6:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:18-44:20:19" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Acts 20:18, 19</a>) They do not exaggerate their abilities or accomplishments; nor do they beat themselves up for their flaws or failings. Nevertheless, an elder may face tests. For example, he may accept a number of assignments and then find it difficult to fulfill them all. Or he may be criticized for the way he handled one assignment or praised for the way he handled another assignment. What can elders learn from Gideon that will help them in such situations?</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What can elders learn about modesty from Gideon? (See also picture.)</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Ask for help.</em></strong> A person who is modest is aware of his personal limitations. <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Gideon was modest in being willing to ask others for help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:27-7:6:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Judg. 6:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:35-7:6:35" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:24-7:7:24" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 7:24</a>) Wise elders do similarly. Tony, quoted earlier, explains: “Because of my upbringing, I tended to accept more work than I could reasonably handle. So I decided to include the topic of modesty in our family worship and get my wife’s observations. I also reviewed on jw.org the video <a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?lank=pub-jwbcov_201505_9_VIDEO&amp;wtlocale=E" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=jwbcov&amp;issue=201505&amp;track=9"><em>Train, Trust, and Empower Others, as Jesus Does</em></a><em>.”</em> Tony began to invite others to help with his workload. The result? Tony says: “The work in the congregation is being cared for, and I have more time to build myself up spiritually.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> If criticized, how can elders imitate Gideon? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:13-59:3:13" data-bid="37-1" class="b">James 3:13</a>)</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Respond mildly if criticized.</em></strong> Another test for elders comes if they are criticized. Again, Gideon’s example can help. No doubt aware of his own imperfections, he responded mildly when the Ephraimites criticized him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:1-7:8:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Judg. 8:1-3</a>) Gideon did not reply in anger. He showed lowliness of mind by listening to their concerns, and he tactfully defused the tense situation. Wise elders imitate Gideon by listening carefully and responding mildly if criticized. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:13-59:3:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>James 3:13</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> They thus contribute to the peace in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How should appointed men respond if they receive praise? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Direct praise to Jehovah.</em></strong> When Gideon was honored for the victory over Midian, he focused the attention on Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:22-7:8:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Judg. 8:22, 23</a>) How might appointed men imitate Gideon? They can credit Jehovah for what they accomplish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:6-46:4:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:6, 7</a>) For example, if an elder is commended for his teaching ability, he can direct attention to the source of the instruction, God’s Word, or to the training we receive from Jehovah’s organization. Elders might at times reflect on whether they are drawing undue attention to themselves. Consider the experience of an elder named Timothy. When newly appointed, Timothy loved giving public talks. He says: “I would come up with elaborate introductions and illustrations. These often drew praise from others. Unfortunately, the attention tended to be on me instead of on the Bible or Jehovah.” In time, Timothy saw the need to adjust his teaching style in order to avoid drawing undue attention to himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:21-20:27:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 27:21</a>) With what result? He explains: “Different ones tell me how my talk has helped them to cope with a problem, to endure a trial, or to draw closer to Jehovah. I get more joy from those comments than I ever did from the praise that was directed to me years ago.”</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> After Gideon was appointed as judge, his obedience and courage were tested. He was given the dangerous assignment to destroy his father’s Baal altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:25-7:6:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Judg. 6:25, 26</a>) Later, after gathering an army, Gideon was twice directed to reduce its size. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:2-7:7:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Judg. 7:2-7</a>) Finally, he was told to attack the enemy camp in the dead of night.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:9-7:7:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judg. 7:9-11</a>.</p>

He thus sets a good example for others. Still, his obedience may be tested. He may, for instance, find it hard to keep up with the direction he receives. In some cases, he may wonder whether certain direction is really practical or wise. Or he may be asked to take on an assignment that could put his freedom at risk. How can elders imitate Gideon’s obedience in such situations?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> What can help elders to be obedient?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Listen carefully to direction and apply it.</em></strong> God told Gideon how to destroy his father’s altar, where to build a new altar to Jehovah, and which animal to sacrifice. Gideon did not try to second-guess the direction​—he just followed it. Today, elders receive instructions from Jehovah’s organization by means of letters, announcements, and guidelines related to our spiritual and physical welfare. We love our elders for faithfully following theocratic direction. The whole congregation benefits.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:112-19:119:112" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 119:112</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Be willing to adjust.</em></strong> Recall that at Jehovah’s request, Gideon reduced his army by more than 99 percent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:8-7:7:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Judg. 7:8</a>) He may have thought: ‘Is this change really necessary? Will this work?’ Nevertheless, Gideon obeyed. Elders today imitate Gideon by implementing recommended changes in theocratic direction. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 13:17</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> As an example, in 2014 the Governing Body changed the way Kingdom Hall and Assembly Hall construction projects are financed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:12-47:8:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:12-14</a>) Congregations would no longer repay a loan. Instead, congregations worldwide would pool their resources so that theocratic facilities could be constructed wherever they were needed, regardless of the local congregation’s ability to pay. When José learned of the change, he doubted that it would work, thinking: ‘Not even one Kingdom Hall will ever be built. This is not how things are done in this part of the world.’ What helped José to support the direction? He says: “The words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a> reminded me to trust in Jehovah. And the results have been wonderful! Not only are we building more Kingdom Halls but we have learned to contribute in different ways so that an equalizing takes place.”</p>
