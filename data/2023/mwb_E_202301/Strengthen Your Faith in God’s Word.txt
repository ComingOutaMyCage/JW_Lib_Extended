LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Strengthen Your Faith in God’s Word




God’s Word can transform our lives. (Heb 4:12) However, to benefit from its guidance, direction, and counsel, we need to be convinced that it is indeed “the word of God.” (1Th 2:13) How can we strengthen our faith in the Bible?
Read a portion of the Bible each day. As you read, look for evidence that Jehovah is its Author. For example, examine the advice contained in the book of Proverbs and take note of its timeless wisdom.​—Pr 13:20; 14:30.
Start a study project. Become familiar with evidence that proves that the Bible is inspired. In the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses, look under the subject “The Bible” and then “Inspired by God.” You can also strengthen your faith that the Bible’s message has not changed by examining the information contained in Appendix A3 of the New World Translation.
