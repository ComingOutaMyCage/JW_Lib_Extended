TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Maintain Your Joy Despite Disappointments




David longed to build a beautiful temple for Jehovah (1Ch 17:1, 2; w06 7/15 19 ¶1)
Jehovah told David that he would not be the one to build the temple (1Ch 17:4)
David remained absorbed in the work that Jehovah had assigned him (1Ch 17:7; 18:14)





If because of age, health, or other factors you are not eligible for a certain assignment, stay absorbed in the things that you can do.​—Ac 18:5; w21.08 22-23 ¶11.
