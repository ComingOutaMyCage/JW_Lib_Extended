TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Following Direction Leads to Success




David wanted to bring the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem (1Ch 13:3)
He was unsuccessful when he allowed the ark to be transported improperly (1Ch 15:13; w03 5/1 10-11)
David succeeded when he searched for Jehovah’s direction (1Ch 15:2; 16:11; w03 5/1 11 ¶13)
Jehovah appreciates our good motives. However, for our actions to be acceptable to Jehovah, we must follow direction.​—De 30:16.
