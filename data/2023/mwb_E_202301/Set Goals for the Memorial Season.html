<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Each year, Jehovah’s people look forward to observing the Memorial together. During the weeks before and after the Memorial, we take advantage of special opportunities to give praise and thanks to Jehovah for the gift of the ransom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:3-49:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph 1:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 7</a>) For example, we put our heart into inviting others to the Memorial. Some are able to make adjustments so that they can auxiliary pioneer with the goal of 30 or 50 hours during the months of March or April. Would you like to increase your share in the ministry during this Memorial season? What can help you to succeed?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Often, we can accomplish more when we plan ahead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Pr 21:5</a>) With the Memorial season fast approaching, now is the time to start planning. Consider how you would like to expand your ministry during the Memorial season, and reflect on what you need to do to reach your goals. Then ask Jehovah to bless your efforts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Jo 5:14, 15</a>.</p>
