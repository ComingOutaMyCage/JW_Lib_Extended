LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Search for God’s Thinking




We want to please Jehovah in all that we do. (Pr 27:11) To do so, we need to make decisions that reflect his thinking even when there is no clear-cut law or command to guide us. What can help us to do that?
Maintain a regular routine of Bible study. Each time we read the Bible, it is as if we were spending time with Jehovah. We can learn about Jehovah’s way of thinking by observing how he dealt with his people and by examining the examples of those who did good or bad in his eyes. When we need to make a decision, holy spirit can recall to our mind important lessons and principles that we have learned from God’s Word.​—Joh 14:26.
Do research. When you face a decision, ask yourself, ‘What verses or accounts in the Bible can help me to understand how Jehovah feels about the matter?’ Pray for Jehovah’s help, and use the theocratic research tools available in your language to help you to find and apply Bible principles that are relevant to your situation.​—Ps 25:4.
