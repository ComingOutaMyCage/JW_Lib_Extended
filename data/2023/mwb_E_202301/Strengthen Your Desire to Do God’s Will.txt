TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Strengthen Your Desire to Do God’s Will




Because Saul was disobedient, Jehovah rejected him (1Ch 10:13, 14)
Jehovah chose David to become king in Saul’s place (1Ch 11:3)
Unlike Saul, David let himself be guided by Jehovah’s laws and principles (1Ch 11:15-19; w12 11/15 6 ¶12-13)
David loved doing God’s will. (Ps 40:8) We can cultivate a similar desire to do what is right by learning to view things the way Jehovah does.​—Ps 25:4; w18.06 17 ¶5-6.
