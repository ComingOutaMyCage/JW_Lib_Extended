TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
The Bible​—A Book of Fact, Not Fiction




[Play the video Introduction to 1 Chronicles.]
Adam was a real person (1Ch 1:1; w09 9/1 14 ¶1)
Noah was also a real person (1Ch 1:4; w08 6/1 3 ¶4)





When we understand that people in the Bible are, not mythical characters, but real people, we better appreciate the lessons we learn from their example.​—1Co 15:22; w09 9/1 14-15.
