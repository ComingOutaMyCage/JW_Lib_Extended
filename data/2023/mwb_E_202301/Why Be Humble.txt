TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Why Be Humble?




Josiah was eager to please Jehovah (2Ki 22:1-5)
He humbly admitted the errors of the people (2Ki 22:13; w00 9/15 29-30)
Because Josiah was humble, Jehovah blessed him (2Ki 22:18-20; w00 9/15 30 ¶2)
We gain Jehovah’s favor when we humbly turn to him for guidance and when we admit our mistakes and correct our path.​—Jas 4:6.
