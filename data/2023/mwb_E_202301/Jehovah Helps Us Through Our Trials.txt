LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Jehovah Helps Us Through Our Trials




During these last days, we experience many difficult trials. At times, we may feel that our trials are too much for us to bear. However, if we continue to draw close to Jehovah, he will help us to endure even the most heartbreaking of trials. (Isa 43:2, 4) How can we draw close to Jehovah when we go through trials?
Prayer. When we pour our heart out to Jehovah, he gives us the peace and emotional strength to endure.​—Php 4:6, 7; 1Th 5:17.
Meetings. More than ever, we need the spiritual food and association that Jehovah provides at our meetings. (Heb 10:24, 25) When we prepare for, attend, and participate in congregation meetings, we take full advantage of the help of Jehovah’s spirit.​—Re 2:29.
Ministry. We will find it easier to focus on positive things if we do everything we can to remain active in the ministry. We will also strengthen our bonds of friendship with Jehovah and our fellow workers.​—1Co 3:5-10.
