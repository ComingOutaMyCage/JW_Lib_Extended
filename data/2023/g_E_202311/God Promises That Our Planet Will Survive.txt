God Promises That Our Planet Will Survive

“The Earth is more resilient than we thought.”




That was the conclusion reached regarding climate change by an international team of researchers. If you believe in a Creator who cares for mankind, this scientific conclusion may remind you of the many self-healing natural processes that God built into our planet’s design.
Still, given the degree of man-made damage to the earth, more than natural processes is needed for our planet to survive. Why can we be confident that God will do something about it?
Note the scriptures listed in the box that assure us that the earth will survive and even thrive.
