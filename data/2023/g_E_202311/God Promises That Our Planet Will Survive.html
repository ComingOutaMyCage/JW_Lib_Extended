<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Note the scriptures listed in the box that assure us that the earth will survive and even thrive.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  <strong>Our planet was created by God.</strong> “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a></p>

</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">  <strong>God promises that life will thrive on our planet forever.</strong> “The true God, the One who formed the earth, . . . did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a></p>
