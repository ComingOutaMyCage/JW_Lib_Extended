LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Are You Prepared for an Economic Crisis?




We are not shocked when world events create unstable economic conditions internationally. Why not? Because we are living deep in the last days and the Bible warns us not to place our hope in “uncertain riches.” (1Ti 6:17; 2Ti 3:1) What can King Jehoshaphat’s example teach us about being prepared for an economic crisis?
When faced with a threat from enemy nations, Jehoshaphat trusted in Jehovah. (2Ch 20:9-12) He also took practical measures to prepare the nation beforehand by fortifying cities and setting up garrisons. (2Ch 17:1, 2, 12, 13) Like Jehoshaphat, we do well to trust in Jehovah and take practical steps to face difficult times.
WHAT CAN WE DO TO PREPARE FOR AN ECONOMIC CRISIS?
Prepare spiritually: Cultivate contentment, and strengthen your trust in Jehovah’s ability to provide for your daily needs. (Mt 6:26; 1Ti 6:8) Be resolved never to compromise Bible principles to satisfy those needs. (Ro 2:21) Consider how you would obtain spiritual food if electricity or the Internet were disrupted. Keep a few selected hard-copy publications on hand, and if possible, download electronic publications in advance.
Prepare materially: Reduce debt and unnecessary expenses before economic problems arise. (Pr 22:7) If possible, store a reasonable supply of food and other necessary items. Some may consider planting and maintaining a vegetable garden to save money.
