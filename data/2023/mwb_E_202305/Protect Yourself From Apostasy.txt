LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Protect Yourself From Apostasy




Satan and those under his influence often mix lies with truths in an attempt to undermine our faith. (2Co 11:3) For example, the Assyrians used half-truths and outright lies to discourage Jehovah’s people. (2Ch 32:10-15) Apostates use similar tactics today. How should we react to apostate teachings? Treat them as the poison they are! Never read them, reply to them, or repeat them. Be quick to detect information that is designed to raise doubts about Jehovah and his organization​—and reject it!​—Jude 3, 4.
