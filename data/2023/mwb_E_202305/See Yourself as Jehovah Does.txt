LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
See Yourself as Jehovah Does




“Jehovah takes pleasure in his people.” (Ps 149:4) Although we are imperfect, he sees our good qualities and potential. At times, however, we may find it difficult to have such a balanced view of ourselves. We may struggle with feelings of low self-worth because of the way that others treat us. Or, if we focus on past mistakes, we may doubt whether Jehovah could really love us. What can help us when we experience such feelings?
Remember that Jehovah sees beyond what humans see. (1Sa 16:7) That means that he even sees beyond what we see in ourselves. Thankfully, the Bible provides a window into how Jehovah views us. We can peer through that window by considering Bible verses and accounts that reveal how much Jehovah loves his worshippers.
