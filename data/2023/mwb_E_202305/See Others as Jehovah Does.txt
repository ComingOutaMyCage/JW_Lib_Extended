See Others as Jehovah Does




King Jehoshaphat made an unwise alliance with King Ahab (2Ch 18:1-3; w17.03 24 ¶7)
Jehovah sent Jehu to reprove Jehoshaphat (2Ch 19:1, 2)
Jehovah remembered the good things that Jehoshaphat had done (2Ch 19:3; w15 8/15 11-12 ¶8-9)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘Do I look beyond the imperfections of my brothers and sisters and focus on their good qualities as Jehovah does?’
