Jehovah Rewards Courageous Acts




Jehoshabeath and her husband, Jehoiada, protected Jehoash from Athaliah (2Ch 22:11, 12; w09 4/1 24 ¶1-2)
Jehoiada courageously took action to make Jehoash king (2Ch 23:1-11, 14, 15; w09 4/1 24 ¶3-5)
Jehoiada was given the exceptional honor of being buried with the kings (2Ch 24:15, 16; it-1 379 ¶5)
FOR MEDITATION: In what areas of my worship would I like to show more courage?
