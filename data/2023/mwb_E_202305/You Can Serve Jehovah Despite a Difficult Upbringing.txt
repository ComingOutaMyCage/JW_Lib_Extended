TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
You Can Serve Jehovah Despite a Difficult Upbringing




Hezekiah’s father, King Ahaz, did detestable things (2Ch 28:1; w16.02 14 ¶8)
Hezekiah chose to serve Jehovah despite his father’s bad example (2Ch 29:1-3; w16.02 14 ¶9-11)
Hezekiah encouraged others not to let the unfaithfulness of their fathers stop them from serving Jehovah (2Ch 29:4-6)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I be a source of encouragement to young ones whose parents do not serve Jehovah?’
