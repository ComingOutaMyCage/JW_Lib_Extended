TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Allow Jehovah to Use You




[Play the video Introduction to Ezra.]
Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus to release the Israelites (Ezr 1:1-3; w22.03 14 ¶1)
Jehovah stirred the spirit of his people to rebuild the temple (Ezr 1:5; w17.10 26 ¶2)





If you make yourself available, Jehovah can cause you to become whatever he needs to accomplish his will.
