<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>What is the audio Bible?</strong> The audio Bible is a recording of the revised <em>New World Translation.</em> It is being released gradually in as many languages as possible. One of the highlights of the audio Bible is that it uses a different voice for each Bible character. The words are read with proper emphasis and emotion to convey the Bible’s message with accuracy.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>How are some benefiting from the audio Bible?</strong> Many who listen regularly to the audio Bible love how it brings God’s Word to life. They feel that by hearing a different reader for each Bible character, they can visualize Bible events better and gain a clearer understanding of what is written. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:5-20:4:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Pr 4:5</a>) Many also find that listening to the audio Bible soothes them when they feel anxious.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:19-19:94:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 94:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Hearing God’s Word read aloud can have a powerful effect on our lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:34:19-14:34:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ch 34:19-21</a>) If the audio Bible is available in part or in full in a language that you understand, could you make listening to it a regular part of your spiritual routine?</p>
