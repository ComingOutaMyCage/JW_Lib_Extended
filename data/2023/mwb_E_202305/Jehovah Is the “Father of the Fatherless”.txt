LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Jehovah Is the “Father of the Fatherless”




Each year, many young ones choose to become Jehovah’s friend. (Ps 110:3) Jehovah cares deeply about each one of you. He understands the unique challenges you face and promises to help you to serve him. If you are being raised in a single-parent home, remember that Jehovah becomes the “father of the fatherless.” (Ps 68:5) With Jehovah’s training, you can succeed no matter what your situation is at home.​—1Pe 5:10.
