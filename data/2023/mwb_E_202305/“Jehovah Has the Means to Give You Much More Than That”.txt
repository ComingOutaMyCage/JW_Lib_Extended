TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“Jehovah Has the Means to Give You Much More Than That”




Amaziah hired mercenaries to fight against God’s enemies (2Ch 25:5, 6)
A man of God advised Amaziah to dismiss the mercenaries (2Ch 25:7, 8; it-1 1266 ¶6)
Jehovah could more than compensate Amaziah for any financial loss (2Ch 25:9, 10)





ASK YOURSELF: ‘What personal sacrifices could I make to serve Jehovah more fully? What blessings would I enjoy as a result?’​—Mal 3:10; w21.08 30 ¶16.
