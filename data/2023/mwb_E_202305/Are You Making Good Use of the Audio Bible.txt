Are You Making Good Use of the Audio Bible?




What is the audio Bible? The audio Bible is a recording of the revised New World Translation. It is being released gradually in as many languages as possible. One of the highlights of the audio Bible is that it uses a different voice for each Bible character. The words are read with proper emphasis and emotion to convey the Bible’s message with accuracy.
How are some benefiting from the audio Bible? Many who listen regularly to the audio Bible love how it brings God’s Word to life. They feel that by hearing a different reader for each Bible character, they can visualize Bible events better and gain a clearer understanding of what is written. (Pr 4:5) Many also find that listening to the audio Bible soothes them when they feel anxious.​—Ps 94:19.
Hearing God’s Word read aloud can have a powerful effect on our lives. (2Ch 34:19-21) If the audio Bible is available in part or in full in a language that you understand, could you make listening to it a regular part of your spiritual routine?
