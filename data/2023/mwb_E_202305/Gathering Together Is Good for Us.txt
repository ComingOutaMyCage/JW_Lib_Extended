Gathering Together Is Good for Us




Hezekiah organized a great Passover in Jerusalem (2Ch 30:1; it-1 1103 ¶2)
Many attended despite opposition (2Ch 30:10, 11, 13; it-1 1103 ¶3)
They experienced great joy and were motivated to serve Jehovah (2Ch 30:25–31:1; it-1 1103 ¶4-5)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘How have I benefited from attending meetings and conventions in person despite challenges?’
