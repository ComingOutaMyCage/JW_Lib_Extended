<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> In the Bible, we often read that Jehovah answered the prayers of his worshippers. Can you think of an example? What about King David? He faced many dangerous enemies throughout his life, and he often sought Jehovah’s help in prayer. On one occasion, he pleaded: “O Jehovah, hear my prayer; listen to my plea for help. In your <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>faithfulness and in your righteousness, answer me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:1-19:143:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 143:1</a>) Jehovah answered David’s prayers for deliverance.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> Did Jehovah’s worshippers in the past always have their prayers answered in the way that they expected? Give an example. (See also picture.)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Jehovah may not answer our prayers in the way that we expect. That was the case with the apostle Paul. He asked God to remove “a thorn in the flesh.” On three occasions, Paul prayed specifically about this difficult problem. Did Jehovah answer those prayers? Yes, but not in the way that Paul had hoped. Instead of removing the problem, Jehovah gave him the power that he needed to keep serving Him faithfully.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:7-47:12:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:7-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> At times, why may it seem that Jehovah is not answering our prayers?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> We too may at times receive an answer that differs from what we expect. We can be sure that Jehovah knows exactly how best to help us. He can even “do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:20-49:3:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eph. 3:20</a>) For that reason, his answer to our prayers could come at a time or in a way that we do not anticipate.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> Why may we need to change what we pray for? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We may need to change what we pray for as we discern Jehovah’s will more clearly. Consider the example of Martin Poetzinger. Soon after getting married, Brother Poetzinger was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. At first, he asked Jehovah to let him out of the concentration camp so that he could care for his wife and resume his preaching work. However, after two weeks, he saw no indication that Jehovah was opening the way for him to leave. So he began praying: “Jehovah, please show me what you want me to do.” He then began to think about what the other brothers in the camp were going through. Many of them were very worried about their own wife and children. Brother Poetzinger then prayed: “Jehovah, thank you for my new assignment. Help me to strengthen and encourage my <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>brothers.” He spent the next nine years in the camps doing exactly that!</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> What important factor should we keep in mind when praying?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> We must remember that Jehovah has a purpose, and he will fulfill it according to his established timetable. That purpose includes completely and permanently eliminating all problems that cause so much suffering today​—problems such as natural disasters, sickness, and death. Jehovah will accomplish his purpose by means of his Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Dan. 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:3, 4</a>) However, until that time, Jehovah is permitting Satan to rule the world.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 12:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:9</a>) If Jehovah were to solve mankind’s problems now, it could appear as if Satan’s rulership were having a measure of success. So while we must wait for Jehovah to fulfill certain promises, this does not mean that he leaves us without help. Let us consider some ways in which Jehovah comes to our aid.</p>

She says: “As our friendship developed, so did our feelings for each other. I knew I had to make a decision. I prayed long and hard about the matter. I needed Jehovah’s guidance, but I also knew that Jehovah wouldn’t make the decision for me.” She feels that Jehovah answered her prayers for wisdom. How? As she did research in our publications, she was able to find specific articles that helped her to work through her questions. She also took to heart the wise advice of her faithful mother. That advice helped Maria to analyze her feelings. In the end, she was able to make a wise decision.</p>

For most of his youth, Benjamin and his family lived in refugee camps in Africa. Benjamin says: “I prayed constantly to Jehovah, asking him to give me the power to do what is pleasing in his eyes. Jehovah answered my prayers by giving me peace of mind, the courage to continue preaching, and the publications to stay spiritually strong.” He goes on to explain: “Reading the experiences of fellow Witnesses and learning how Jehovah helped them to endure strengthened my determination to remain faithful.”</p>

As a result, they had financial problems. Soo Hing said that she felt like a rubber band that was stretched to the limit. She poured out her heart to Jehovah, asking him for help. The consulting doctor took an interest in their case. This led to their receiving government assistance and an affordable place to live.

A sister named Yoko felt that Jehovah was not answering her prayers, but then she began to keep a record of what she asked Jehovah for. After some time had gone by, she looked back through her notebook and realized that Jehovah had answered most of her prayers, even some that she had forgotten about.
