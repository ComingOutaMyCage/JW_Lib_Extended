<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>1-2.</strong> What important decision did Jews living in Babylon have to make? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:2-15:1:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 1:2-4</a>)</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE word had gone out! The Jews, who had been captives in Babylon for some 70 years, were free to return to their homeland, Israel. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:2-15:1:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Ezra 1:2-4</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Only Jehovah could have accomplished this. Why can we say that? Babylon would not normally release its captives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:4-23:14:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 14:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:17-23:14:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 17</a>) But Babylon had been overthrown, and the new ruler had told the Jews that they could leave the country. As a result, every Jew, especially family heads, faced a decision: to leave Babylon or to stay behind. That decision might not have been an easy one to make. Why not?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Old age prevented many from risking the hardships of the trip. And since most of the Jews had been born in Babylon, it was the only home they had ever known. To them, Israel was the land of their ancestors. Some Jews had apparently become very successful in Babylon, so they may have found it hard to leave their comfortable homes or their businesses and settle in an unfamiliar land.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What blessing awaited the remnant of faithful Jews who would return to Israel?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> In the minds of faithful Jews, the benefits of returning to Israel far outweighed any sacrifices they would make. The greatest blessing involved their worship. Although there were more than 50 pagan temples in Babylon, there was no temple of Jehovah in that city. There was no altar where the Israelites could offer up the sacrifices required by the Mosaic Law, and there was <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>no organized priesthood to offer those sacrifices. In addition, Jehovah’s people were greatly outnumbered by pagan men and women, who had no regard for Jehovah or his standards. So God-fearing Jews​—thousands of them—​were looking forward to returning to their homeland where they could restore pure worship.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> What help did Jehovah promise to give the Jews returning to Israel?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The difficult literal journey from Babylon to Israel could take about four months, but Jehovah promised that any obstacles that seemed to prevent their return would be cleared away. Isaiah wrote: “Clear up the way of Jehovah! Make a straight highway through the desert for our God. . . . The rough ground must become level, and the rugged ground a valley plain.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:3-23:40:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 40:3, 4</a>) Just picture this scene: a highway through the desert, a level valley plain. What a blessing that would be for travelers! It would be a lot easier for them to travel on a straight highway than to trudge up and down or around mountains, hills, or valleys. It would be faster too.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What name was given to the figurative highway between Babylon and Israel?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Today, many literal highways are identified by a name or a number. The figurative highway Isaiah wrote about also had a name. We read: “A highway will be there, yes, a way called the Way of Holiness. The unclean one will not travel on it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:8-23:35:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 35:8</a>) What did this promise mean for the Israelites back then? And what does it mean for us today?</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> “The Way of Holiness”​—what a beautiful name for a highway! Why was the road called holy? There would be no place in the restored nation of Israel for “the unclean one”​—any Jew who was determined to practice immorality, idolatry, or other gross sins. The returning Jews were to become “a holy people” to their God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:6-5:7:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 7:6</a>) That did not mean, though, that those who left Babylon did not need to make changes in order to please Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What changes did some of the Jews need to make? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> As noted earlier, most of the Jews were born in Babylon, and many had apparently become accustomed to some of the thinking and standards of the Babylonians. Decades after the first Jews returned to Israel, Ezra learned that some Jews had formed marriage alliances with pagan women. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:15-2:34:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 34:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:9:1-15:9:2" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ezra 9:1, 2</a>) Still later, Governor Nehemiah was astonished to find out that children born in Israel had not even learned the language of the Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:23-16:13:24" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Neh. 13:23, 24</a>) How could those young ones learn to love and worship Jehovah if they could not understand Hebrew​—the main language in which God’s Word was written? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:3-15:10:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezra 10:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:44-15:10:44" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 44</a>) So those Jews had significant changes to make, but it would be much easier for them to make those changes in Israel, where pure worship was gradually being restored.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:8-16:8:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Neh. 8:8, 9</a>.</p>

For many centuries leading up to 1919, Jehovah used God-fearing men to help clear the way out of Babylon the Great. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:3-23:40:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:3</a>.) They did necessary preparatory work​—spiritual roadwork—​to make it possible later for righthearted people to leave Babylon the Great and enter the spiritual paradise, where pure worship of Jehovah had been restored. What did this “roadwork” involve? Consider some of the preparatory work that was done.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>12-13.</strong> Give an example of how sincere students of the Bible in the 19th century began to expose false religious teachings.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Bible study aids.</em></strong> Careful students of the Bible learned a great deal from what they read in God’s Word. And, much to the displeasure of many clergymen, they rarely kept their discoveries to themselves. In the 19th century, for example, a number of sincere men began to publish tracts that exposed the false religious teachings of the churches.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> About 1835 a God-fearing man named Henry Grew published a tract discussing the condition of the dead. In it, he proved from the Scriptures that immortality is a gift from God, not a condition we are all born with, as most of the churches taught. In 1837 a minister <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>named George Storrs found a copy of that tract while riding a train. He read it and was convinced that he had discovered a vital truth. He decided to share what he had learned. In 1842 he gave a series of lectures on the intriguing theme “An Inquiry​—Are the Wicked Immortal?” The writings of George Storrs had a positive influence on a young man named Charles Taze Russell.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong> In what ways did Brother Russell and his associates benefit from the spiritual roadwork of the past? (See also picture.)</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> In what ways did Brother Russell and his associates benefit from the spiritual roadwork that had been done in the past? In their studies, they were able to consult lexicons, concordances, and various translations of the Bible, all of which had been prepared before their time. They also benefited from the Bible research of such men as Henry Grew, George Storrs, and others. Brother Russell and his associates contributed to the spiritual roadwork themselves by producing an abundance of books and tracts that considered Bible topics.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>15.</strong> What important developments took place in 1919?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> In 1919, Babylon the Great lost its hold over God’s people. That year, a “faithful and discreet slave” came on the scene, just in time to welcome honesthearted ones to the newly opened “Way of Holiness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>) Thanks in part to the faithful “road workers” of the past, those setting foot on that highway could increase their knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18</a>) They could also bring their life into harmony with Jehovah’s requirements. Jehovah has not expected his people to make the necessary changes all at once. Rather, he has refined his people over time. (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2023404/51-63">Jehovah Gradually Refines His People</a>.”) How happy we will all be when <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>we are able to please our God in everything we do!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:10-51:1:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Col. 1:10</a>.</p>
