<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> An important way to help children draw close to Jehovah is by studying the Bible with them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:14-17</a>) Yet, the Bible reveals another way that young ones can learn about Jehovah. In the book of Proverbs, a father evidently reminds his son never to lose sight of Jehovah’s qualities, which are revealed in <strong><em>creation.</em></strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:19-20:3:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 3:19-21</a>) We will consider some ways that parents can use creation to help their children learn about Jehovah’s personality.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What help should parents give their children?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The Bible says that God’s “invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>) Parents, you likely enjoy spending time outdoors with your young ones. Use that time to help your children see the connection between “the things made” and Jehovah’s marvelous qualities. In this regard, let us see what parents can learn from Jesus’ example.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> How did Jesus use creation to teach his disciples? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:24-42:12:24" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 12:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:27-42:12:30" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 27-30</a>)</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Note how Jesus used creation to teach. On one occasion, he asked his disciples to observe the ravens and the lilies. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:24-42:12:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 12:24,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:27-42:12:30" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <strong>27-30</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jesus could have mentioned any animal or plant, but he chose a bird and a flower that his disciples knew well. The disciples might have seen ravens flying overhead and flowers blooming in the field. Can you imagine Jesus gesturing toward these things as he spoke? And what did he do after mentioning these examples? He taught his disciples a powerful lesson about their heavenly Father’s generosity and kindness: Jehovah will feed and clothe his faithful servants as he does the ravens and the flowers in the field.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What examples found in creation can parents use to teach their child about Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Parents, will you imitate Jesus’ way of teaching? You might tell your child about an aspect of creation that you personally appreciate, such as your favorite animal or plant. As you do, be sure to explain what that example reveals about Jehovah. You might then ask your child about his favorite animal or plant. If you use an aspect of creation that already appeals to him, he will probably pay even closer attention when you talk about Jehovah’s qualities.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What can we learn from the example set by Christopher’s mother?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Do parents have to spend a lot of time researching a particular animal or plant before discussing what that creative work reveals about Jehovah? Not necessarily. Jesus did not give a long explanation regarding the feeding habits of ravens or the cellular composition of lilies. Granted, your child may occasionally enjoy a deeper discussion about nature, but sometimes a simple observation or question is enough to make the point. Note what a brother named Christopher remembers from his childhood: “My mom would make simple comments to help us appreciate the creation around us. For example, when we were near mountains, she might say: ‘Look at how huge and beautiful those mountains are! Isn’t Jehovah amazing?’ Or when we were near the ocean, she might say: ‘Look at the power of those waves! Isn’t God powerful?’” Christopher says: “Those simple, thought-provoking comments had a big impact on us.”</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> How can you train your children to reflect on creation?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> As your children grow older, you can train them to give more thought to creation and to draw conclusions about Jehovah’s personality. You can highlight one of God’s creative works and ask your children, “What does this teach you about Jehovah?” You may be surprised to hear what they have to say.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:16-40:21:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 21:16</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> What opportunity did Israelite parents have as they traveled “on the road”?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Israelite parents were urged to teach their children the words of Jehovah’s commandments when walking “on the road.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:19-5:11:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 11:19</a>) Roads ran through the countryside of Israel. A variety of <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>animals, birds, and flowers could be seen. As Israelite families traveled on roads, the parents had the opportunity to spark their children’s interest in Jehovah’s creation. You parents likely have similar opportunities to use creation to teach your children. Consider how some parents have done that.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What can you learn from Punitha and Katya?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> A mother named Punitha, who lives in a large city in India, says: “When we visit family in the countryside, we view it as an opportunity to help our children learn about Jehovah’s marvelous creation. I feel that my children understand creation better when they are away from the crowded streets and the city traffic.” Parents, your children will likely never forget the time they spend with you in a beautiful setting. Katya, a sister from Moldova, says: “My most vivid childhood memories are those spent with my parents in the countryside. I am grateful to them for teaching me from a young age to stop and observe what Jehovah has made and to see him through his creation.”</p>

Amol, who also lives in India, says: “Where I live, parents have to work long hours, and a trip to the countryside can be expensive. However, a small park or rooftop terrace can serve as a place to observe creation and talk about Jehovah’s qualities.” When you look carefully, you will likely also discover near your home many features of creation that you can show your children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24</a>) You <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>will probably find birds, insects, plants, and more. Karina, from Germany, says: “My mom loves flowers, so when I was a young girl, she would point out pretty flowers whenever we took a walk together.” Parents, you can also use the many videos and publications about creation that our organization has produced to teach your children. Yes, whatever your circumstances, you can help your children to observe what God has made. Now let us consider some of Jehovah’s qualities that you could point out to your children.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:36-18:38:37" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 38:36, 37</a>) You could also highlight the amazing design of the human body. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 139:14</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Consider how a father named Vladimir did so. He says: “One day, our son fell off his bike and hurt himself. After a few days, the wound healed. My wife and I explained that Jehovah created our cells with the ability to repair themselves. We pointed out that we don’t see anything like this in the things that humans make. For example, a car does <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>not repair itself after an accident.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Jehovah invites us to lift up our eyes to the heavens and think about how his amazing <strong><em>power</em></strong> keeps the universe in place. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 40:26</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> You can encourage your children to look up at the sky and reflect. Note what Tingting, a sister from Taiwan, recalls from her childhood: “Once, my mom took me camping, and we looked at the night sky undisturbed by city lights. That was at a period when I was worried about peer pressure and wondered if I would be able to keep serving Jehovah faithfully. My mom encouraged me to think about the power Jehovah used to create all those stars and to remember that He can certainly use that power to help me face any test. After observing creation on that trip, I was moved to get to know Jehovah better, and I strengthened my resolve to serve him.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:40:20-18:40:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 40:20</a>) Have your children ever laughed as they watched an animal play?

Why? One reason is that there are fewer distractions for children and for parents. A father in Taiwan named Masahiko mentions another reason: “When we spend time outdoors with our children​—hiking in the mountains or walking along the beach—​they usually feel more relaxed. We thus find it easier to draw them out and learn what is on their mind.” Katya, quoted earlier, says: “After school, my mother would take me to a beautiful park.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s creation can also provide families with a means to relax and have fun, thus strengthening family ties.

Through his handiwork, Jehovah has given us wonderful settings to enjoy wholesome activities. Many families like being together at a nature reserve, in the countryside, in the mountains, or at the beach. Some children love to run and play in a park, to observe animals, or to swim in a river, a lake, or the sea. What excellent opportunities we have for recreation when we are out in the open, surrounded by what Jehovah has made!</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>17.</strong> Why should parents help their children to enjoy God’s creation?</p>
