<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> How did the Ethiopian show that he was determined to keep learning?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The Ethiopian man “had gone to Jerusalem to worship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:27-44:8:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 8:27</a>) He must therefore have been a Jewish proselyte; he had converted to Judaism. No doubt he had learned about Jehovah from the sacred writings of <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>the Hebrew Scriptures. Still, he was eager to learn more. In fact, when Philip met that official on the road, what did Philip find the man doing? Poring over a scroll of the prophet Isaiah’s writings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:28-44:8:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 8:28</a>) That was solid spiritual food. The court official was not content simply to learn a few basics; he wanted to keep learning.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What did the Ethiopian do about what he learned?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The man was a high official under Queen Candace of Ethiopia; he “was in charge of all her treasure.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:27-44:8:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 8:27</a>) So he must have been a busy man with many responsibilities. Yet, he took time to worship Jehovah. He was not content with <strong><em>learning</em></strong> the truth; he <strong><em>acted</em></strong> on what he learned. He therefore traveled all the way from Ethiopia in order to worship Jehovah at the temple in Jerusalem. That journey must have involved a great deal of time and expense, but the man spared no effort where Jehovah’s worship was concerned.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>6-7.</strong> How did the Ethiopian’s love for Jehovah continue to grow?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> The Ethiopian learned from Philip some vital new truths, including the identity of the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:34-44:8:35" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 8:34, 35</a>) This court official was surely touched to learn what Jesus had done for him. How would he respond? He could have remained as he was, a respected Jewish proselyte. Instead, his love for Jehovah and His Son grew. He was moved to make the life-changing decision to get baptized as a follower of Jesus Christ. Seeing that the man was ready, Philip baptized him.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> If you follow that Ethiopian’s example, you can get ready for baptism.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="40-1" class="b">John 17:3</a> apply to you?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>John 17:3</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Did these words of Jesus help you decide to study the Bible? That is true for many of us. But do the same words also tell us to keep on learning? Yes. We will never stop “coming to know . . . the only true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11</a>) For all eternity, we will keep <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>learning. The more we learn, the closer we will draw to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:28-19:73:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 73:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What do we need to do after gaining basic knowledge of the truth?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Understandably, learning about Jehovah starts with the basics. In his letter to the Hebrews, the apostle Paul referred to basic teachings as “the elementary things.” He was not belittling “the primary doctrine”; he was comparing it to the milk that nourishes a baby. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:1-58:6:1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6:1</a>) But he also urged all Christians to keep moving beyond those basic teachings and to learn the deeper truths of God’s Word. Have you developed a hunger for the deeper teachings of the Bible? Are you willing to keep growing, to keep learning about Jehovah and his purposes?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> Why might some find it a challenge to study?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> For many of us, though, it is a challenge to study. What about you? At school, did you learn to read and study effectively? Did you find study to be enjoyable and rewarding? Or did you conclude that you are not good at learning from books? If so, you are not alone. However, Jehovah can help you. He is perfect and is the best Teacher there is.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> How does Jehovah prove to be the “Grand Instructor”?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Jehovah calls himself “your Grand Instructor.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:20-23:30:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 30:20, 21</a>) He is a patient, kind, understanding Teacher. He looks for the good in his students. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:3-19:130:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 130:3</a>) And he never expects more of us than we can do. Remember, he designed your brain, a wonderful gift. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>) We have a natural hunger to learn. Our Creator wants us to keep learning forever​—and to enjoy it. So it is wise to “form a longing” for Bible truths now. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:2-60:2:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:2</a>) Set goals that you can reach, and stick to a schedule of Bible reading and study. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>) With Jehovah’s blessing, you will come to enjoy reading and learning about him more and more.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> Why should we focus on Jesus in our personal study?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Regularly spend time meditating on Jesus’ life and ministry. Our following Jesus’ steps closely is the key to serving Jehovah, especially in these difficult times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21</a>) Jesus spoke frankly about the challenges his followers would face. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:27-42:14:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 14:27, 28</a>) Yet, he was confident that his true followers could succeed, as he did. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:33-43:16:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 16:33</a>) Study details of Jesus’ life course, and set goals to imitate him in your daily life.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong> What should you keep asking Jehovah for, and why?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Knowledge alone is never enough. Its primary value is in how it helps you to learn more about Jehovah and to develop such qualities as love for him and faith in him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:1-46:8:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:1-3</a>) As you continue learning, keep asking Jehovah to help you gain more faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:5-42:17:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 17:5</a>) He generously answers such prayers. Genuine faith based on accurate knowledge of our God will help you take further action.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:26-59:2:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jas. 2:26</a>.</p>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong> How did the apostle Peter highlight the importance of acting on what we learn? (See also picture.)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> The apostle Peter highlighted how important it is for followers of Christ to keep acting on what they learn. He referred <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>to the Bible account about Noah. Jehovah told Noah that by means of a flood, He was going to bring destruction on the wicked people of that day. Simply knowing that a flood was coming was not enough to save Noah and his family. Note that Peter referred to the time period before the Flood <strong><em>“while the ark was being constructed.”</em></strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:20-60:3:20" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:20</a>) Yes, Noah and his family acted on what they learned from God by building an ark, a huge vessel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 11:7</a>) Peter then compared what Noah did to baptism, writing: “Baptism, which corresponds to this, is also now saving you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:21</a>) In a sense, we might compare the work you are doing now to prepare for baptism to the work Noah and his family did for years to build the ark. What work do you need to do in order to get ready for baptism?</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>15.</strong> What does genuine repentance involve?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> One of the first things we must do is sincerely repent of our sins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:37-44:2:38" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 2:37, 38</a>) Genuine repentance leads to genuine change. Have you put away any practices that displease Jehovah, such as living immorally, using tobacco, or using foul or abusive language? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 7:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:29-49:4:29" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Eph. 4:29</a>) If you have not yet done so, keep trying to make changes. Talk to the person studying the Bible with you, or ask the congregation elders for help and guidance. If you are young and are living at home, keep asking your parents for help to break any bad habits that might prevent you from getting baptized.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>16.</strong> What does a good spiritual routine include?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> It is also important to follow a good spiritual routine. That would include attending Christian meetings and participating in them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) And once you qualify to engage in the Christian ministry, make that part of your routine as well. The more you share in that lifesaving work, the more you will enjoy it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:5-55:4:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:5</a>) If you are young and living at home, ask yourself: ‘Do my parents need to remind me to attend <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>the meetings or to join in the ministry? Or do I take the initiative myself?’ By taking such actions on your own, you express your faith and show your love and gratitude to Jehovah God. These are “deeds of godly devotion,” gifts you offer to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:11" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:15</a>) All gifts that we offer freely and without being pressured are pleasing to our God. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>.) We take such actions because we delight in offering our best to Jehovah.</p>
