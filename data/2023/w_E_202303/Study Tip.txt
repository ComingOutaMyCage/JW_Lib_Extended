Using “What’s New” Effectively

The “What’s New” section in JW Library® and on jw.org shows the most recently published material. How can you use this section to stay up-to-date?



JW Library

  Individual articles are released by updating the article series to which they belong. So when an article series appears in the “What’s New” section, you can download the latest version of that series. Then you can read the new article that appears at the top of the list, which is sorted by date.

  Longer publications, such as magazines, may take more than one session to read entirely. To help keep track of what you have not yet read completely, try adding the magazine to your Favorites list until you are finished.





JW.ORG

Some content, including news stories and announcements, appears only on the jw.org website, not in JW Library. Remember to check the “What’s New” page on the website regularly for the latest articles.
