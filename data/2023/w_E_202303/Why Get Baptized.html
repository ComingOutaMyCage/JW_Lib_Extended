<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>HAVE you ever watched a group of baptism candidates? You hear the conviction in their voices as they answer the two questions before they get baptized. You see family members and friends beaming. When the candidates come up out of the water, you hear the applause and see the joy that radiates on their faces. On average, thousands each week take that step, becoming dedicated, baptized Witnesses of Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> What about you? If you are thinking about getting baptized, you are a bright spot in this wicked world as someone who is “seeking Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:14:1-19:14:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1, 2</a>) This article is addressed to you whether you are young or old. But those of us who are already baptized also want to strengthen our determination to serve Jehovah forever. So let us consider together three of the many reasons for serving Jehovah.</p>

Satan has been spreading lies about our God since the rebellion in Eden. He portrayed Jehovah as a selfish and dishonest Ruler who withholds good from humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:4-1:3:5" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4, 5</a>) Satan’s lies about Jehovah have continued to poison the minds and hearts of people.

I want Jehovah as my Sovereign, and I want to do what he says is right.” How do you take such a stand? Approach Jehovah in prayer and dedicate yourself to him and then make that dedication public by getting baptized. Love for what is true and right is a powerful motive for choosing to get baptized.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Why do you love Jesus Christ? Note some compelling reasons found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:45:4-19:45:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 45:4</strong></a><strong>. (Read.)</strong> Jesus stands for truth, humility, and righteousness. If you love truth and righteousness, it is <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>understandable that you also love Jesus Christ. Think of how Jesus courageously defended what is true and right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) How, though, does Jesus promote humility?</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What do you find appealing about Jesus’ humility?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Jesus promotes humility by his example. For instance, he directs all glory to his Father, never to himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:17-41:10:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mark 10:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:19-43:5:19" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> John 5:19</a>) How do you feel about seeing such humility? Does it not move you to love God’s Son and to follow him? Surely it does. Why is Jesus humble? Because he loves and imitates his Father, who is humble. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:35-19:18:35" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 18:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:3-58:1:3" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:3</a>) Are you not drawn to Jesus, who perfectly reflects Jehovah’s qualities?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> Why do we love Jesus as our King?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> We love Jesus as our King because he is the ideal Ruler. Jehovah himself trained his Son and appointed him to rule. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:4-23:50:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 50:4, 5</a>) Think, too, of the self-sacrificing love Jesus has shown. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:1-43:13:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 13:1</a>) As your King, Jesus fully deserves your love. He explained that those who truly love him​—those whom he calls his friends—​show their love by obeying his commands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:15-43:14:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 14:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:14-43:15:15" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 15:14, 15</a>) What an honor it is to be a friend of Jehovah’s Son!</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> How is the baptism of Christians similar to that of Christ?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> One of Jesus’ commands is that his followers get baptized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) He set the example. In some ways, his baptism is different from that of his followers. (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2023320/58-64">The Baptism of Jesus and the Baptism of His Followers​—How They Differ</a>.”) But in other ways, it is similar. In getting baptized, Jesus presented himself to do his Father’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:7-58:10:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7</a>) Similarly, Christ’s followers get baptized as a public symbol that they have dedicated themselves to Jehovah God. Their life is now focused on doing his will, not their own. So they are following their Master’s example.</p>

Why can we say that? Consider the bond that exists between Jehovah and his Son.

Only you can answer. But it might help if you ask yourself, ‘Why wait?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:36-44:8:36" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Acts 8:36</a>) Remember the three reasons that we have considered. First, you love truth and righteousness. Ask yourself, ‘Do I want to see the day when everyone will speak the truth and do what is right?’ Second, you love Jesus Christ. Ask yourself, ‘Do I want God’s Son as my King, and do I want to follow his example?’ Third, above all, you love Jehovah. Ask yourself, ‘Do I want to make Jehovah’s heart rejoice by serving him as my God?’ If your answers to those questions are yes, then why <em>not</em> get baptized? Why wait?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:33-44:16:33" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 16:33</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> If you are hesitant about getting baptized, consider an illustration that Jesus used. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:34-43:4:34" data-bid="39-1" class="b"><strong>John 4:34</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Note that Jesus compared doing his Father’s will to food. Why? Food is good for us. Jesus knew that everything that Jehovah asks us to do is good for us. Jehovah does not want us to do anything that would result in our harm. Does Jehovah’s will for you include getting baptized? Yes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:38-44:2:38" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Acts 2:38</a>) Then you can be confident that obeying the command to get baptized will benefit you. If you would not hesitate to enjoy the best meal ever, why hesitate to get baptized?</p>

So it does take time, careful thought, and diligent effort to get ready. But if you have a sincere desire to take that step, what can you do now to prepare yourself?
