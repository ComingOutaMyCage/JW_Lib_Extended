<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IN THE late 1970’s, a 60-story skyscraper gradually rose above the skyline of Tokyo, Japan. Observers wondered how it would be able to withstand the frequent earthquakes in that city. The secret? Engineers designed the building to be rigid yet flexible enough to absorb seismic shocks. Christians are like that skyscraper. In what way?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> A Christian must maintain a balance between steadfastness and flexibility. He needs to be strong and immovable when it comes to upholding Jehovah’s laws and standards. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:58</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> He is “ready to obey” and does not compromise. On the other hand, he needs to be “reasonable,” or flexible, when the situation allows for it or even requires it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 3:17</a>) A Christian who has learned to have this balanced view will avoid the extremes of being either excessively rigid or overly permissive. In this article, we will consider how we can be immovable. We will also identify five ways that Satan tries to weaken our resolve and learn how we can resist his efforts.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> As the Supreme Lawgiver, Jehovah has consistently conveyed clear laws to his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:22-23:33:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 33:22</a>) For example, the first-century governing body identified three <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>ways in which Christians must remain firm: (1) by rejecting idolatry, worshipping only Jehovah, (2) by respecting the sanctity of blood, and (3) by adhering to the Bible’s high moral standards. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 15:28, 29</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> How can Christians today maintain a firm stand in these three specific ways?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8-10</a>) Therefore, we do not worship religious idols. We also do not idolize humans​—whether they are religious leaders, political rulers, or stars in the world of sports and entertainment—​treating them like gods. We take our stand on Jehovah’s side and worship only the one who “created all things.”​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 4:11</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

Because Jehovah says that blood represents life, a precious gift from him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:14-3:17:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Lev. 17:14</a>) When Jehovah first allowed humans to eat the flesh of animals, he directed them not to eat the blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 9:4</a>) He repeated this command when he gave the Mosaic Law to Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:10-3:17:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Lev. 17:10</a>) And he directed the first-century governing body to decree that all Christians “keep abstaining . . . from blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>) We steadfastly obey this command when we make medical decisions.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What efforts do we make to live by Jehovah’s high moral standards?</p>

We avoid looking at or doing anything that could lead to sexual immorality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Col. 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:1-18:31:1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Job 31:1</a>) When we face temptation, we immediately reject any thought or action that could damage our friendship with God.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What should we resolve to do, and why?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Jehovah expects us to be “obedient from the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:17-45:6:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 6:17</a>) His guidance is always in our best interests, and his laws are nonnegotiable.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Persecution.</em></strong> The Devil uses physical and emotional attacks in an effort to weaken our resolve. His aim is “to devour” us, to destroy our relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:8</a>) <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>Christians in the first century were threatened, beaten, and killed because of their determination to stand firm. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:27-44:5:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 5:27, 28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:40-44:5:40" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:54-44:7:60" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 7:54-60</a>) Satan continues to use persecution today. This is evident in the brutal treatment of our brothers and sisters in Russia and other countries and in the personal attacks by opposers.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> Illustrate the need to beware of subtle pressures.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Subtle pressures.</em></strong> Satan uses “crafty acts” in addition to blatant frontal attacks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:11" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 6:11</a>) Take the example of a brother named Bob, who was hospitalized for major surgery. He informed the doctors that under no circumstances would he accept a blood transfusion. The surgeon agreed to respect his decision. However, on the night before the surgery, the anesthesiologist paid Bob a visit after his family had gone home. He told Bob that blood would likely not be given but that they would have it on hand just in case it was needed. Perhaps the doctor thought that Bob would change his mind without his family around. But Bob remained steadfast, stating that he was not to be given blood under any circumstances.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> Why is human reasoning a snare? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:19-46:3:20" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:19, 20</a>)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Human reasoning.</em></strong> If we look at matters from a human standpoint, we may leave out Jehovah and his standards. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:19-46:3:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 3:19, 20</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> “The wisdom of this world” often appeals to fleshly desires. A few Christians in Pergamum and Thyatira adopted the idolatrous and immoral views common in those cities. Jesus sent strong counsel to both congregations for their toleration of sexual immorality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:14-66:2:14" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 2:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:20-66:2:20" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 20</a>) Today, we face pressure to adopt wrong viewpoints. Family members and acquaintances may appeal to our emotions and encourage us to compromise. For example, they may claim that giving in to our desires does not matter and that the Bible’s moral standards are outdated.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> As we stand firm, what must we avoid?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> At times, we might reason that the direction Jehovah gives us is not sufficient. We might even be tempted to “go beyond the things that are written.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:6-46:4:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:6</a>) The religious leaders in Jesus’ day were guilty of this sin. By adding man-made rules to the Law, they imposed a heavy burden on the common people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:4-40:23:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 23:4</a>) Jehovah gives us clear direction through his Word and through his organization.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5-7</a>) Therefore, we do not go beyond what is written in the Bible or make rules for fellow believers about personal matters.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> How does Satan promote “empty deception”?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Deceptions.</em></strong> Satan employs “empty deception” and “the elementary things of the world” to mislead and divide people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:8-51:2:8" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Col. 2:8</a>) In the first century, these included philosophies based on human reasonings, unscriptural Jewish teachings, and the teaching that Christians must observe the Mosaic Law. These were deceptions because they took people’s attention away from the true Source of wisdom, Jehovah. Today, Satan uses the media and social networks <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>to spread conspiracy theories and false news reports promoted by political leaders. We saw much of this during the COVID-19 pandemic.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Jehovah’s Witnesses who listened to the guidance given by our organization avoided the undue anxieties experienced by those who listened to misleading information.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong> Why must we be on guard against distractions?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Distractions.</em></strong> We must not lose sight of “the more important things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:9-50:1:10" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Phil. 1:9, 10</a>) Distractions can take an excessive amount of our time and attention away from more beneficial pursuits. Ordinary features of life​—such as eating, drinking, recreation, and secular work—​could become distractions if we allow them to become the focus of our life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:35" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Luke 21:34, 35</a>) In addition, every day we are bombarded with news reports about social disputes and political issues. We cannot afford to be distracted by these debates. Otherwise, we may begin to take sides in our mind and heart. Satan uses all these methods mentioned above with the goal of weakening our determination to do what is right. Let us consider how we can resist his efforts and remain firm.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:14-49:4:14" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Eph. 4:14</a>) Instead, let us stand firm, steadfast in our devotion to Jehovah and immovable in our obedience to his commands.
