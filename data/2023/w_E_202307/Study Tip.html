<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We all have a limited amount of time for personal study. How can we make the best use of it? First, take your time. You will actually benefit more by studying a little material carefully than by skimming through a lot of material.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Then, set some priorities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15, 16</a>) Consider these suggestions:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Read the Bible every day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:2-19:1:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2</a>) Our weekly Bible reading schedule for the midweek meeting is an excellent starting point.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Prepare for the <em>Watchtower</em> Study and the midweek meeting. Be ready to comment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:22-19:22:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 22:22</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  As you have the time, keep up-to-date with other spiritual food, such as our public magazines, videos, and material published on jw.org.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  Do a study project. You could do research on a challenge you are facing, a question you have, or a Bible topic you would like to understand better. To get ideas, review the “<a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=1011238&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E">Bible Study Activities</a>” section on jw.org.</p>
