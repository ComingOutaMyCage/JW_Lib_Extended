<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>PREPARATION saves lives. For example, when a disaster strikes, people who have prepared for it are more likely to survive and to be able to help others. A humanitarian organization in Europe put it this way: “Good preparation can make all the difference.”</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong> Why should we prepare for the great tribulation? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:44-40:24:44" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 24:44</a>)</p>

About 2,000 years ago, Jesus warned his followers to get ready for that day. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:44-40:24:44" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 24:44</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> If we are prepared, it will be easier for us to go through that difficult time and to help others to do the same.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:36-42:21:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:36</a>.</p>

How will we respond if we are asked to preach a hard-hitting judgment message and unbelievers oppose us? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:21-66:16:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 16:21</a>) We will need <strong><em>endurance</em></strong> to obey Jehovah, trusting that he will protect us. What will we do if our brothers lose some or all of their material things? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:17-35:3:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hab. 3:17, 18</a>) We will need <strong><em>compassion</em></strong> to move us to provide them with relief. How will we react if, as a result of the attack by a coalition of nations, we have to live in close quarters with our brothers and sisters for a while? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:10-26:38:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:10-12</a>) We will need strong <strong><em>love</em></strong> for them to help us get through that difficult time.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> How does the Bible indicate that we must keep cultivating endurance, compassion, and love?</p>

But we urge you, brothers, to go on doing so in fuller measure.” All these verses were addressed to disciples who had already shown endurance, compassion, and love. Yet, they had to continue developing these qualities. We must do the same. To help us, we will consider how the early Christians demonstrated each quality. Then we will see how we can imitate those disciples and, as a result, prove ourselves ready for the great tribulation.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> How did the early Christians endure their trials?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The early Christians needed to endure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:36-58:10:36" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 10:36</a>) Besides dealing with problems common to all people, they faced additional trials. Many of them were persecuted, not only by Jewish religious leaders and the Roman authorities but also by their own families. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:21-40:10:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 10:21</a>) And within the congregation, sometimes they had to fight the influence of the apostates and their divisive teachings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 20:29, 30</a>) Yet, those Christians endured. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:3-66:2:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 2:3</a>) How? They reflected on Scriptural examples of endurance, such as Job. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:10-59:5:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jas. 5:10, 11</a>) They prayed for strength. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:29-44:4:31" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 4:29-31</a>) And they focused on the good results of their endurance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:41-44:5:41" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 5:41</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What do you learn from what Merita did to endure opposition?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> We too can endure if we regularly study examples of endurance in God’s Word and in our publications and meditate on them. By doing that, Merita, a sister in Albania, was able to face violent family opposition. She says: “I was deeply moved when I studied the Bible account of Job. He suffered so much​—not knowing who was causing his tests—​and yet he said: ‘Until I die, I will not renounce my integrity!’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:5-18:27:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) I thought about how my tests paled in comparison with Job’s. Unlike him, I knew who was behind these trials.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> Even if we are not currently facing a severe trial, what should we learn to do now?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We can also build up our endurance by frequently and earnestly sharing our concerns with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:6" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:17-52:5:17" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 5:17</a>) Perhaps you are not facing a severe trial right now. Even so, do you seek Jehovah’s guidance whenever you feel upset, confused, or overwhelmed? If you regularly turn to our God for help with your day-to-day challenges now, you will not hesitate to do so when you face bigger challenges in the future. You will then be confident that he knows precisely when and how to act in your behalf.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:1-19:27:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 27:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:3-19:27:3" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 3</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:3-45:5:3" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 5:3</a>) Why can we say that? Many brothers have found that each test of faith that they endured helped them withstand the next challenge. Endurance <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>refined them, strengthening their faith that Jehovah is ready and willing to help. Faith, in turn, helped them endure the next trial. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:2-4</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Mira, a pioneer in Albania, has found that her past endurance has helped her to continue enduring. She admits that sometimes she feels that she is the only one who has so many problems. But then she recalls how much Jehovah has done in the last 20 years to support her, and she tells herself: ‘Stay faithful. Don’t let all those years and all those battles that you have won with Jehovah’s help go to waste.’ You too can reflect on how Jehovah has already helped you to endure. Be confident that he notices each time you endure a trial and that he will reward you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:10-40:5:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 5:10-12</a>) Then when the great tribulation begins, you will have learned how to endure and you will be determined to continue to endure.</p>

Those who serve with relief committees deserve our warm commendation. Motivated by compassion for their brothers and sisters, they have distributed material relief, provided spiritual care and, in some cases, repaired or rebuilt homes and places of worship.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:1-47:8:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 8:1-4</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> When we show compassion after a disaster, others notice the sacrifices that we make. For instance, in 2019, Hurricane Dorian destroyed a Kingdom Hall in the Bahamas. While our brothers were rebuilding the hall, they asked a non-Witness contractor to provide a quote for some needed work. He told them: “I’d like to donate . . . the equipment, the labor and the materials. . . . I just want to do this for your organization. I’m moved by how [you] feel about your friends.” Most people in the world do not know <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>Jehovah. But many of them <strong><em>do</em></strong> observe Jehovah’s Witnesses. What a privilege to know that our acts of compassion can draw people to the One who is “rich in mercy”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:4-49:2:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Eph. 2:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Love was the identifying mark of the early Christians. But did they find it easy to show love? Consider the diversity of the congregation in Rome. Among them were not only Jews, who were raised to obey the Mosaic Law, but also Gentiles, whose background was totally different. Some Christians were likely slaves while others were freemen​—perhaps some were even slave owners. How could those Christians overcome such differences and strengthen their love? The apostle Paul urged them to “welcome one another.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:7-45:15:7" data-bid="31-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 15:7</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> What did he mean? The word translated “welcome” means to receive someone kindly or hospitably, such as into one’s home or circle of friends. For example, Paul told Philemon how to welcome the runaway slave Onesimus: “Receive him kindly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:17-57:1:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Philem. 17</a>) And Priscilla and Aquila welcomed Apollos, who knew less about Christianity than they did, by taking “him into their company.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:26-44:18:26" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 18:26</a>) Rather than allow their diversity to divide them, those Christians overcame their differences and welcomed one another.</p>

Shortly after they moved to a new missionary assignment in West Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. As new arrivals, they could not meet in person with their congregation. How could the couple show their love? They used videoconferencing to get in touch with the brothers and sisters there and tell them how much they wanted to get to know them better. The families were touched and responded with frequent calls and messages. Why did the couple reach out? Anna says, “The acts of love shown to me and my family in good times and in bad times are embedded in my heart and mind and have motivated me to show love.”</p>

A sister named Vanessa, who serves in New Zealand, used to find it difficult to get along with some in her congregation.

She says: “Since my husband became a circuit overseer, we are in the company of many more brothers and sisters who have different personalities, and I find it easier to get along with them. I now love the variety. Jehovah obviously loves it too because he has drawn us into such a diverse group.” When we learn to see others as Jehovah sees them, we prove that we love them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:24-47:8:24" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:24</a>.</p>
