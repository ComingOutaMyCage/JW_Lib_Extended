LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
They Work Hard to Serve Us




Circuit overseers and their wives show self-sacrificing love for those whom they serve. Like all of us, they have personal needs and sometimes experience tiredness, discouragement, and anxiety. (Jas 5:17) Nonetheless, each week they focus on encouraging the brothers and sisters in the congregation they are visiting. Circuit overseers are truly “worthy of double honor.”​—1Ti 5:17.
When the apostle Paul planned his visit to Rome in order to “impart some spiritual gift” to the congregation there, he looked forward to “an interchange of encouragement.” (Ro 1:11, 12) Have you thought about how you can encourage your circuit overseer and his wife, if married?
