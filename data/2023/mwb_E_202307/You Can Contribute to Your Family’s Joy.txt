LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
You Can Contribute to Your Family’s Joy




Jehovah wants families to be happy. (Ps 127:3-5; Ec 9:9; 11:9) However, our joy can be disrupted because of stress from this world and the mistakes of family members. What can each member of the family do to contribute to joy?
A husband assigns his wife honor. (1Pe 3:7) He spends time with her. He is realistic in what he expects of her and demonstrates his appreciation for what she does for him and the family. (Col 3:15) He expresses his love and praises her.​—Pr 31:28, 31.
A wife looks for ways to support her husband. (Pr 31:12) She is in subjection to him and cooperates with him. (Col 3:18) She speaks kindly to him and about him.​—Pr 31:26.
Parents give their children their time. (De 6:6, 7) They tell their children that they love them. (Mt 3:17) When giving discipline, they show love and discernment.​—Eph 6:4.
Children honor and obey their parents. (Pr 23:22) They let their parents know their thoughts and feelings. They accept discipline from their parents and show them respect.​—Pr 19:20.
