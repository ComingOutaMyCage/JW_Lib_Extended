Imitate Jehovah’s Loyal Love




Jehovah provides the greatest example of loyal love. (Ps 103:11) This love is no momentary attraction or fickle affection. Loyal love involves a deep, lasting attachment. Jehovah demonstrated this quality for his people Israel in many ways. He freed them from bondage in Egypt and brought them into the Promised Land. (Ps 105:42-44) He fought for his people and repeatedly forgave them when they sinned. (Ps 107:19, 20) As we “carefully consider Jehovah’s acts of loyal love,” we are motivated to imitate him.​—Ps 107:43.
