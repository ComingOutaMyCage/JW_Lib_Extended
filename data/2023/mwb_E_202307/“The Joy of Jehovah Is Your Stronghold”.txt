Ezra reading the Law to the people and praising Jehovah



TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold”




The people congregated to hear Ezra read the Law (Ne 8:1, 2; w13 10/15 21 ¶2; see cover picture)
This was to be a joyous time in the worship of Jehovah, not a time to mourn over past sins (Ne 8:9, 11, 12)
The joy of Jehovah is a stronghold for his servants (Ne 8:10; w07 7/15 22 ¶9-10)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘Despite challenges, what specific reasons do I have for joy?’
