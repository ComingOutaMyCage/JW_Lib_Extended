(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 24:14</a>) How can you participate? Share a scripture regarding God’s Kingdom with as many people as possible during the month. If someone expresses interest, offer the person a copy of the public edition of <a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:2020083/"><em>The Watchtower</em> No. 2 2020</a>. Then follow up on the interest as soon as possible, and try to start a Bible study using the <em>Enjoy Life Forever!</em> brochure. All those serving as auxiliary pioneers during the month of September may choose a 15- or 30-hour requirement.</p>
