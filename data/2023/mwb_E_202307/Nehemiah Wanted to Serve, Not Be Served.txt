TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Nehemiah Wanted to Serve, Not Be Served




Nehemiah did not use his authority for selfish gain (Ne 5:14, 15, 17, 18; w02 11/1 27 ¶3)
Nehemiah did not just oversee the work; he also participated in it (Ne 5:16; w16.09 6 ¶16)
Nehemiah asked Jehovah to remember him for his self-sacrificing love (Ne 5:19; w00 2/1 32)
Although Nehemiah was the governor, he did not expect special treatment. He is a good example for those who have privileges and responsibilities in the congregation.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘Am I more interested in what I can do for others than in what others can do for me?’
