TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“Do Not Interfere With the Work”




High Priest Jeshua (Joshua) and Governor Zerubbabel took the lead in rebuilding the temple despite a ban (Ezr 5:1, 2; w22.03 18 ¶13)
When opposers asked who authorized the work, the Jews referred to Cyrus’ decree (Ezr 5:3, 17; w86 2/1 29, box ¶2-3)
The king confirmed the earlier decree and ordered opposers to stop interfering with the work (Ezr 6:7, 8; w22.03 15 ¶7)





FOR MEDITATION: How does this Bible account help us to follow direction that we may not fully understand from those whom Jehovah has appointed to take the lead?​—w22.03 19 ¶16.
