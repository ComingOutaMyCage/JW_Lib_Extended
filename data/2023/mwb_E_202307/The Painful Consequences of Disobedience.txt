TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
The Painful Consequences of Disobedience




Some Israelites formed marriage alliances with idol-worshipping people (Ezr 9:1, 2; w06 1/15 20 ¶1)
They disregarded Jehovah’s clear commands (Ezr 9:10-12)
Their disobedience resulted in much pain to themselves and their families (Ezr 10:10, 11, 44)





Every commandment of Jehovah is for our good. (w09 10/1 10 ¶6) Obedience will spare us many frustrations now and lead to endless future blessings.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How has my obedience to Jehovah shielded me from unnecessary heartache?’
