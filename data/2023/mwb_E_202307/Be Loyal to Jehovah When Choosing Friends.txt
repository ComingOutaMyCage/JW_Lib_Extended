TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Be Loyal to Jehovah When Choosing Friends




Ammonites and Moabites were not permitted to “enter the congregation” because of their history of opposition to God’s people (Ne 13:1, 2; it-1 95 ¶5)
High Priest Eliashib allowed an Ammonite to make use of a dining hall in the temple (Ne 13:4, 5; w13 8/15 4 ¶5-6)
Nehemiah showed loyalty to Jehovah by ending Eliashib’s arrangement with God’s enemy (Ne 13:7-9)
If we choose friends who do not love Jehovah, are we being loyal to Jehovah?​—w96 3/15 16 ¶6.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How does Jehovah feel about my choice of associates?’
