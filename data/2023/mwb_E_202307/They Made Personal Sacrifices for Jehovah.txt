TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
They Made Personal Sacrifices for Jehovah




Families were asked to leave their hereditary possession and move to Jerusalem (Ne 11:1; w98 10/15 22 ¶13)
Those who were willing to make such sacrifices were blessed (Ne 11:2; w86 2/15 26)
Blessings from Jehovah are always greater than any sacrifices we may make (Mal 3:10; w16.04 8 ¶15)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘What blessings have I received for the sacrifices that I have made to serve Jehovah?’
