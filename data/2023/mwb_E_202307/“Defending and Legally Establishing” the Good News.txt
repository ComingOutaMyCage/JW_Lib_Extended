LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
“Defending and Legally Establishing” the Good News




When opposers tried to stop the Israelites from rebuilding the temple, the builders endeavored to establish their legal right to proceed. (Ezr 5:11-16) Christians have similarly worked to defend and legally establish the good news. (Php 1:7) To that end, a Legal Department was created at world headquarters in 1936. Today, the World Headquarters Legal Department organizes the defense of Kingdom interests worldwide. How has this department promoted Kingdom interests and benefited God’s people?

  Where on our website can we find legal developments affecting God’s people and a list of Jehovah’s Witnesses who are imprisoned for their faith?

Your answer







If, while you are sharing in some form of the ministry, the authorities inform you that you are violating the law, do not try to resolve matters on your own by discussing your legal rights. Instead, you should immediately and politely comply. If the one directing you to stop preaching is a police officer, tactfully obtain his badge number and the number of his precinct, if possible. Then promptly inform the elders, who will contact the branch office for further assistance.
