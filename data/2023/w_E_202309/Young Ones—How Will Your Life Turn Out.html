How would you use your power and authority? The Bible tells us about several young ones who became kings of Judah. For example, Jehoash was just 7 years old, Uzziah was 16, and Josiah was 8. Think of the pressure they felt! Difficult as their situation was, all of them had the help needed to overcome challenges and to lead productive lives.</p>

Being without a father, he followed the direction of faithful High Priest Jehoiada. That priest instructed Jehoash as if he were his own son. In response, Jehoash wisely decided to take the lead in pure worship and serve Jehovah. Jehoash even arranged for Jehovah’s temple to be repaired.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:24:1-14:24:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 24:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:24:4-14:24:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:24:13-14:24:14" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 13, 14</a>.</p>

Consider how the father of a sister named Katya helped her to make good decisions. Each day as her father took her to school, he would discuss the daily text with her. “Those discussions,” she says, “helped me to handle difficult situations that came up during the day.” What, though, if the Bible-based direction your parents give you seems to restrict your freedom? What can help you to accept their guidance? A sister named Anastasia recalls that her parents took the time to explain why they made certain rules. She states, “That helped me to accept the limitations, not as mere restrictions, but as loving protection.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:10-20:1:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 1:10</a>) Instead, he listened to his so-called friends. In fact, when Jehoash’s cousin Zechariah tried to correct him, Jehoash had him put to death.

We do not need to limit our association to those in our own age group. Remember, Jehoash was much younger than his friend Jehoiada. Regarding your choice of friends, ask yourself: ‘Do they help me to strengthen my faith in Jehovah? Are they encouraging me to live by God’s standards? Do they talk about Jehovah and his valuable truths? Do they show respect for God’s standards? Do they just tell me what I might want to hear, or do they have the courage to correct me if I stray?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:5-20:27:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 27:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:17-20:27:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 17</a>) Frankly, if your friends do not love Jehovah, you do not need them.

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> If we use social media, what should we take into consideration?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Social media can be an efficient way to stay in touch with family and friends. However, many people use this form of communication to impress others, posting photos and videos of what they have bought or done. If you use social media, ask yourself: ‘Is my motive to impress others? Is my goal to build others up, or is it to boost my image? Am I allowing the people who use this tool to influence my thinking, speech, and actions in a negative way?’ Brother Nathan Knorr, who served as a member of the Governing Body, gave this advice: “Don’t try to please men. You will wind up pleasing no one. Please Jehovah, and you will please all those who love Jehovah.”</p>

He wanted to learn about Jehovah and do His will. However, life was not easy for this young king. He had to take a stand for pure worship when false worship was prevalent. And indeed he did! Before Josiah was 20 years old, he began to remove false worship from the nation.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:34:1-14:34:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>2 Chronicles 34:1-3</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Even if you are very young, you can decide to imitate Josiah by searching for Jehovah and learning to appreciate His qualities. That fine course will move you to dedicate yourself to him. What will that dedication mean in your daily life? Luke, who got baptized at age 14, says, “From now on, I will put serving Jehovah first in my life and will try to make him happy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>) What a blessing it will be for you if you desire to do the same!</p>

Johan, who got baptized at age 12, comments on the <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>pressure that his classmates put on him to use electronic cigarettes​—vaping. To find strength to resist that pressure, Johan reminds himself that vaping could negatively affect both his health and his friendship with Jehovah. Rachel, baptized at age 14, explains what helps her to cope with the challenges she faces at school. She notes: “I try to relate what I see to something spiritual. For example, a history lesson may call to my mind a Bible account or a prophecy. Or a conversation may remind me of a useful scripture I can share with someone.” The challenges you face may differ from those King Josiah faced, but you can be wise and loyal, as he was. Dealing with trials as a youth will prepare you to face other challenges in the years ahead.</p>

During that work, “the book of Jehovah’s Law given through Moses” was found. On hearing it read, the king was moved to take action by complying with what it said. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:34:14-14:34:14" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>2 Chronicles 34:14,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:34:18-14:34:21" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> <strong>18-21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Would you like to read the Bible regularly? If you are trying, how is it going? Do you keep track of verses that may help you personally? Luke, mentioned earlier, writes down in a journal interesting points that he finds. Would doing something similar help you to recall verses or points that you like? The more you get to know and love the Bible, the more you will want to serve Jehovah. And like King Josiah, you will be moved to action by God’s Word.</p>
