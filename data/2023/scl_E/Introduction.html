<div class="boxContent"><p id="p7" data-pid="7">To find a topic, you can use the search box, or you can browse through the categories. <em>Scriptures for Christian Living</em> is divided into seven broad categories: <strong>Challenges, Conduct, Congregation, Daily Life, Family, Spirituality,</strong> and <strong>Qualities.</strong> Most topics will fall under one of those categories. Select an appropriate category, and scroll down the list of topics. However, if you are not sure which category would feature the topic that interests you, select <strong>All</strong> and scroll down the list of topics until you find the one that best suits your needs. Under each topic, you will find a number of bold headings. Some are statements; others are questions. As you read the cited verses in bold type that follow the heading, reason and meditate on how they support the statement or answer the question. <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>In some cases, a topic will be divided into subsections to help you navigate through the headings. In some cases, “See also” verses are included. These offer thoughts that are related to the topic. In many cases, you will also find “Relevant Bible account(s)” listed. A sentence introduces the key point or the lesson in the cited scripture. As you read the scripture, use the provided sentence to guide your thinking.</p>
