<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Be assured that <strong>you are not alone.</strong> Many people today are affected by mental health issues, whether their own or those of their loved ones.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Without a doubt, we are living in “critical times hard to deal with” that are causing many forms of distress. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) One study calculated that, worldwide, about one in eight people struggles with a mental health disorder. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in anxiety and major depressive disorders of about 26 and 28 percent respectively.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Our mental health, however, is not defined by statistics. It is about how you and your loved ones feel and how you live your lives.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">If you or a loved one experiences significantly noticeable changes in personality, disturbed sleeping or eating patterns, or prolonged distress, anxiety, or sadness, you may need professional help to identify and treat the root causes. But where can you go for help?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The wisest man who ever lived, Jesus Christ, stated: “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:12-40:9:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 9:12</a>) Those struggling with health challenges who receive appropriate medical therapy and medication can do much to minimize their symptoms and can be helped to live a productive and fulfilling life. It is wise for such ones not to delay treatment if the symptoms are serious or prolonged.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
