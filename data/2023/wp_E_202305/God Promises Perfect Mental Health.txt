God Promises Perfect Mental Health

Through the Bible, God provides guidance and comfort to deal with mental distress.




But God has done even more. He has promised to remove the very causes of mental disorders permanently.
When God fulfills that promise, never again will painful feelings, mental distress, and hurtful memories “be called to mind, nor will they come up into the heart.”​—Isaiah 65:17.
Jehovah’s Witnesses will be happy to help you find out when and how God will fulfill this heartwarming promise.
