<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>“Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:12-40:9:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>MATTHEW 9:12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible acknowledges that we may need to seek medical treatment. Many have found relief by learning what they can about their mental illness from reliable sources and by getting qualified professional help.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>“Exercise is good for your body.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>1 TIMOTHY 4:8</strong></a><strong>, <em>Contemporary English Version.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Investing time and energy in healthy habits may help improve your mental health. Such habits include sticking to a regular exercise routine, following a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>“A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit saps one’s strength.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>PROVERBS 17:22</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Reading encouraging Bible passages and setting reasonable and reachable goals can help maintain a happy spirit. A positive and hopeful attitude can help you to stay emotionally <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>balanced as you cope with your mental health challenges.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>“Wisdom is with the modest ones.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:2-20:11:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>PROVERBS 11:2</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">You may find that you are not able to do everything that you want to on your own, so willingly accept the help of others. Friends and family likely want to help you, but they may not know what to do. Let them know what would be especially helpful to you. Be reasonable in what you expect, and always be thankful for the help they provide.</p>
