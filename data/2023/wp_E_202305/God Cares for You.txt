God Cares for You

THE Bible is the best source of spiritual guidance available. It is not a health-care manual, but it can help us in practical ways to deal with distressing circumstances, turbulent thought patterns, painful emotions, and upsetting physical and mental health issues.




Most important, the Bible assures us that our Creator, Jehovah God,a understands our thoughts and feelings better than anyone else. He is eager to help us deal with any issues we face. Consider, for example, two comforting Bible passages:
“Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”​—PSALM 34:18.
“I, Jehovah your God, am grasping your right hand, the One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid. I will help you.’”​—ISAIAH 41:13.
How, though, does Jehovah help us to deal with mental health problems? As you will see in the following articles, Jehovah shows that he truly cares for us in many helpful ways.



a Jehovah is God’s personal name.​—Psalm 83:18.
