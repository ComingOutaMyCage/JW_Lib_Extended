<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>3-4.</strong> Where can young sisters find good examples to imitate? (See also picture.)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The Bible mentions many remarkable women who loved Jehovah and served him. (See on jw.org the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:502019181/">Women in the Bible​—What Can We Learn From <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>Them?</a>”) They were, as our theme text advises, “moderate in habits” and “faithful in all things.” In addition, sisters can find in their own congregation examples of mature Christian women who are worthy of imitation.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Young sisters, why not identify a few mature Christian women you know whose example you can imitate? Note their appealing qualities; then consider how you can manifest them. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss three important qualities needed by mature women.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> Why is humility essential for a mature Christian woman?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Humility</em></strong> is an important aspect of Christian maturity. If a woman is humble, she will enjoy a good relationship with Jehovah and with others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:6-59:4:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 4:6</a>) For example, a woman who loves Jehovah humbly chooses to support the principle of headship that her heavenly Father established. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:3</a>) That principle has specific applications in the congregation and in the family arrangement.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What can young sisters learn about humility from Rebekah?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider the example of Rebekah. She was an intelligent and decisive woman who took the initiative in appropriate ways throughout her life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:58-1:24:58" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 24:58;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:5-1:27:17" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 27:5-17</a>) Yet, she was respectful and submissive. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:17-1:24:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 24:17, 18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:65-1:24:65" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 65</a>) If you humbly support Jehovah’s arrangements, as Rebekah did, you will be a positive influence on your family and on the congregation.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> How can young sisters imitate Esther in showing modesty?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Modesty</em></strong> is another quality that all mature Christians need. The Bible says <span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>that “wisdom is with the modest ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:2-20:11:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 11:2</a>) Esther was a modest, godly woman. Her modesty protected her from acting presumptuously. She listened to the advice of her older cousin Mordecai and followed it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:10-17:2:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 2:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:20-17:2:20" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:22-17:2:22" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 22</a>) You can demonstrate similar modesty by seeking out and applying good advice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:3-56:2:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Titus 2:3-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:9, 10</a>, how will modesty help a sister make wise choices in dress and grooming?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Esther showed modesty in another way. She was “beautifully formed and attractive in appearance”; yet, she did not draw undue attention to herself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:7-17:2:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Esther 2:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:15-17:2:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 15</a>) How can a Christian woman benefit from Esther’s example? One way is highlighted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 2:9, 10</strong></a><strong>. (Read.)</strong> The apostle Paul instructed Christian women to dress with modesty and soundness of mind. The Greek words used here suggest that a Christian woman’s dress would be respectable and would show consideration for the feelings or opinions of others. How we admire our mature Christian sisters for dressing modestly!</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What can we learn from the example of Abigail?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Discernment</em></strong> is another quality that all mature Christian sisters demonstrate. What is discernment? It is good judgment​—the ability to tell right from wrong and then to choose the wise course. Consider the example of Abigail. Her husband made a bad decision that was going to have a serious impact on his entire household. Abigail took immediate action. Her good judgment saved lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:14-9:25:23" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:14-23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:32-9:25:35" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 32-35</a>) Discernment also helps us to know when to speak and when to keep silent. And it helps us to maintain balance when showing personal interest in others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:11-52:4:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:11</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:8</a>) If you are not sure that you understand what a person is saying or how he feels, ask appropriate questions.

Ask yourself: ‘Is what I am about to say true and upbuilding?
