You can also find good examples among the mature Christian men in your own family and in your congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7</a>) And you have the perfect example of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21</a>) As you carefully study these examples, consider their outstanding qualities.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Develop and “safeguard . . . thinking ability.”</em></strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:21-20:3:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 3:21</a>) A man with thinking ability considers his options carefully before acting. So work hard to gain and maintain that ability. Why? This world is full of young men who are guided by their own ideas or who allow emotions to control their actions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:7-20:7:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 7:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:11-20:29:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 29:11</a>) The media can also exert a strong influence on you. But how can you acquire thinking ability? Begin by learning Bible principles and thinking about why these are beneficial. Then use those principles to help you make decisions that will please Jehovah. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:9-19:119:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 119:9</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> If you develop this important skill, you will have taken a major step toward becoming a mature Christian man. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:11-20:2:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 2:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Heb. 5:14</a>) Consider how thinking ability will benefit you in two situations: (1) in dealing with sisters and (2) in making decisions about your personal appearance.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> How will thinking ability help a young brother show respect for sisters?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Thinking ability will help you show respect for women. It is normal and proper for a young brother to be interested in developing a relationship with a Christian sister. However, a young man with thinking ability would not say, write, or do anything that would signal romantic interest unless he is sincerely considering the sister as a potential marriage mate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:1-54:5:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:1, 2</a>) If he is dating a sister, he would protect her good <span id="page26" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>reputation by never being alone with her unless properly chaperoned.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Another way a young man shows that he has developed sound thinking ability is by making good choices in dress and grooming. Often, fashion trends are designed and promoted by people who have no regard for Jehovah or who lead immoral lives. Their immoral thinking is reflected in clothing styles that are tight-fitting or tend to make men look like women. When choosing what to wear, a young man who is growing to Christian maturity will be guided by Bible principles and by good examples in the congregation. He can ask himself: ‘Do my choices show that I am sound in mind and considerate of others? Does the way I dress make it easy for others to believe that I am devoted to serving God?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:31-46:10:33" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:31-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:6-56:2:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Titus 2:6</a>) A young man with thinking ability will gain the respect of not only his brothers and sisters but also his heavenly Father.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How can a young brother learn to be reliable?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Be reliable.</em></strong> A young man who is reliable diligently cares for all his responsibilities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:10-42:16:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a>) Consider the perfect example of Jesus. He was never careless or irresponsible. Instead, he fulfilled the assignments that Jehovah gave him, even when it was difficult to do so. He loved people​—especially his disciples—​and he willingly gave his life for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:1-43:13:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 13:1</a>) In imitation of Jesus, work hard to fulfill any assignment that you are given.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rom. 12:11</a>) Instead, complete your assignment, doing it “for Jehovah, and not for men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:23-51:3:23" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Col. 3:23</a>) Of course, you are not perfect, so be modest and admit any mistakes you make.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:2-20:11:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 11:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Full-time servant.</em></strong> Many mature Christian men began the full-time ministry at a young age. Pioneering helps a young man to learn how to work effectively with a variety of people. It also helps him to make a reasonable budget and live by it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:11-50:4:13" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Phil. 4:11-13</a>) A good stepping stone to full-time service is auxiliary pioneering. Many serve as an auxiliary pioneer for some time, which helps them to be ready to take up regular pioneering. Pioneering may open the door to other forms of full-time service, including serving as a construction servant or a Bethelite.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>15-16.</strong> How can a young brother qualify to serve in the congregation?</p>

Ministerial servants assist the elders in many practical ways. Both elders and ministerial servants humbly serve their brothers and sisters and share zealously in the ministry. Young brothers can qualify to serve as ministerial servants even when they are still in their late teens. And a well-qualified ministerial servant in his early 20’s may be appointed as an elder.</p>
