<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One day a sister in New Zealand watched the video <em>“</em><a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?lank=pub-jwb_202012_11_VIDEO&amp;wtlocale=E" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=jwb&amp;issue=202012&amp;track=11"><em>Have . . . Concern for One Another</em></a><em>,”</em> which discusses how Jehovah not only feels compassion but also shows it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:7-23:63:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 63:7-9</a>) She decided to apply what she learned by giving practical help. Later that day while grocery shopping, she met a homeless woman and offered to buy her a meal. The woman accepted. When the sister returned with the meal, she gave a brief witness, using the tract <em>Will Suffering Ever End?</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The woman broke down in tears. She explained that she had been raised as a Witness but left the truth many years ago. Recently, though, she had been praying to Jehovah for help to return to him. The sister gave the woman a Bible and made arrangements for a study.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We can imitate Jehovah’s compassion for people, including our relatives and our brothers and sisters in the congregation. And we can show compassion by looking for opportunities to witness to others.</p>
