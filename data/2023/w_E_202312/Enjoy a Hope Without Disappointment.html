<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong> Why can we say that Abraham’s hope was well-placed?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JEHOVAH promised his friend Abraham that all nations of the earth would be blessed by means of his offspring. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:5-1:15:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 15:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 22:18</a>) Because Abraham had deep faith in God, he was convinced that God’s promise would come true. Even so, when Abraham was 100 years of age and his wife was 90, that faithful couple still did not have a son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:1-1:21:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 21:1-7</a>) Yet, the Bible says: “Based on hope, [Abraham] had faith that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:18-45:4:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 4:18</a>) You know that Abraham’s hope was realized. He did become father to the son he had long hoped for, Isaac. What was the basis for Abraham’s confidence?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong> Why was Abraham convinced that Jehovah’s promise would come true?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Because of his close personal relationship with Jehovah, Abraham was “fully convinced that what [God] had promised” would come true. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:21-45:4:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 4:21</a>) Jehovah approved of Abraham and declared him righteous because of his faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 2:23</a>) As indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:18-45:4:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 4:18</a>, Abraham’s faith and his hope were connected. Let us now consider what the apostle Paul says about hope, as recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:1-45:5:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">chapter 5 of Romans</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What does Paul explain about hope?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Paul explains why we can be sure that our “hope does not lead to disappointment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:5-45:5:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 5:5</a>) He also helps us <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>to understand how our Christian hope can grow. As we examine the process Paul outlines at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:1-45:5:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 5:1-5</a>, consider your own experience. In doing so, you will likely recognize that over time your Christian hope has become more certain. Our discussion will also reveal how you can make your hope grow even stronger than it is now. Let us first consider a glorious hope that Paul says will not lead to disappointment.</p>

The brothers and sisters there had learned about Jehovah and Jesus, had exercised faith, and had become Christians. God thus “declared [them] righteous as a result of faith,” and he anointed them with holy spirit. Yes, they gained a valid, wonderful hope.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Paul later wrote to anointed Christians in Ephesus about the hope to which they were called.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Anointed Christians cherish that hope. One of them, Brother Frederick Franz, said from his heart: “Our hope is a sure thing, and it will be fulfilled fully to every last one of the 144,000 members of the little flock to a degree beyond what we have even <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>imagined.” After serving God faithfully for decades, in 1991 Brother Franz affirmed: “[We] have not lost our sense of value of that hope. . . . We are appreciating it all the more the longer we have to wait for it. It is something <em>worth</em> waiting for, even if it required a million years. I evaluate our hope more highly than ever before.”</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Most who worship Jehovah today have a different hope. It is the hope that Abraham had​—everlasting life on earth under God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:8-58:11:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 11:8-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:13-58:11:13" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Paul wrote about the glorious outcome awaiting those who have that hope. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:20-45:8:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 8:20, 21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> When you first learned of the Bible’s promise for the future, what did you find most appealing about it? Was it the fact that one day you will be perfect, no longer prone to sin? Or were you thrilled to learn that your dead loved ones will live again on a paradise earth? This gave you much to look forward to “on the basis of hope.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Whether we expect to enjoy everlasting life in heaven or on earth, we have a glorious hope that gives us reason to rejoice.

Doing so will make us more confident that our hope will keep growing and will never let us down.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>9-10.</strong> As shown by Paul’s example, what can Christians expect? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:3-45:5:3" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Romans 5:3</a>) (See also pictures.)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:3-45:5:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 5:3</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Note that <strong><em>tribulation</em></strong> may be involved in developing a stronger hope. That may surprise us. In reality, all followers of Christ can expect tribulation. Consider Paul’s example. He said to those in Thessalonica: <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>“When we were with you, we used to tell you in advance that we would suffer tribulation, and that is what has happened.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:3:4-52:3:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Thess. 3:4</a>) And to the Corinthians, he wrote: “We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the tribulation we experienced . . . We were very uncertain even of our lives.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:8-47:1:8" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:23-47:11:27" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 11:23-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Christians today, too, can expect tribulation of some sort. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:12</a>) What about you? As you put faith in Jesus and follow him, has tribulation come your way? Friends and relatives may have ridiculed you. They may even have been hostile. Has your determination to be honest in all things created problems for you at work? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Heb. 13:18</a>) Have you faced governmental opposition because you shared your hope with others? No matter what type of tribulation we may encounter, though, Paul says we should rejoice. Why?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> Why do we need to be determined to endure any trial?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> We can rejoice when undergoing tribulation because of what it produces. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:3-45:5:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Romans 5:3</a> says, “tribulation produces <strong><em>endurance.”</em></strong> All Christians will face tribulation, so all Christians must have endurance. We need to be determined to endure whatever trials we may face. Only then will we be able to see the fulfillment of our hope. We do not want to be like those whom Jesus had in mind when speaking about seeds that fell on rocky soil. They accepted the word with joy at first but “after tribulation or persecution” arose, they were stumbled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:5-40:13:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 13:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:20-40:13:21" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>) Granted, facing opposition or trials is not easy or pleasant, but enduring them brings definite benefits. In what way?</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> How do we benefit when we endure trials?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> The disciple James highlighted the benefits of enduring trials. He wrote: “Let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jas. 1:2-4</a>) James describes endurance as if it had a task, a work, to perform. What work is endurance assigned to accomplish? It can help you to develop to a greater degree such qualities as patience, faith, and reliance on God. However, we gain another significant benefit from enduring.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>13-14.</strong> What does endurance produce, and how does that relate to hope? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:4-45:5:4" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Romans 5:4</a>)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:4-45:5:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 5:4</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Paul mentions that endurance results in “an <strong><em>approved condition.”</em></strong> Your endurance brings Jehovah’s approval. This does not mean that Jehovah is pleased that you are experiencing trials or problems. What God approves of is <strong><em>you.</em></strong> Your endurance results in an approved condition. What an amazing blessing!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:5:12-19:5:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 5:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Recall that Abraham endured tests and enjoyed divine approval. Jehovah viewed him as His friend and counted him as righteous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:6-1:15:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Gen. 15:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:13-45:4:13" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Rom. 4:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:22-45:4:22" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 22</a>) The same can be true of us. God does not base his approval on the amount of work we do in his service or on the privileges we enjoy. He grants his approval because of our faithful endurance. And no matter what our age, circumstance, or ability is, all of us can endure. Are you faithfully enduring a <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>trial right now? If so, take comfort in knowing that you have God’s approval. Realizing that we have God’s approval can have a powerful effect on us. It can strengthen our hope.</p>

Why? Because earlier, as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:2-45:5:2" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Romans 5:2</a>, Paul mentioned that those Christians in Rome already had a hope, the “hope of the glory of God.” Consequently, someone might ask, ‘If those Christians already had a hope, why does Paul list hope later in his discussion?’</p>

At that point, you may have thought that the idea of living forever on a paradise earth was mere wishful thinking. However, as you got better acquainted with Jehovah and with the Bible’s promises, you became more convinced that this hope would become a reality.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>17.</strong> How does your hope continue to grow after your dedication and baptism?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Even after your dedication and baptism, your hope continued to grow as you learned more and matured spiritually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:13-58:6:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Heb. 5:13–6:1</a>) You have likely experienced what is mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:2-45:5:4" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Romans 5:2-4</a>.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> The apostle adds a very important point regarding the hope that you possess after receiving God’s approval. He assures you that your hope <strong><em>will be fulfilled.</em></strong> Why can you be so sure? Paul includes this inspired guarantee to Christians: “The hope does not lead to disappointment; because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit, which was given to us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:5-45:5:5" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rom. 5:5</a>) You have every reason to be certain of that hope​—your hope.</p>
