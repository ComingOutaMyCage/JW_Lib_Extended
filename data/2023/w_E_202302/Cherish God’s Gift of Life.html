<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IMAGINE that a friend gave you a very old but priceless painting​—a masterpiece. It has some discoloration, stains, and cracks. Despite the imperfections, the painting is valued at millions of dollars. Surely you would appreciate and protect that piece of art. Similarly, Jehovah has given us a valuable gift, the gift of life. In fact, Jehovah shows how much he values our life by giving his Son as a ransom for us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong> As indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>, what does Jehovah expect from us?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jehovah is the Source of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9</a>) The apostle Paul acknowledged this truth when he said: “By him we have life and move and exist.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:25-44:17:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 17:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:28-44:17:28" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 28</a>) So we can appropriately refer to our life as a gift from God. He lovingly provides us with what we need to stay alive. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:15-44:14:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 14:15-17</a>) But Jehovah does not preserve our lives miraculously. Rather, he expects us to care for our physical and spiritual health to the best of our ability. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 7:1</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Why should we protect our health and life, and how can we do so?</p>

<div class="pGroup">

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> One reason why we should try to stay healthy is that <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>we can serve Jehovah to the best of our ability. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>) We desire to present our “bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,” so we avoid choosing to do things that we know will harm our health. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 12:1</a>) Granted, there is only so much that we can do to stay in good health. But we do what we can because we want to show our heavenly Father that we appreciate the gift of life.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> What did King David want to do?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> King David explained why he cherished God’s gift of life when he wrote: “What profit is there in my death, in my going down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:30:9-19:30:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 30:9</a>) David may have written those words toward the end of his life. But he was determined to stay alive and well as long as possible so that he could praise Jehovah. No doubt, all of us have that same determination.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> No matter how old or how sick we are, what can we do?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Sickness and old age may prevent us from doing many of the things we once did. As a result, we may feel frustrated and sad. But never should we give up and neglect our health. Why not? Because no matter how old or how sick we are, we can still praise Jehovah, as did King David. How touching it is to realize that our God treasures us despite our being imperfect! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:29-40:10:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 10:29-31</a>) Even if we were to die, he would long to resurrect us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:14-18:14:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>) While we are alive, we want to do what we can to protect our health and life.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Although the Bible is not a health-care book or a dietary manual, it does reveal Jehovah’s thinking in these areas. For example, he exhorts us to “ward off harmful things” that could damage our body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:10-21:11:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:10</a>) Gluttony and drunkenness, both life-threatening, are condemned in the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:20-20:23:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 23:20</a>) Jehovah expects us to exercise self-control when deciding what and how much to eat and drink.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:12-46:6:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:25-46:9:25" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 9:25</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We can make decisions that show deep appreciation for God’s gift of life by using our thinking ability.

If we like a certain food but know that it makes us sick, common sense moves us to avoid eating it. We also prove that we are sound in mind when we get sufficient sleep, exercise regularly, maintain a good routine of personal hygiene, and keep our home clean.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s Law to the nation of Israel included guidelines that would help prevent serious accidents from occurring at home and at work.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:4-5:19:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deut. 19:4, 5</a>) The Law required that <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>even those who unintentionally harmed an unborn child be punished. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:22-2:21:23" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 21:22, 23</a>) The Scriptures make it clear that Jehovah wants us to be safety conscious.</p>

For example, we dispose of sharp objects, toxic chemicals, or medicines in a safe way, and we keep such items out of the reach of young children. We are cautious when handling open flames, hot liquids, and power tools, not leaving them unattended. We do not drive a car while our judgment is impaired by medication, alcohol, or lack of sleep, and we do not allow ourselves to be distracted by using a handheld device while driving.</p>

However, when such calamities strike, we can try to reduce risks and improve our likelihood of survival by obeying curfews, evacuation orders, and emergency restrictions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:5-45:13:7" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 5-7</a>) Some threats can be anticipated, so we do well to follow any guidelines issued by the local authorities to help us prepare for a disaster.

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> When threatened by a contagious disease, what should we be willing to do?</p>

We should obey emergency regulations, such as those regarding washing our hands, social distancing, wearing a mask, and quarantining.

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> How does the principle found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a> help us to be selective when it comes to information that circulates during a calamity?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> During emergencies, inaccurate information may circulate among friends, among neighbors, and in the media. Rather than believe “every word” we hear, we do well to listen to the most reliable governmental and medical sources available. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 14:15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> The Governing Body and the branch offices make every effort to obtain accurate information before giving direction regarding congregation meetings and the preaching work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 13:17</a>) By being cooperative, we protect ourselves and others from harm.
