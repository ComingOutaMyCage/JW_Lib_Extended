<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many of our brothers and sisters use the articles advertised on the jw.org home page in the ministry. They are easy to forward electronically, and they often explain how current events fulfill Bible prophecy. As one brother wrote, home page articles have been “exactly the right thing for our current form of ministry.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But the advertisements are regularly refreshed, so how can you find articles that no longer appear on the home page?</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  On the home page of jw.org, click the “See More” link near the top of the page. This link opens the page entitled “Recently Featured on the Home Page,” where you will find more of the most recently advertised articles.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  On jw.org or in <em>JW Library</em><sup>®</sup>, select “Library,” then “Article Series,” and finally “More Topics.” This section includes many of the articles that have been featured on the home page.</p>
