<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Years before he began his ministry, Jesus read and heard God’s Word repeatedly.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:16-42:4:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 4:16</a>) While there, he must have listened carefully as the Scriptures were read. In time, Jesus learned to read those Sacred Writings on his own. <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>As a result, Jesus not only came to know the Scriptures well but also loved them and allowed them to influence his actions. For example, recall the incident in the temple when Jesus was just 12 years old. The teachers who were well-versed in the Mosaic Law were in “amazement at [Jesus’] understanding and his answers.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:46-42:2:47" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 2:46, 47,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:52-42:2:52" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 52</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> We too can come to know and love God’s Word as we regularly read the Scriptures. How, though, can we get the most out of what we read? We can learn from what Jesus said to those familiar with the Law, including the scribes, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees. Those religious leaders read the Scriptures often, but they failed to benefit from what they read. Jesus highlighted three ways in which these men were not getting the most out of the Scriptures. His words to them will help us improve in our ability (1) to understand what we read, (2) to find spiritual treasures, and (3) to allow God’s Word to mold us.</p>

Otherwise, our reading may not fully benefit us. For example, consider Jesus’ conversation with “a man versed in the Law.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:25-42:10:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 10:25-29</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> When the man asked what he needed to do to gain everlasting life, Jesus directed him to God’s Word by asking: “What is written in the Law? <strong><em>How do you read?”</em></strong> The man was able to give the right answer by quoting the scriptures about loving God and loving neighbor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 19:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:5-5:6:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:5</a>) But note what he said next: “Who really is my neighbor?” The man revealed that he did not understand the real meaning of what he had read.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> We can increase our understanding of God’s Word by developing good reading habits. Here are some suggestions that can assist you. <strong><em>Pray</em></strong> before you begin reading. We need Jehovah’s help to understand the Scriptures, so we can ask him for his holy spirit in order to concentrate. Then <strong><em>read at a slow pace.</em></strong> That will help you comprehend the material. You might find it beneficial to read aloud or to follow along with an audio recording of the Bible. You will thereby engage more of your senses, which can deepen the impression that God’s Word makes on your mind and heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>) When you are finished reading, <strong><em>pray again</em></strong> to thank Jehovah for the gift of his Word and to ask for his help to apply what you have read.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Here are two more suggestions to enhance your understanding of the Bible. <strong><em>Ask yourself questions</em></strong> about what you read. As you consider a particular <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>account, ask: ‘Who are the main characters? Who is speaking? To whom is he speaking, and why? Where and when is the action taking place?’ Such questions will help you to think about and follow the main ideas of the passage. Also, <strong><em>take brief notes</em></strong> as you read. When you write, you force yourself to put thoughts into words, which helps to clarify your thinking. Writing also helps you remember what you read. You might jot down questions, record the results of your research, summarize main points, note how you can use what you have read, or simply record your feelings. You may find that writing down such notes can help you view God’s Word as his personal message to you.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Jesus identified an important quality that we need if we are to understand what we read in God’s Word​—discernment. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 24:15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> What is discernment? It is the ability to grasp how one idea relates to another and how it differs from another and to see what is not immediately obvious. In addition, as Jesus indicated, we need discernment to identify events that fulfill Bible prophecy. We also need this quality so that we can benefit fully from everything we read in the Bible.</p>

You can obtain those four benefits even from Bible books that you do not use often. Analyze the account to see what it <strong><em>teaches</em></strong> you about Jehovah, about his purpose, or about godly principles. Consider how it is helpful for <strong><em>reproving.</em></strong> Do this by noting how the verses help you to identify and reject wrong tendencies or attitudes and to remain on a faithful course. Examine how the passage can be used to <strong><em>set straight,</em></strong> or correct, a wrong viewpoint, perhaps one you have encountered in the ministry.

In reply, Jesus cited two Scriptural examples and quoted a verse from Hosea to show that the Pharisees had missed the point of the Sabbath law and had failed to show mercy. Why were these men not molded by their reading of God’s Word? Because they read it with a critical and proud spirit.

Many others also read the Bible; yet, they do not really understand what they read. That was true of some people in Jesus’ day too. By examining what Jesus said to those who read God’s Word, we will draw lessons that can help us get more out of our Bible reading.</p></div>
<div id="footnote2" data-fnid="2" class="fn-ref"><p id="p33" data-pid="33"><a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> At the time of his baptism and his being anointed with holy spirit, Jesus’ memory of his prehuman existence was evidently restored to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 3:16</a>.</p></div>
<div id="footnote3" data-fnid="3" class="fn-ref"><p id="p34" data-pid="34"><a href="#footnotesource3" class="fn-symbol">c</a> Mary knew the Scriptures well and referred to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:46-42:1:55" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 1:46-55</a>) Likely, Joseph and Mary could not afford personal copies of the Scriptures. They must have listened carefully when God’s Word was read at the synagogue so that they could recall it later.</p></div>

<div id="footnote5" data-fnid="5" class="fn-ref"><p id="p36" data-pid="36"><a href="#footnotesource5" class="fn-symbol">e</a> See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:4-40:19:6" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 19:4-6</a>, where Jesus asked the Pharisees this same question: “Have you not read?” Although they had read the creation account, they overlooked what it taught about God’s view of marriage.</p></div>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div id="footnote6" data-fnid="6" class="fn-ref"><p id="p68" data-pid="68"><a href="#footnotesource6" class="fn-symbol">f</a> <strong>PICTURE DESCRIPTION:</strong> During a meeting at the Kingdom Hall, one of the brothers who assists in caring for the audio and video makes several mistakes.
