<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“FIND exquisite delight in Jehovah, and he will grant you the desires of your heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:4-19:37:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 37:4</a>) What an amazing promise! But should we expect Jehovah to give us everything we ask for right away? Why might we ask that question? Consider the following scenarios. A single sister prays about attending the School for Kingdom Evangelizers. But several years go by, and she has still not been invited. A young brother asks Jehovah to be relieved of a debilitating disease so that he can serve in the congregation more fully. But his health does not improve. Christian parents pray that their child will stay in the truth. But their child decides to stop serving Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Perhaps you too have asked Jehovah for something, but you have not received it. As a result, you may conclude that Jehovah answers some prayers but not yours. Or you may reason that you must have done something wrong. A sister named Janice<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> felt that way. She and her husband prayed about their desire to serve at Bethel. She says: “I was convinced that we would be at Bethel in no time.” But months turned into years, and the couple had still not been invited. Janice says: “I felt sad and confused. I wondered what I had done to disappoint Jehovah. I had prayed so specifically for his direction. <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>Why had he not answered my prayer?”</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What will we discuss in this article?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> At times, we may wonder if Jehovah is listening to our prayers. Even some faithful men of old had that concern. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:30:20-18:30:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 30:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:2-19:22:2" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 22:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:2-35:1:2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Hab. 1:2</a>) What can convince you that Jehovah will respond to your prayers? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>) To help answer that question, we will first need to answer the following: (1) What can we expect from Jehovah? (2) What does Jehovah expect from us? (3) Why may we need to adjust some of our requests?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:12-24:29:12" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:12</a>, what does Jehovah promise to do?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Jehovah promises to listen to our prayers.</em> (Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:12-24:29:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Jeremiah 29:12</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Our God loves his faithful worshippers, so he will never ignore their prayers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:17-19:10:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 10:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 37:28</a>) However, this does not mean that he will grant us all our requests. We may have to wait until the new world before we receive some of the things we ask for.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What does Jehovah consider when listening to our prayers? Explain.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Jehovah considers how our requests relate to his overall purpose.</em></strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:8-23:55:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 55:8, 9</a>) Part of that purpose includes filling the earth with men and women who are joyfully united under his rulership. But Satan claims that humans would be better off ruling themselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-5</a>) To prove that the Devil’s claim is a lie, Jehovah has allowed humans to govern themselves. Yet, human rule has caused many of the problems we face today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:9</a>) We understand that Jehovah will not remove all these problems at this time. If he were to do so, some might conclude that human rule does work, that it is able to solve mankind’s problems.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> Why do we need to be convinced that Jehovah will always do what is loving and just?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Jehovah may respond to similar requests in different ways.</em></strong> For example, when King Hezekiah was extremely sick, he begged Jehovah to help him recover. In response, Jehovah healed him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:20:1-12:20:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:1-6</a>) On the other hand, when the apostle Paul pleaded with Jehovah to remove his “thorn in the flesh,” possibly a physical ailment, Jehovah did not remove the problem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:7-47:12:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:7-9</a>) Consider also the example of the apostles James and Peter. They both faced certain death at the hands of King Herod. The congregation prayed for Peter and likely for James too. However, James was put to death, while Peter was miraculously rescued. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:1-44:12:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 12:1-11</a>) We may wonder, ‘Why did Jehovah save Peter but not James?’ The Bible does not say.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> What we can be sure of is that Jehovah’s ways are “never unjust.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4</a>) And we know that both Peter and James had Jehovah’s approval. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:14-66:21:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 21:14</a>) At times, we may be faced with an outcome we did not expect. But because we trust that Jehovah’s answer to our prayers will always be loving and just, we do not question the way he chooses to answer us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:13-18:33:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 33:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What do we try to avoid, and why?</p>

For instance, we may ask Jehovah to help us in a specific way, but our request is not granted. Later, we learn that someone else made a similar request, and Jehovah seemed to have granted it. A sister named Anna had that experience. She prayed that her husband, Matthew, might recover from cancer. At the same time, two elderly Christian sisters were also battling cancer. Anna prayed intensely for Matthew and for the sisters. The sisters recovered, but Matthew passed away. At first, Anna wondered if the sisters got well because Jehovah intervened. And if so, why did he not answer her prayers that her husband get better? Of course, we cannot say why the two sisters recovered. What we do know is that Jehovah has a permanent solution for all our suffering, and he longs to resurrect his friends who have died.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:15-18:14:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 14:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Jehovah will always support us.</em></strong> As our loving Father, Jehovah does not like to see us in pain.

And he will not allow our trials to cause us permanent harm. Jehovah also gives us his powerful holy spirit to help us endure.

If we are praying about a problem, there may be a better solution to the problem than the one we are asking for. And some things we ask for may not be in harmony with Jehovah’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:14" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 John 5:14</a>) For instance, consider the example of the parents mentioned earlier.

Later, one of them is invited, but the other is not. Instead of becoming overly disappointed, the sister who was not invited prays to Jehovah to help her identify other opportunities to expand her ministry. Then she writes a letter to the branch office, volunteering to serve where the need is greater.</p></div>
