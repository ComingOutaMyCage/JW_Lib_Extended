<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>DO YOU at times worry about the future? Perhaps you have lost your job and you worry about providing for your family. You may be concerned about your family’s safety because of unstable political conditions, persecution, or opposition to the preaching work. Are you facing any of these issues? If so, you will benefit from considering how Jehovah helped the ancient Israelites when they were confronted with similar problems.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> It took faith on the part of the Jews who had lived in Babylon all their lives to leave behind a comfortable lifestyle and travel to a country that most of them knew very little about. When they arrived, it was not long before they were affected by unstable economic and political conditions as well as opposition. Some therefore found it hard to focus on rebuilding Jehovah’s temple. Thus, about 520 B.C.E., Jehovah commissioned two prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, to rekindle the people’s zeal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:1-37:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:1-38:1:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Zech. 1:1</a>) As we will see, the encouragement given by these prophets proved to be very effective. Nearly 50 years later, however, the returning Jews again reached a low point. Ezra, a skilled copyist of the Law, then came from Babylon to Jerusalem to encourage God’s people to give priority to true worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:1-15:7:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:6-15:7:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>4-5.</strong> What may have caused the Jews’ enthusiasm for the temple work to wane?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> When the returning Jews arrived in Jerusalem, they had much work to do. They quickly rebuilt Jehovah’s altar and laid the foundation of the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:1-15:3:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:10-15:3:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 10</a>) But their initial enthusiasm soon waned. Why? In addition to the temple work, they had to build houses for themselves, plant fields, and feed their families. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:68-15:2:68" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 2:68,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:70-15:2:70" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 70</a>) Moreover, they faced opposition from their enemies, who plotted to stop the temple rebuilding work.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:4:1-15:4:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 4:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The returning exiles were also affected by unstable economic and political conditions. Their land was now part of the Persian Empire. After Persian King Cyrus died in 530 B.C.E., his successor, Cambyses, embarked on a military campaign to conquer Egypt. While heading for Egypt, his soldiers likely demanded food, water, and shelter from the Israelites, which caused them further hardship. The early reign of Cambyses’ successor, Darius I, was marked by revolts and political instability. These conditions no doubt caused many of the returned exiles to worry about how they would provide for their family. Because of all the uncertainty they faced, some Jews felt that it was not the right time to rebuild Jehovah’s temple.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:2-37:1:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hag. 1:2</a>.</p>

In 522 B.C.E., their enemies succeeded in having a ban placed on the rebuilding of Jehovah’s temple. But Zechariah assured the Jews that Jehovah would use His powerful spirit to remove any obstacles. In 520 B.C.E., King Darius lifted the ban on the temple work and even provided the Jews with funds and official support.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:1-15:6:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:6-15:6:10" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> By means of Haggai and Zechariah, Jehovah promised his people that they would have his backing if they gave priority to the rebuilding of the temple.

Because the Jews gave priority to doing God’s will despite uncertainties, they received Jehovah’s <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>support not only materially but also spiritually.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> In 468 B.C.E., Ezra traveled with a second group of Jews from Babylon to Jerusalem. To undertake this trip, Ezra and the returnees needed strong faith. They would be traveling on hazardous roads, carrying a great amount of gold and silver that had been donated to the temple. That made them easy targets for robbers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:12-15:7:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 7:12-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:8:31-15:8:31" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 8:31</a>) In addition, they soon realized that Jerusalem itself was not safe.

Some of them were likely limited in what they could do because of old age, serious illness, or family obligations. Even so, they willingly supported the returnees by contributing materially. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:5-15:1:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 1:5, 6</a>) It seems that some 19 years after the arrival of the first group of returnees in Jerusalem, those remaining in Babylon were still sending voluntary gifts to Jerusalem.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:6:10-38:6:10" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Zech. 6:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Even if we feel limited in what we can do in God’s service, we can rest assured that Jehovah appreciates our sincere efforts to please him. How do we know? In Zechariah’s day, Jehovah asked his prophet to make a crown out of the gold and the silver sent by the exiles in Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:6:11-38:6:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Zech. 6:11</a>) This “grand crown” would serve as a “reminder” of their generous contributions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:6:14-38:6:14" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Zech. 6:14</a>, ftns.) We can be confident that Jehovah will never forget our earnest efforts to serve him during uncertain times.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"><strong>21.</strong> What will help us to face the future with confidence?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> We will no doubt continue to face uncertainties in these last days, and conditions may even get worse in the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:13-55:3:13" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 13</a>) However, we do not need to be consumed by anxiety. Remember Jehovah’s words to his people in Haggai’s day: “I am with you . . . Do not be afraid.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:4-37:2:5" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Hag. 2:4, 5</a>) We too can be sure that Jehovah will be with us as long as we do our best to carry out his will. By applying the lessons we have learned from the prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah and the example of Ezra, we will maintain our confidence in Jehovah no matter what uncertainties we may experience in the future.</p>
