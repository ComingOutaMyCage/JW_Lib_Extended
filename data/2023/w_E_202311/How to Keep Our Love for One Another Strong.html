<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>1-2.</strong> (a) Why could the apostle Paul say that love is “the greatest” quality? (b) What questions will we consider?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHEN the apostle Paul was discussing faith, hope, and love, he concluded by saying that “the greatest of these [qualities] is love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:13-46:13:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:13</a>) Why could Paul say this? In the future, we will no longer need to have faith in God’s promises about his new world or hope that those promises will be fulfilled because they will already be realized. But we will always need to have love for Jehovah and for people. In fact, our love for them will keep growing forever.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Since we will always need to have love, we will consider three questions.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What reasons do we have for loving one another?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Why is it important for us to love one another? Among other reasons, love identifies us as true Christians. Jesus told his apostles: “By this all will know that you are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Further, having love for one another keeps us united. Paul called love “a perfect bond of union.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:14-51:3:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Col. 3:14</a>) There is, however, still another important reason why we should love one another. The <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>apostle John wrote to fellow believers: “Whoever loves God must also love his brother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:21-62:4:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 4:21</a>) When we show love for one another, we show our love for God.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>4-5.</strong> Illustrate how our love for God is connected to our love for one another.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> In what way is our love for God closely connected to the love we show for our brothers and sisters? To illustrate, consider the connection that exists between our heart and other parts of our body. When a physician checks our pulse on our wrist to see if it is weak or strong, he may be able to get some information about the condition of our heart. How could we apply this principle to the topic of love?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Just as a doctor is able to get some information about the health of our heart when checking our pulse, we can get some information about the strength of our love for God by checking our love for others. If we notice that our love for fellow believers has weakened somewhat, this may indicate that our love for God is also growing weak. But when we regularly show love for fellow believers, this signals that our love for God is strong.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> Why should we be concerned if our love for our brothers and sisters is weakening? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:7-62:4:9" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 John 4:7-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:11-62:4:11" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 11</a>)</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> We should be concerned if our love for our brothers and sisters is growing weak. Why? Because it would mean that we are in spiritual danger. The apostle John makes that clear when he reminds us: “The one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:20-62:4:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 4:20</a>) What is the lesson for us? Jehovah is pleased with us only if we “love one another.”​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:7-62:4:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 4:7-9,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:11-62:4:11" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> <strong>11</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Again and again in God’s Word, we find the command to “love one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:12-43:15:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 15:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:17-43:15:17" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:8-45:13:8" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Rom. 13:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:9-52:4:9" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 1 Thess. 4:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:22-60:1:22" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:11-62:4:11" data-bid="8-6" class="b"> 1 John 4:11</a>) However, love is a quality of the heart, or the inner person, and no human can see into our heart. So, then, how can we make our love for one another visible? By our words and actions.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> There are various ways in which we can show our brothers and sisters that we love them.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> Why is giving comfort to others an important expression of our love? (See also picture.)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Let us consider one of the expressions of our love mentioned in the preceding paragraph. We will examine Paul’s admonition: “Keep comforting one another.” Why is giving comfort to others an important expression of <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>our love? According to a Bible reference work, the word that Paul used for “comfort” means “standing beside a person to encourage him when he is undergoing severe testing.” Thus, by giving comfort, we help a fellow believer who is in distress to get up and to continue walking on the road to life. Each time we offer a brother or a sister a shoulder to cry on, we express our love for our fellow believer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:6-47:7:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:13-47:7:13" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> What is the connection between compassion and comfort?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Feeling compassion and giving comfort are closely related. In what way? A compassionate person is moved to comfort others and to try to relieve their suffering. So first we feel compassion; then we give comfort. Note how Paul connects Jehovah’s compassion to the comfort He gives. Paul describes Jehovah as “the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3</a>) As a <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070151/1:3">study note</a> on this verse explains, Paul uses the expression “tender mercies” to describe a feeling of compassion for others. Thus, “God is called the Father, or the Source, of tender mercies because compassion emanates from him.” And that compassion moves him to comfort “us in all our trials.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:4-47:1:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:4</a>) Just as pure water flowing from a spring brings refreshment to those who are thirsty, Jehovah brings refreshment and comfort to those who are distressed. How can we imitate Jehovah in feeling compassion and in providing comfort to others? One way we can do so is by cultivating qualities in our heart that are related to giving comfort. What are some of these qualities?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Colossians 3:12 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:8</a>, what other qualities must we cultivate to maintain the love that moves us to comfort others?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> What will help us to maintain the love that we need in order to <strong><em>“keep</em></strong> comforting one another” from day to day? We need to cultivate such tender qualities as fellow feeling, brotherly affection, and kindness. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Colossians 3:12;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> <strong>1 Peter 3:8</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> How will these qualities help us? When feelings of compassion and related qualities become part of our personality, we cannot help but give comfort to those in distress. As Jesus stated, “out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:34-40:12:35" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 12:34, 35</a>) Giving comfort to our brothers and sisters in need is truly an important way in which we express our love to them.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> (a) Why do we need to remain alert? (b) What question will we now consider?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> We all want to “continue loving one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:7-62:4:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 John 4:7</a>) However, it is important for us to remember that Jesus warned that “the love of the greater number [would] grow cold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 24:12</a>) Jesus was not saying that this would occur on a large scale among his disciples. Nonetheless, we should remain alert so that we are not influenced by the lack of love in the world around us. With that thought in mind, let us consider this important question: Is there a way to test whether our love for our brothers is strong?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong> What can put our love to the test?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> One way to determine the strength of our love is to examine how we handle certain situations in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:8-47:8:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:8</a>) One such situation is mentioned by the apostle Peter: “Above all things, have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:8</a>) So the weaknesses and imperfections of others can put our love to the test.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong> According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:8</a>, what type of love do we need? Illustrate.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Let us take a closer look at Peter’s words. The first part of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="27-1" class="b">verse 8</a> describes the type of love we need to have​—“intense love.” The word Peter used for “intense” literally means “stretched out.” The second part of the verse describes the effect that intense love can have. It covers the sins of our brothers. We could picture it this way: We grasp our love with both hands, as if it were an extendable piece of fabric, and stretch it out more and more until it covers, not one, not two, but “a multitude of sins.” To cover is a descriptive way of saying to forgive. Just as a piece <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>of fabric can cover a stain, love can cover the weaknesses and imperfections of others.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>15.</strong> If our love for our brothers and sisters is strong enough, what will we be able to do? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Colossians 3:13</a>)</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Our love for others should be strong enough that we can forgive the imperfections of our fellow believers​—even if that requires considerable effort at times. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Colossians 3:13</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> When we succeed in forgiving others, we show that our love is strong and that we want to please Jehovah.
