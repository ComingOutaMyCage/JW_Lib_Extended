(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>) Although we do not know just when that new world will become a reality, the evidence indicates that we do not have much longer to wait.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:32-40:24:34" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 24:32-34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:7-44:1:7" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Acts 1:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What will we discuss in this article?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> In this article, we will discuss three ways that we can strengthen our faith in Jehovah’s promise of a new world: (1) by meditating on the ransom, (2) by contemplating Jehovah’s power, and (3) by spending time in spiritual activities. Then we will discuss how Jehovah’s message to Habakkuk strengthens our faith today. First, though, let us consider some situations we may be facing right now that require strong faith in the promise of a coming new world.</p>
<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span><strong>SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE STRONG FAITH</strong></h2>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> What decisions require strong faith?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Every day, we make decisions that require strong faith. For example, we make decisions involving our associations, entertainment, education, marriage, children, and secular work. We do well to ask ourselves: ‘Do my choices show that I am certain that this system is temporary and will soon be replaced by God’s new world? Or are my choices influenced by people who live as if death were the end of everything?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 6:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:16-42:12:21" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 12:16-21</a>) We will make the best decisions if we strengthen our faith that the new world is close at hand.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>5-6.</strong> Why do we need strong faith in times of distress? Illustrate.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> We also face trials that require strong faith. We may face persecution, chronic illness, or other things that can cause us to become discouraged. At first, we might meet our trial with determination. But if it drags on​—as trials often do—​we will need strong faith in order to endure and to continue serving Jehovah with joy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 12:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:6-60:1:7" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> When undergoing a trial, we may feel that Jehovah’s new world will never come. Does this mean that our faith is weak? Not necessarily. Consider an illustration. In the middle of a brutally cold winter, we may feel that summer will never come. And yet summer does come. Likewise, when we are deeply discouraged, we might <strong><em>feel</em></strong> that the new world will never come. If our faith is strong, though, we <strong><em>know</em></strong> that God’s promises will be fulfilled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:3-19:94:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 94:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:14-19:94:15" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:17-58:6:19" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Heb. 6:17-19</a>) With that confidence, we can continue putting our worship of Jehovah first in our life.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What attitude must we guard against?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Consider one more area in which strong faith is required​—the preaching work. Many people to whom we preach feel that the “good news” about God’s coming new world is too good to be true. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:32-26:33:32" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ezek. 33:32</a>) We never want to allow their skeptical attitude to rub off on us. To prevent that from happening, we must keep strengthening our faith. Let us consider three ways we can do that.</p>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>MEDITATE ON THE RANSOM</strong></h2>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>8-9.</strong> How can meditating on the ransom affect our faith?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> One way we can strengthen our faith is by meditating on the ransom. The ransom is a guarantee that God’s promises will come true. When we carefully reflect on why the ransom was provided and what it involved, we strengthen our faith that God’s promise of endless life in a better world is sure to be fulfilled. Why can we say that?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Well, what did the ransom involve? Jehovah sent his beloved firstborn Son, his closest companion, from heaven to be born as a perfect human. While on earth, Jesus endured all kinds of hardships. Then he suffered and died a painful death. What a high price Jehovah paid! Our loving God would never have allowed his Son to suffer and die just to provide a better but very brief life for <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:18-60:1:19" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:18, 19</a>) Having paid so high a price, Jehovah will see to it that unending life in the new world becomes a reality.</p>
<h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>CONTEMPLATE JEHOVAH’S POWER</strong></h2>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:20-49:3:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:20</a>, what is Jehovah able to do?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> A second way to strengthen our faith is by contemplating Jehovah’s power. He has the power to fulfill everything he promises to do. True, the fulfillment of the promise of unending life in a new world may seem impossible to humans. But Jehovah frequently promises things that humans could never accomplish. He is, after all, Almighty God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:2-18:42:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 42:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:27-41:10:27" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Mark 10:27</a>) Would we expect him to make ordinary promises?​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:20-49:3:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 3:20</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> Give an example of one of God’s extraordinary promises. (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2023366/57-93">Some Extraordinary Promises Fulfilled</a>.”)</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Consider some of the seemingly impossible things that Jehovah promised his people in the past. He assured Abraham and Sarah that they would have a son in their old age. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:15-1:17:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 17:15-17</a>) He also told Abraham that his descendants would be given the land of Canaan. During the many years that Abraham’s descendants, the Israelites, were slaves in Egypt, it must have seemed as if that promise would never come true. But it did. Later, Jehovah announced that elderly Elizabeth would have a child. He also told Mary, a virgin, that she would give birth to his own Son, whose arrival Jehovah had promised thousands of years earlier in the garden of Eden​—another promise fulfilled!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Consider another spiritual activity that strengthens our faith: <strong><em>personal study.</em></strong> Susan finds it helpful to schedule her study sessions. She says: “On Sunday, I study for the next week’s <em>Watchtower</em> Study. On Monday and Tuesday, I prepare for the midweek meeting. On the remaining days, I work on a personal study project.” By maintaining a consistent schedule for study, Susan continually builds her faith. Irene, who has served for decades at world headquarters, has found it faith-strengthening to study Bible prophecy. She says: “I find it amazing that Jehovah’s prophecies are fulfilled to the smallest detail.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<h2 id="p25" data-pid="25"><strong>“IT WILL WITHOUT FAIL COME TRUE”</strong></h2>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>16.</strong> Why does Jehovah’s assurance to Habakkuk have meaning for us today? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:36-58:10:37" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:36, 37</a>)</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Some of Jehovah’s servants have been waiting for the end of this system of things for a long time. From a human standpoint, the fulfillment of God’s promise might seem to be delaying. Jehovah addressed that concern when he assured the prophet Habakkuk: “The vision is yet for its appointed time, and it is rushing toward its end, and it will not lie. Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it! For it will without fail come true. It will not be late!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hab. <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>2:3</a>) Did God provide that assurance for the benefit of Habakkuk only? Or do His words have meaning for us today? Under inspiration, the apostle Paul applied those words to Christians, who are in expectation of the new world. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:36-58:10:37" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 10:36, 37</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Yes, we can be sure that even if our promised deliverance seems to delay, “it will without fail come true. It will not be late!”</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>17.</strong> How did one sister apply the counsel Jehovah gave to Habakkuk?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Many servants of Jehovah have applied Jehovah’s counsel to “keep in expectation”​—even for decades. Louise, for example, began serving Jehovah in 1939. She says: “At that time, I thought Armageddon would come before I finished high school. That didn’t happen. Over the years, I found it helpful to read what I call ‘the waiting accounts’​—the Bible narratives of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, and others who had to wait a long time before receiving the promised reward from Jehovah. Remaining in expectation has kept me and others focused on the certainty of the nearness of the new world.” Many other longtime worshippers of Jehovah agree!</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"><strong>18.</strong> How can observing creation strengthen our faith in the coming new world?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> True, the new world is not yet here. Note, however, some of the things that are here​—the stars, the trees, the animals, and your fellow humans. No one would doubt that all these things are real, even though there was a time when they did not exist. They are now here only because Jehovah created them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:27" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 26, 27</a>) Our God has also purposed to establish a new world. He will fulfill that purpose. In the new world, people will enjoy endless life in perfect health. At God’s appointed time, the new world will become as real as the universe around us today.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isa. 65:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:3, 4</a>.</p>
