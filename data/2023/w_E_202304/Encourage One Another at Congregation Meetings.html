<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong> Why do we comment at meetings?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHY do we attend congregation meetings? Primarily, to praise Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:12-19:26:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 26:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:1-19:111:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 111:1</a>) We also attend meetings so that we can encourage one another during these difficult times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:11</a>) When we raise our hand and give a comment, we contribute toward both of these objectives.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong> What opportunities do we have to comment at our meetings?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Each week, we have opportunities to comment at our meetings. For example, on the weekends, we can participate during the congregation <em>Watchtower</em> Study. At our midweek meetings, we may comment during the Spiritual Gems, the Congregation Bible Study, and other discussion parts.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What challenges might we face, and how can <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a> help?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> We all want to praise Jehovah and encourage our fellow worshippers. But when commenting, we may face challenges. We may feel anxious about commenting, or we may keenly desire to participate but are not called on as often as we would like. How can we deal with these challenges? We find a key to the answer in the apostle Paul’s letter to the Hebrews. When discussing the importance of meeting together, he said that we should focus on “encouraging one another.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 10:24, 25</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> When we realize that others in the audience can be encouraged by even a simple expression of our faith, we <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>will feel better about volunteering to comment. And if we are not called on often, we can be happy that others in the congregation will have the opportunity to comment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> What three points will be discussed in this article?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> In this article, we will first discuss how we can encourage one another in a <strong><em>small congregation</em></strong> where the number of commenters is limited. Then, we will examine how to encourage one another in a <strong><em>large congregation</em></strong> where many raise their hand to comment. Finally, we will discuss ways that we can make the <strong><em>content</em></strong> of our comments genuinely encouraging to others.</p>

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER IN A SMALL CONGREGATION</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> How can we encourage one another if few are in attendance?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In a small congregation or group, there are not as many commenters for the conductor to choose from. At times, he may need to wait awhile before someone volunteers to comment. The meeting may seem to drag on​—which is hardly encouraging. What can you do? Be willing to raise your hand frequently. By doing so, you may motivate others to participate more often.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>6-7.</strong> How might we reduce any anxiety we have about commenting?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> What if the very thought of commenting makes you nervous? Many can relate to that feeling. Yet, in order to be of greater encouragement to your brothers and sisters, why not explore ways to reduce your anxiety about commenting? How might you do that?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> You may find it helpful to review some of the suggestions published in previous issues of <em>The Watchtower.</em><span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> For example, prepare well. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5</a>) The more familiar you are with the material, the more at ease you will feel about volunteering to comment. Also, make your comments brief. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:23-20:15:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 15:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:27-20:17:27" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 17:27</a>) A short answer gives you less to worry about. A brief comment, perhaps consisting of just one or two sentences, may even be easier for your brothers and sisters to understand than a lengthy comment that develops many ideas. By making a brief comment in your own words, you will show that you have prepared well and that you have a clear understanding of the material.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How does Jehovah view our best efforts?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> What if you try some of these suggestions but still feel too anxious to comment more than once or twice? Be assured that Jehovah will appreciate your sincere efforts to do what you can. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:1-42:21:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 21:1-4</a>) Giving your best does not mean putting an unbearable strain on yourself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:5-50:4:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 4:5</a>) Determine what you can do, set a goal to do it, and pray for a calm heart. Initially, that goal may be to make one brief comment.</p>

<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER IN A LARGE CONGREGATION</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What challenge might arise in large congregations?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> If your congregation has many publishers, you may have a different challenge. Perhaps so many brothers and <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>sisters volunteer to comment that your hand is frequently overlooked. Danielle, for example, has always enjoyed commenting at meetings.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> She views it as part of her worship, a way to encourage others, and a means of reinforcing Bible truths in her own mind. But when she moved to a larger congregation, she was called on less frequently​—sometimes not even once during an entire meeting. “I was frustrated,” she said. “I felt as if I had missed out on a privilege. When it happens again and again, you begin to wonder if it’s deliberate.”</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> How might we increase our chances of giving a comment?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Can you relate to Danielle’s feelings? If so, you might be tempted to give up and just listen to the meeting. But do not stop trying to comment. What can you do? You may find it helpful to prepare several comments for each meeting. Then if you are not chosen to comment early in the study, you will still have opportunities to comment as the meeting progresses. When preparing for the <em>Watchtower</em> Study, think about how each paragraph ties in to the theme of the article. If you do, you will likely have something to offer throughout the lesson. Additionally, you might prepare to comment on paragraphs that discuss deeper truths that are more difficult to explain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:10-46:2:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:10</a>) Why? Because there may be fewer volunteers during that part of the lesson. What if, despite applying these suggestions, you find that after several meetings you still have not had an opportunity to comment? You might approach the conductor before the meeting and tell him which question you would like to answer.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> What does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Philippians 2:4</a> encourage us to do?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 2:4</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Under inspiration, the apostle Paul encouraged Christians to look out for the interests of others. How can we apply that counsel during meetings? By remembering that others, like us, want to participate.</p>

When you are having a conversation with your friends, would you talk so much that they have little opportunity to speak? Of course not! You want them to share in the conversation. Similarly, at meetings, we want to allow as many as possible to comment. In fact, one of the best ways to encourage our brothers and sisters is by giving them a chance to express their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:24</a>) Let us consider how we can do that.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong> How can we allow more in the audience to share in commenting?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> For one thing, we can <strong><em>keep our comments brief,</em></strong> thus allowing time for more to participate. Elders and other experienced publishers can set the example. Even when you give a short comment, <strong><em>avoid talking about too many points.</em></strong> If you cover everything in the paragraph, there will be little left for others to say. In this paragraph, for example, two suggestions are given​—keep comments brief and avoid covering too many points. If you are called on first to comment on this paragraph, why not talk about just one of these points?</p>
