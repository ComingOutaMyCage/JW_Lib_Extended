<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>PICTURE the scene in late 29 C.E. at the start of Jesus’ ministry. Jesus and his mother, Mary, and some of his disciples are invited to a wedding feast in Cana, a village north of Jesus’ hometown of Nazareth. Mary is a friend of the family and is apparently helping to care for the guests. But during the wedding feast, a problem arises that could greatly embarrass the family and the young couple​—the wine runs out.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Perhaps the number of guests is greater than expected. Mary quickly turns to her son and says: “They have no wine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:1-43:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 2:1-3</a>) What does Jesus do? Something extraordinary​—he miraculously turns water into “fine wine.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:9-43:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 2:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>2-3.</strong> (a) How did Jesus use his miraculous power? (b) How can we benefit from considering Jesus’ miracles?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jesus would go on to perform many other miracles during his ministry.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> He used his miraculous power to help tens of thousands of people. For example, just two of his miracles​—feeding 5,000 men and later 4,000 men—​may have involved a total of over 27,000 people if we include the women and children who were also present. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:15-40:14:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 14:15-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:32-40:15:38" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 15:32-38</a>) On both occasions, Jesus also healed many who were sick.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> Jesus’ miracles teach us faith-strengthening lessons about whom?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The miracles of Jesus teach us faith-strengthening lessons not only about him but also about his Father. After all, Jehovah was the real Source of the miracles. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:38-44:10:38" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 10:38</a> tells us: “God anointed him [Jesus] with holy spirit and power, and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil, because God was with him.” Remember, too, that in all that Jesus said and did​—including the miracles he performed—​he perfectly reflected his Father’s thinking and feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) Consider three lessons we can learn from Jesus’ miracles.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What moved Jesus to perform miracles? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:30-40:20:34" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matthew 20:30-34</a>)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>First, Jesus and his Father deeply love us.</em></strong> While on earth, Jesus showed the depth of his love for people by using his miraculous power to ease their suffering. On one occasion, two blind men cried out to him for help. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:30-40:20:34" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 20:30-34</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Notice that Jesus was “moved with pity” and then he healed them. As used here, the Greek verb translated “moved with pity” refers to an intense compassion felt deep inside the body. Such deep compassion, which is an expression of love, also moved Jesus to feed the hungry and to cure a leper. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:32-40:15:32" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 15:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:41-41:1:41" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Mark 1:41</a>) We can be sure that Jehovah, the God of “tender compassion,” and his Son deeply love us and are pained by our suffering.

For example, he has the power to free us from the root cause of mankind’s problems​—inherited sin and its effects, sickness and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:1-40:9:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 9:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:18-45:5:19" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 18, 19</a>) His miraculous works proved that he can cure “every sort of” sickness and even resurrect the dead.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> When performing miracles, Jesus showed great humility and compassion​—qualities that we do well to imitate. Let us consider two examples, starting with the account of the wedding feast in Cana.</p>

<div id="section3" class="section">
<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>A LESSON IN HUMILITY</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What did Jesus do at the wedding feast? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:6-43:2:10" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 2:6-10</a>)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:6-43:2:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>John 2:6-10</strong></a><strong>.</strong> When the wine ran out at the wedding feast, was Jesus obligated to do anything? No. There was no prophecy foretelling that the Messiah would miraculously produce wine. But just imagine how you would feel if the beverages ran out at your own wedding. Jesus likely felt compassion for the family, especially the bride and groom, and wanted to spare them embarrassment. <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>So, as mentioned at the outset, he performed a miracle. He turned water​—some 390 liters (103 gal)—​into the finest wine. Perhaps he provided such a generous amount so that some would be left over for future use or could even be sold to help the young couple financially. How relieved the newly married couple must have been!</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Consider some meaningful details in the account recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:1-43:2:25" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John chapter 2</a>. Did you notice that Jesus did not fill the stone jars with water? Rather than draw attention to himself, he told the servants to fill the jars. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:6-43:2:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Verses 6, 7</a>) And after he turned the water into wine, Jesus did not personally take some of the wine to the director of the feast. Instead, he told the servants to do that. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:8-43:2:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Verse 8</a>) Jesus certainly did not take a cup of the wine, hold it up in front of the guests, and boast, ‘Taste some of the wine that I just made!’</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> What can we learn from Jesus’ miracle?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> What can we learn from Jesus’ miracle of turning water into wine? We learn a lesson in humility. Jesus did not boast about the miracle; in fact, he <strong><em>never</em></strong> boasted about his accomplishments. On the contrary, he humbly and repeatedly gave all glory and credit to his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:19-43:5:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 5:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:30-43:5:30" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:28-43:8:28" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 8:28</a>) If we imitate Jesus by keeping a humble view of ourselves, we will not boast about our achievements. No matter what we may do in Jehovah’s service, let us boast, not about ourselves, but about the wonderful God we are privileged to serve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:9:23-24:9:24" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jer. 9:23, 24</a>) Let us give him due credit. After all, what good could we possibly accomplish without Jehovah’s help?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:26-46:1:31" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:26-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> What is another way we can imitate Jesus’ humility? Illustrate.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Consider another way we can imitate Jesus’ humility. Imagine this scenario: An elder spends much time helping a young ministerial servant prepare for his first public talk. As a result, the young brother gives an encouraging talk, to the delight of the congregation. After the meeting, someone comes up to the elder and says: ‘Brother So-and-so gave an excellent talk, didn’t he?’ Does the elder need to say: ‘Yes, but I spent a lot of time helping him’? Or might he humbly say: ‘Yes, he did. I’m so proud of him’? When we are humble, we do not have to take credit for the good things we do for others. We are content with knowing that Jehovah sees and values what we do. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:2-40:6:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 6:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:16-58:13:16" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:16</a>) Surely, we please Jehovah when we imitate Jesus in showing humility.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:6-60:5:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:6</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:32-12:4:37" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Ki. 4:32-37</a>) As Jesus approaches the gate, he sees a funeral procession leaving the city. The scene <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>is especially sad​—a widow has lost her only child.

Jesus did not just <strong><em>feel</em></strong> pity for the mother; he <strong><em>showed</em></strong> his compassion for her. He spoke to her, no doubt with a reassuring tone, and said: “Stop weeping.” Then he took the initiative to do something.

The mother later recalled: “I felt so full of love for the brothers and sisters.” She was very grateful that she had gone to the meeting. “That’s where our help is,” she said, “there at the Kingdom Hall.” We can be sure that Jehovah notices and values even the simple things we do to show compassion to bereaved ones, who are “crushed in spirit.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 34:18</a>.</p>
