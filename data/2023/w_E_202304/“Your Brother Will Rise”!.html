You can wait for me; it will be OK.” Can you imagine how those parents must have felt when they learned how real the resurrection hope is to their son?</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>WHY WE CAN BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION PROMISE</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> To believe in a promise, of what must we be convinced? Illustrate.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> To believe in a promise, we must be convinced that the one making the promise has the <strong><em>desire</em></strong> as well as the <strong><em>power,</em></strong> or ability, to fulfill it. To illustrate: Imagine that your house has been badly damaged by a storm. A friend comes to you and promises, ‘I am going to help you rebuild your house.’ He is sincere, and you are convinced that he has the desire to help you. If he is a skilled builder and has the needed tools, you know that he also has the ability. So you believe in his promise. What, then, about God’s promise of a resurrection? Does he really have the desire and the power to fulfill it?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>5-6.</strong> Why can we be sure that Jehovah has the <strong><em>desire</em></strong> to resurrect the dead?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Does Jehovah have the <strong><em>desire</em></strong> to resurrect the dead? Without question, he does. He inspired a number of Bible writers to record his promise of a future resurrection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:19-23:26:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 26:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:14-28:13:14" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Hos. 13:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:11-66:20:13" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Rev. 20:11-13</a>) And when Jehovah makes a promise, he always fulfills it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>) Jehovah is, in fact, eager to restore the dead to life. Why can we say that?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider the words of the patriarch Job. He was sure that even if he died, Jehovah would yearn to see him live again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:14-18:14:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>, ftn.) Jehovah has the same longing for all his worshippers who have died. He is eager to bring them back to life, healthy and happy. What about the billions who have died without having a chance to learn the truth about Jehovah? Our loving God wants to resurrect them too. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) He wants them to have the opportunity to become his friends and live forever on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Clearly, Jehovah has the desire to resurrect the dead.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>7-8.</strong> Why can we be sure that Jehovah has the <strong><em>power</em></strong> to resurrect the dead?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Does Jehovah also have the <strong><em>power</em></strong> to resurrect the dead? Absolutely! He is “the Almighty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:8-66:1:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 1:8</a>) So he is powerful enough to defeat any enemy, even death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:26</a>) We find strength and comfort in knowing that. Consider the experience of Sister Emma Arnold. She and her family faced severe tests of faith during World War II. To comfort her daughter over the loss of loved ones in Nazi concentration camps, Emma said: “If death would keep mankind perpetually in its bonds, it would be stronger than God, wouldn’t it?” Surely, nothing is stronger than Jehovah! The almighty God who <strong><em>created</em></strong> life is capable of <strong><em>restoring</em></strong> life to those who have died.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Another reason why we know that God is capable of resurrecting the dead is that he has a limitless memory. He calls each star by its name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) Also, he remembers those who have died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:13-18:14:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 14:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:37-42:20:38" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Luke 20:37, 38</a>) He can easily remember the smallest details about those he will resurrect, including their genetic code, their experiences in life, and their memories.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> Why do you believe in Jehovah’s promise of a future resurrection?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Clearly, we can believe in Jehovah’s promise of a future resurrection because we know that he has both the desire and the power to fulfill it. Consider another reason for believing in God’s promise of a resurrection: Jehovah has already done it. In Bible times, he empowered a handful of faithful men, including Jesus, to raise the dead. Let us examine the account of one of the resurrections performed by Jesus, as recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:1-43:11:57" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John chapter 11</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>JESUS LOSES A DEAR FRIEND</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> What happens while Jesus is preaching across the Jordan from Bethany, and what does he do? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:1-43:11:3" data-bid="36-1" class="b">John 11:1-3</a>)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:1-43:11:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>John 11:1-3</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Imagine the scene in Bethany toward the end of 32 C.E. Jesus has close friends in this village​—Lazarus and his two sisters, Mary and Martha. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:38-42:10:42" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 10:38-42</a>) But Lazarus has become ill, and his sisters are worried. They send a message to Jesus, who is across the Jordan, about a two-day walk from Bethany. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:40-43:10:40" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 10:40</a>) Sadly, Lazarus dies about the time the messenger reaches Jesus. Even though Jesus knows that his friend has just died, he remains where he is for two more days and then he makes the trip to Bethany. So by the time Jesus arrives, Lazarus has been dead for four days. Jesus intends to do something that will benefit his friends and glorify God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:4-43:11:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 11:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:6-43:11:6" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:11" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:17-43:11:17" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> What lesson about friendship can we learn from this account?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> We learn a lesson about friendship from this account. Consider: When Mary and Martha sent the message to Jesus, they did not ask him to come to Bethany. They simply said that his dear friend was sick. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:3-43:11:3" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 11:3</a>) When Lazarus died, Jesus could have resurrected him from a distance. Yet, Jesus chose to go to Bethany to be with his friends Mary and Martha. Do you have a friend who will come to your aid without being asked? Then you know that you can count on him for help in “times of distress.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 17:17</a>) Like Jesus, may we be such a friend to others! Now let us return to the account and see what happens next.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> What does Jesus promise Martha, and why is it not an empty promise? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:23-43:11:26" data-bid="37-1" class="b">John 11:23-26</a>)</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:23-43:11:26" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>John 11:23-26</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Martha learns that Jesus is near Bethany. She rushes out to meet him and says: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:21-43:11:21" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 11:21</a>) True, he could have healed Lazarus. But Jesus has in mind doing something even more remarkable. He promises: “Your brother will rise.” He also gives Martha further reason for believing in his promise, saying: “I am the resurrection and the life.” Yes, he has God-given power over life <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>and death. Earlier, he raised a young girl shortly after her death and he also raised a young man, apparently on the day the man died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:11-42:7:15" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 7:11-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:49-42:8:55" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 8:49-55</a>) But can he resurrect someone who has been dead for four days and whose body has begun to decay?</p>

Mary, Lazarus’ other sister, goes out to meet Jesus. She repeats what her sister said: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” She and others with her are grief-stricken. Seeing and hearing them weeping, Jesus is deeply saddened. Moved by tender compassion for his friends, he gives way to tears. He understands how painful it is when a loved one dies. Surely, he is eager to remove the cause of their tears!</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong> What can we learn about Jehovah from Jesus’ reaction to Mary’s weeping?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Jesus’ reaction to Mary’s weeping teaches us that Jehovah is a God of tender compassion.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:45-43:12:45" data-bid="27-1" class="b">John 12:45</a>) So when we read that Jesus felt such deep compassion for his grieving friends that he wept, we may conclude that Jehovah too is deeply moved by our tears of sorrow.
