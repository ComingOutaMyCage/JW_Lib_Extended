<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>God created humans to engage in sex only within the arrangement of marriage between a male and a female. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:​27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:22-3:18:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Leviticus 18:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:18-20:5:19" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Proverbs 5:​18, 19</a>) The Bible condemns sexual activity that is not between a husband and wife, whether it is homosexual or heterosexual conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:​18</a>) This includes intercourse, fondling another person’s genitals, and engaging in oral or anal sex.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>While the Bible disapproves of homosexual acts, it does not condone hatred of homosexuals or homophobia. Instead, Christians are directed to “respect everyone.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:​17</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Can a person be born homosexual?</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="5" class="p5 sn"> The Bible doesn’t comment directly on the biology of homosexual desires, though it acknowledges that we are all born with a tendency to go against what God commands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 7:​21-​25</a>) Rather than focus on the cause of homosexual desires, however, the Bible prohibits homosexual acts.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>How to please God despite having same-sex urges.</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="6" class="p6 sn"> The Bible says: “Don’t be controlled by your body. Kill every desire for the wrong kind of sex.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version</em>) To kill wrong desires, which lead to wrong actions, you need to control your thinking. If you regularly fill your mind with wholesome thoughts, you can more readily dismiss wrong desires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> James 1:​14, 15</a>) While you may struggle greatly at first, it can become easier. God promises to help you to “be made new in the force actuating your mind.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:22-49:4:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:​22-​24</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The same struggle is faced by millions with <em>heterosexual</em> desires who wish to conform to the Bible’s standards. For example, those who are single with little prospect of marriage or who are married to a partner who is unable to function sexually choose to control their sexual urges despite any temptations they might face. They are able to live happily, and those with same-sex urges can do so as well if they truly want to please God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>.</p>
