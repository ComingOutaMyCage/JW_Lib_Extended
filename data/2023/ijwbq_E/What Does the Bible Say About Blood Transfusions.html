<div class="bodyTxt">
<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible commands that we not ingest blood. So we should not accept whole blood or its primary components in any form, whether offered as food or as a transfusion. Note the following scriptures:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 9:4</strong></a><strong>.</strong> God allowed Noah and his family to add animal flesh to their diet after the Flood but commanded them not to eat the blood. God told Noah: “Only flesh with its soul—its blood—you must not eat.” This command applies to all mankind from that time on because all are descendants of Noah.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:14-3:17:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Leviticus 17:14</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “You must not eat the blood of any sort of flesh, because the soul of every sort of flesh is its blood. Anyone eating it will be cut off.” God viewed the soul, or life, as being in the blood and belonging to him. Although this law was given only to the nation of Israel, it shows how seriously God viewed the law against eating blood.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:20-44:15:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 15:20</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “Abstain . . . from blood.” God gave Christians the same command that he had given to Noah. History shows that early Christians refused to consume whole blood or even to use it for medical reasons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Why does God command us to abstain from blood?</strong></h3>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>There are sound medical reasons to avoid blood transfusions. More important, though, God commands that we abstain from blood because what it represents is sacred to him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:11-3:17:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Leviticus 17:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:20-51:1:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:20</a>.</p>
