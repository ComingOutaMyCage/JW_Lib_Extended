<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Peace on earth will come, not by human efforts, but by means of God’s Kingdom, a heavenly government ruled by Christ Jesus. Notice how the Bible teaches us about this wonderful hope.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>             God will make “wars to cease to the extremity of the earth,” fulfilling his promise to bring “<strong>peace on earth</strong> to those with whom he is pleased!”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:9-19:46:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 46:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:14-42:2:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 2:14</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>             God’s Kingdom will rule from heaven over the entire earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:14-27:7:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 7:14</a>) As a world government, it will eliminate nationalism, which is at the root of many conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>             Jesus, the Ruler of God’s Kingdom, is called the “Prince of Peace,” and he will ensure that “to peace there will be no end.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>             People determined to keep fighting will not be allowed to live under the Kingdom, since “anyone loving violence [God’s] soul certainly hates.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:5-19:11:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:22-20:2:22" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Proverbs 2:22</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>              God teaches his subjects how to live in peace. Describing the results of this instruction, the Bible says: “They will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:3-23:2:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:3, 4</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Already, millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world are learning from God how to be peaceable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:9-40:5:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 5:9</a>)  Although we belong to many different ethnic groups and live in over 230 different lands, we refuse to take up arms against our fellow man.</p>
