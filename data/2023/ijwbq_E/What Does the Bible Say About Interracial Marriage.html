<div class="bodyTxt">
<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>God approves of marriage between a man and a woman of different races because all races are equal in his sight. The Bible says: “God treats everyone on the same basis . . . , no matter what race.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>, <em>Good News Translation</em>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Consider some other Bible principles that bear on racial equality and marriage.</p>
<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>All races come from a common source</strong></h2>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>All humans descended from the first man, Adam, and his wife, Eve, whom the Bible calls “the mother of everyone living.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:20-1:3:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 3:20</a>) For this reason, the Bible says of God: “He made out of one man every nation of men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 17:26</a><em>)</em> Regardless of their race, all humans are part of just one family. What, though, if racial prejudice or class distinctions are strong where you live?</p>
<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Wise people ‘consult together’</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>While interracial marriage is perfectly acceptable to God, not all people share his view. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:8-23:55:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:8, 9</a>) If you are considering marrying someone of another race, you and your prospective mate should discuss the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  How will you deal with the pressures you might face from your community or family?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  How will you help your children to deal with prejudice?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>“Consulting together” in this way can help you to make your marriage a success.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:10-20:13:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 21:5</a>.</p>
