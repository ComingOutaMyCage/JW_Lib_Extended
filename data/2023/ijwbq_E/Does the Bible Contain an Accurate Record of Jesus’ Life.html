<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible writer Luke said regarding his account of Jesus’ life: “I have traced all things from the start with accuracy.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:3-42:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 1:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Some claim that accounts of Jesus’ life as recorded in the Gospels—the writings of his contemporaries Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—were altered sometime in the fourth century.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>However, a valuable fragment of John’s Gospel was found in Egypt at the turn of the 20th century. It is now known as the Papyrus Rylands 457 (P<sup>52</sup>) and is preserved at the John Rylands Library, Manchester, England. It contains what is <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:31-43:18:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 18:31-33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:38" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 37, 38</a> in modern Bibles.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>This is the oldest known manuscript fragment of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Many scholars believe that it was written about 125 C.E., a mere quarter of a century or so after the original was written. The text of the fragment agrees nearly exactly with that in later manuscripts.</p>
