Is the Devil Real?


The Bible’s answer
Yes, the Devil is real. He is “the ruler of the world,” a spirit creature who became wicked and rebelled against God. (John 14:30; Ephesians 6:11, 12) The Bible reveals the Devil’s personality through these names and descriptions:
  Satan, which means “Resister.”—Job 1:6.

  Devil, which means “Slanderer.”—Revelation 12:9.

  Serpent, which is used in the Bible to mean “Deceiver.”—2 Corinthians 11:3.

  Tempter.—Matthew 4:3.

  Liar.—John 8:44.


Not a principle or quality of evil
Some view Satan the Devil as just a principle or quality of evil that exists inside us. However, the Bible records a conversation between God and Satan. God is perfect, so he could not have been talking to an evil part of himself. (Deuteronomy 32:4; Job 2:1-6) Likewise, Satan tempted Jesus, who is free of sin. (Matthew 4:8-10; 1 John 3:5) Thus, the Bible shows that the Devil is real and not merely a personification of evil.
Should we be surprised that many people don’t believe that the Devil is real? Not at all, for the Bible says that Satan uses deception to accomplish his aims. (2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10) One of his greatest tricks has been to blind many people to his existence.—2 Corinthians 4:4.
More misconceptions about the Devil
 Myth: Lucifer is another name for the Devil.
Fact: The Hebrew word that in some Bibles is translated “Lucifer” means “shining one.” (Isaiah 14:12) The context shows that this term refers to the dynasty, or line of kings, of Babylon, which God would humiliate for its arrogance. (Isaiah 14:4, 13-20) The expression “shining one” was used to mock the Babylonian dynasty after it was overthrown.
 Myth: Satan works for God as a “prosecuting attorney.”
Fact: The Devil is God’s enemy, not his servant. Satan the Devil opposes and falsely accuses people who serve God.​—1 Peter 5:8; Revelation 12:10.
