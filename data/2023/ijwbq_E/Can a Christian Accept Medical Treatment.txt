Can a Christian Accept Medical Treatment?


The Bible’s answer
Yes. Jesus implied that his followers could seek medical treatment when he said that “persons in health do not need a physician, but the ailing do.” (Matthew 9:12) Although the Bible is not a medical manual, it does provide principles to guide those who want to please God.
Questions to ask yourself
1. Do I understand the proposed treatment? The Bible advises that we search for reliable information rather than put “faith in every word.”—Proverbs 14:15.
2. Should I get a second or a third medical opinion? A “multitude of counselors” can be valuable, especially if your condition is serious.—Proverbs 15:22.
3. Does the treatment involve a violation of the Bible command to “abstain . . . from blood”?—Acts 15:20. 
4. Is spiritism used in the diagnosis or treatment? The Bible condemns the “practice of spiritism.” (Galatians 5:19-21) To determine if spiritism is involved, consider questions such as these:
  Does the practitioner employ spiritism?

  Is the treatment based on the belief that sickness is caused by offended gods or enemies who use witchcraft?

  Are sacrifices, incantations, or other spiritistic rituals or objects employed in preparing or using the medicine?


5. Am I becoming obsessed with my health? The Bible counsels: “Let your reasonableness become known to all men.” (Philippians 4:5) Being reasonable will help you to focus on “the more important things,” such as spiritual matters.—Philippians 1:10; Matthew 5:3.
