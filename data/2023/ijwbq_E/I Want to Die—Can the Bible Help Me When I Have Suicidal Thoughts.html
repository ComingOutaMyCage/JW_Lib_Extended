<p id="p47" data-pid="47"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong>Try this:</strong> Read Bible accounts about people who felt so discouraged that they wanted to die, and see how their life eventually changed for the better—often in ways that they could not have foreseen.

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p48" data-pid="48"><strong>Does the Bible tell us about people who wanted to die?</strong></h2>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span>Yes. The Bible tells us about some who said, in effect, “I want to die.” God did not rebuke them, but offered them help. He can do the same for you.</p>

<li><p id="p83" data-pid="83">  <strong>Listen empathetically.</strong> “Be quick to listen, slow to speak.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="37-1" class="b">James 1:19</a>) Understand that anguish or depression can drive a person to say things that are “wild talk.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:2-18:6:3" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Job 6:2, 3</a>) So if a friend says something thoughtless or unkind, don’t overreact and take offense.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p84" data-pid="84">  <strong>Speak consolingly.</strong> The Bible advises us: “Speak consolingly to those who are depressed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>) Do not minimize your friend’s feelings. Acknowledge his feelings and the reasons for them. Tell your friend how much he means to you.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p85" data-pid="85">  <strong>Urge your friend to get help.</strong> “Wisdom belongs to those who seek advice,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:10-20:13:10" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:10</a>. If your friend had a serious physical illness, you would encourage him to see a doctor. Suicidal thoughts can be a symptom of mental or emotional illness, so urge him to seek professional help. Even offer to go with him.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p86" data-pid="86">  <strong>Show love.</strong> The Bible says: “A true friend shows love at all times, and is a brother who is born for times of distress.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>) You cannot erase your friend’s problems or suicidal thoughts. But by confirming your love for him and your support, you may help him through another day—and his next day may look brighter.</p>

<div class="boxSupplement"><aside><div id="p87" data-pid="87" class="boxTtl rule"><h2><strong>What if I have attempted suicide in the past?</strong></h2></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p88" data-pid="88">Understandably, you may have feelings of guilt or shame. You may also feel that no one understands what led you to attempt suicide or the emotional anguish you may now be living with.</p>
<p id="p89" data-pid="89">The Bible acknowledges that we cannot fully understand what others feel. “The heart knows its own bitterness,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:10-20:14:10" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:38-11:8:38" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 8:38</a>) So while loved ones can offer a measure of comfort, they are somewhat limited. Be assured, however, that <strong>you are not alone.</strong></p>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90"><strong>God knows the human heart.</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:6:30-14:6:30" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 6:30</a>) Jehovah knows what may have led you to feel that suicide was the only way out. He also understands your present feelings, which, as mentioned, may include guilt or shame.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:1-19:139:1" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 139:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p91" data-pid="91">While God highly values life, he is willing to forgive those who have had suicidal thoughts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>) He knows that many who attempt suicide do not want to die—they just want to end their pain. So Jehovah can help, even if “our hearts may condemn us . . . , because God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:19-62:3:20" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 John 3:19, 20</a>) Yes, <em>for you</em> he wants to be “the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="47-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>.</p>
