<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Sin is any action, feeling, or thought that goes against God’s standards. It includes breaking God’s laws by doing what is wrong, or unrighteous, in God’s sight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:4-62:3:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 3:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:17-62:5:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5:​17</a>) The Bible also describes sins of omission​—that is, failing to do what is right.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:17-59:4:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 4:​17</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>In the Bible’s original languages, the words for sin mean “to miss a mark,” or a target. For example, a group of soldiers in ancient Israel were so adept at slinging stones that they “would not miss.” That expression, if translated literally, could read “would not sin.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:20:16-7:20:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 20:16</a>) Thus, to sin is to miss the mark of God’s perfect standards.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>As the Creator, God has the right to set standards for mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 4:​11</a>) We are accountable to him for our actions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 14:12</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Is it possible to avoid sinning completely?</strong></h3>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>No. The Bible says that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 3:​23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:46-11:8:46" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 8:​46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:20-21:7:20" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 7:​20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:8-62:1:8" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 1 John 1:8</a>) Why is that so?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The first humans, Adam and Eve, were sinless in the beginning. That is because they were created perfect, in God’s image. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 1:​27</a>) However, they lost their perfection by disobeying God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:5-1:3:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 3:​5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 17-​19</a>) When they had children, they passed on sin and imperfection as inherited defects. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 5:​12</a>) As King David of Israel said, “I was <em>born</em> guilty of error.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:5-19:51:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 51:5</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Are some sins worse than others?</strong></h3>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Yes. For example, the Bible says that the men of ancient Sodom were “wicked, gross sinners” whose sin was “very heavy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:13:13-1:13:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 13:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:20-1:18:20" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 18:20</a>) Consider three factors that determine the gravity, or weight, of sin.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>               <strong>Severity.</strong> The Bible warns us to avoid such serious sins as sexual immorality, idolatry, stealing, drunkenness, extortion, murder, and spiritism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:​9-​11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:8-66:21:8" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:8</a>) The Bible contrasts these with thoughtless, unintentional sins, for example, words or actions that hurt others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:18-20:12:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:32" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:​31, 32</a>) Nevertheless, the Bible encourages us not to minimize any sins, since they can lead to more serious violations of God’s laws.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:27-40:5:28" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 5:​27, 28</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>               <strong>Motive.</strong> Some sins are committed in ignorance of what God requires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:30-44:17:30" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 17:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:13-54:1:13" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 1:​13</a>) While not excusing such sins, the Bible distinguishes them from sins that involve willfully breaking God’s laws. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:15:30-4:15:31" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Numbers 15:30, 31</a>) Willful sins come from a “wicked heart.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:16:12-24:16:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jeremiah 16:12</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>               <strong>Frequency.</strong> The Bible also makes a distinction between a single sin and a practice of sin over an extended period. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:4-62:3:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 John 3:​4-8</a>) Those who “practice sin willfully,” even after learning how to do what is right, receive God’s adverse judgment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:26-58:10:27" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:26, 27</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Those guilty of serious sin can feel overwhelmed by the weight of their mistakes. For instance, King David wrote: “My errors loom over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too much for me to bear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:4-19:38:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 38:4</a>) Yet the Bible offers this hope: “Let the wicked man leave his way and the evil man his thoughts; let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy on him, to our God, for he will forgive in a large way.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:7-23:55:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:7</a>.</p>
