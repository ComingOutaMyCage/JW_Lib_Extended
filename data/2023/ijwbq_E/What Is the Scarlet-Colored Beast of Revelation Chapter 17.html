<h3 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Keys to identifying the scarlet-colored beast</strong></h3>
<ol><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>                <strong>A political entity.</strong> The scarlet-colored beast has “seven heads” that are said to represent “seven mountains” and “seven kings,” or ruling powers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:9-66:17:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 17:​9, 10</a>) Mountains and beasts are used in the Bible as symbols of governments.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:24-24:51:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:45" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Daniel 2:​44, 45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:17-27:7:17" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 7:​17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:23-27:7:23" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 23</a>.</p>

Both beasts have seven heads, ten horns, and blasphemous names.

Its purposes, methods, and structure closely resemble those of the League of Nations.</p>

And in 1979, Pope John Paul II expressed his hope that the UN “will ever remain the supreme forum of peace and justice.”</p></div>
