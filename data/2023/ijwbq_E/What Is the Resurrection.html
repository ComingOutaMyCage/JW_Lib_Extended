<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>In the Bible, the word translated as “resurrection” comes from the Greek <em>a·naʹsta·sis,</em> which means “raising up” or “standing up again.” A person who is resurrected is raised up from death and restored to life as the person he was before.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:12-46:15:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Although the word “resurrection” is not in the Hebrew Scriptures, often called the Old Testament, the teaching appears there. Through the prophet Hosea, for example, God promised: “From the power of the Grave I will redeem them; from death I will recover them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:14-28:13:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hosea 13:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:13-18:14:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Job 14:13-​15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:19-23:26:19" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Isaiah 26:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:2-27:12:2" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Daniel 12:​2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:13-27:12:13" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Where will people be resurrected?</strong> Some people are resurrected to life in heaven to rule as kings with Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:1-47:5:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Revelation 5:​9, 10</a>) The Bible calls this “the first resurrection” and “the earlier resurrection,” both expressions implying that there is another resurrection to follow. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:11-50:3:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Philippians 3:​11</a>) This later resurrection will be to life on earth, which the vast majority of those brought back to life will enjoy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>How are people resurrected?</strong> God grants Jesus the power to raise the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:25-43:11:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 11:25</a>) Jesus will restore “all those in the memorial tombs” to life, each one with his unique identity, personality, and memories. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 5:​28, 29</a>) Those resurrected to heaven receive a spirit body, while those resurrected to life on earth receive a healthy physical body, completely sound.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 35:​5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:42-46:15:44" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:42-​44,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:50-46:15:50" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 50</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Who will be resurrected?</strong> The Bible says that “there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) The righteous include faithful people, such as Noah, Sarah, and Abraham. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 6:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:11-58:11:11" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:21-59:2:21" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> James 2:​21</a>) The unrighteous include those who failed to meet God’s standards but did not have the opportunity to learn and follow them.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>However, those who become so wicked that they are beyond reform will not be resurrected. When such ones die, they suffer permanent destruction with no hope of a return to life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:33-40:23:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 23:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:26-58:10:27" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Hebrews 10:26, 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>When will the resurrection take place?</strong> The Bible foretold that the resurrection to heaven would take place during Christ’s presence, which <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502014148/">began in 1914</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:21-46:15:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:21-​23</a>) The resurrection to life on earth will occur during the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus Christ, when the earth will be transformed into a paradise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 23:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Revelation 20:​6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:12-66:20:13" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Why is belief in the resurrection reasonable?</strong> The Bible provides detailed accounts of nine resurrections, each confirmed by eyewitnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:17-11:17:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:17-​24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:32-12:4:37" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 4:​32-​37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:13:20-12:13:21" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 13:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:11-42:7:17" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Luke 7:​11-​17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:40-42:8:56" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> 8:​40-​56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:38-43:11:44" data-bid="14-6" class="b"> John 11:38-​44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:36-44:9:42" data-bid="14-7" class="b"> Acts 9:​36-​42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:7-44:20:12" data-bid="14-8" class="b"> Acts 20:​7-​12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:3-46:15:6" data-bid="14-9" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:​3-6</a>) Jesus’ resurrection of Lazarus is especially noteworthy, since Lazarus had been dead for four days and Jesus performed the miracle before a crowd of people.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>The Bible shows that God has both the ability and the desire to bring back the dead. He keeps in his limitless memory a detailed record of each person he will resurrect by means of his almighty power.

Describing the coming resurrection, the Bible says of God: “You will long for the work of your hands.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:15-18:14:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 14:15</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>Misconceptions about the resurrection</strong></h3>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Myth:</strong> The resurrection is a reuniting of the soul with the body.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The Bible teaches that <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502014103/">the soul is the entire person</a>, not some part that survives death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a>, footnote; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:4-26:18:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:4</a>) A person who is resurrected is not reunited with his soul; he is recreated as a living soul.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Myth:</strong> Some people are resurrected and then immediately destroyed.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The Bible says that “those who practiced vile things” will receive “a resurrection of judgment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:29-43:5:29" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 5:​29</a>) However, they will be judged based on what they do after they are resurrected, not before. Jesus said: “The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who have paid attention will live.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:25-43:5:25" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 5:​25</a>) Those who ‘pay attention’ to, or obey, the things they learn after they are resurrected will have their names recorded in “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502013277/">the scroll of life</a>.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:12-66:20:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 20:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Myth:</strong> When resurrected, a person receives exactly the same body that he had before he died.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> After death, a person’s body would likely have broken down and disintegrated.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:19-21:3:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:​19, 20</a>.</p>
