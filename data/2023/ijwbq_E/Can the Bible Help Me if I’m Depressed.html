<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes, because the best help comes from “God, Who comforts and encourages and refreshes and cheers the depressed.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:6-47:7:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>, <em>The Amplified Bible</em>.</p>
<h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>What God gives to help the depressed</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  <strong>Strength.</strong> God “refreshes and cheers” you, not by removing all your problems, but by answering your prayers when you pray for the strength to cope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a>) You can be sure that he’s ready to listen to you, for the Bible says: “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012489/">Jehovah</a>  is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>) In fact, God can hear your call for help even if you can’t put your feelings into words.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:26-45:8:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 8:26, 27</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Good examples.</strong> One Bible writer prayed to God: “From the depths of my despair I call to you.” This psalmist dealt with his depression by remembering that God doesn’t burden us with guilt. Instead, he said to God: “If you kept a record of our sins, who could escape being condemned? But you forgive us, so that we should stand in awe of you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:1-19:130:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 130:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:3-19:130:4" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>, <em>Good News Translation</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Hope.</strong> Besides providing comfort now, God has promised to remove all the problems that lead to depression. When he fulfills that promise, “the former things [including depression] will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:17</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Note: While acknowledging the help that God provides, Jehovah’s Witnesses also seek medical treatment for ailments such as clinical depression. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:2:17-41:2:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 2:17</a>) We do not, however, endorse any specific medical treatment; we feel that each person should make his own decision on such matters.</p>
