<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Some people have become confused about the location of the Kingdom by the rendering of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:21-42:17:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 17:21</a> in some Bible translations. For example, the <em>King James Version</em> says that “the kingdom of God is within you.” To understand this verse correctly, we must consider the context.</p>

Jesus told them: “Inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:27-40:23:28" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 23:27, 28</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Other translations accurately clarify Jesus’ statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:21-42:17:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 17:21</a>: “God’s kingdom is here <em>with</em> you.” (Italics ours; <em>Contemporary English Version</em>) “The Kingdom of God is <em>among</em> you.” (<em>New World Translation,</em> footnote) The Kingdom of heaven was “with” or “among” the Pharisees, in that Jesus, the one designated by God to rule as King, was standing before them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 1:​32, 33</a>.</p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div id="footnote1" data-fnid="1" class="fn-ref"><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> Many Christian denominations teach that the Kingdom of God is within a person, or in someone’s heart. For example, in the United States, the Southern Baptist Convention declared that the Kingdom of God is in part “the reign of God in the heart and life of the individual.” Similarly, in his book <em>Jesus of Nazareth,</em> Pope Benedict XVI stated that “the Kingdom of God comes by way of a listening heart.”</p></div>
