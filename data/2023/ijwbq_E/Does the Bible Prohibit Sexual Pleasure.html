<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Rather than prohibit sexual pleasure, the Bible shows that it is a gift from God to married people. He created humans “male and female” and viewed what he had made as being “very good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:​27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 31</a>) When he brought the first man and woman together in marriage, he said that “they must become one flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:24-1:2:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 2:​24</a>) This bond included the pleasure of sexual intimacy along with a close emotional connection.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The Bible describes the pleasure that husbands find in marriage with these words: “Rejoice with the wife of your youth . . . Let her own breasts intoxicate you at all times. With her love may you be in an ecstasy constantly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:18-20:5:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:​18, 19</a>) God also intends for wives to enjoy sex. The Bible says: “Husbands and wives should satisfy each other’s sexual needs.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:3-46:7:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>, God’s Word Bible.</p>
<h3 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Limits on sexual pleasure</strong></h3>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>God reserves sexual relations for marriage mates only, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a> shows: “Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.” Married couples must be faithful and <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:2008808/">maintain their commitment to each other</a> . They find the greatest delight, not by pursuing selfish gratification, but by applying the Bible principle: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>
