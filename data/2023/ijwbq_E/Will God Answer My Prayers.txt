Will God Answer My Prayers?


The Bible’s answer
Yes, he will. Both the Bible and real-life experience show that God answers prayers. The Bible says: “The desire of those fearing [God] he will perform, and their cry for help he will hear, and he will save them.” (Psalm 145:19) But whether God will answer you when you pray is largely up to you.
What matters to God
  Praying to God, not to Jesus, Mary, saints, angels, or images. Only Jehovah God is the “Hearer of prayer.”​—Psalm 65:2.

  Praying in harmony with God’s will, or requirements, which are found in the Bible.​—1 John 5:14.

  Praying in Jesus’ name, recognizing his authority. “No one comes to the Father except through me,” said Jesus.​—John 14:6.

  Praying in faith, asking for more faith if needed.​—Matthew 21:22; Luke 17:5.

  Being humble and sincere. The Bible says: “Jehovah is high, and yet the humble one he sees.”​—Psalm 138:6.

  Being persistent. Jesus said: “Keep on asking, and it will be given you.”​—Luke 11:9.


What doesn’t matter to God
  Your race or nationality. “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.”​—Acts 10:34, 35.

  Your bodily position or posture. You can pray to God while sitting, bowing, kneeling, or standing.​—1 Chronicles 17:16; Nehemiah 8:6; Daniel 6:10; Mark 11:25.

  Whether you pray aloud or silently. God answers even silent prayers that others aren’t aware of.​—Nehemiah 2:1-6.

  Whether your concerns are weighty or trivial. God encourages you to “throw all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.”​—1 Peter 5:7.
