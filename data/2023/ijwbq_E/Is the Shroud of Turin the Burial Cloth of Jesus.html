</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Shroud of Turin is not mentioned in the Bible. It is a linen sheet thought by many to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. As a result of this belief, the shroud is considered by some to be one of Christendom’s most sacred relics. A cathedral in Turin, Italy, now houses the shroud in a high-tech protective casing.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Do Bible accounts support the idea that the Shroud of Turin is genuine? No.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Consider three aspects of the shroud that differ from what the Bible says.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>              <strong>The shroud</strong> is a single cloth measuring 442 by 113 centimeters (14 ft 6 in. by 3 ft 8 in.) plus an 8-centimeter (3 in.) strip sewed lengthwise.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>What the Bible says:</strong> Jesus’ dead body was wrapped, not in one piece of linen, but in <em>multiple strips</em> of cloth. His head was wrapped in a separate cloth. After Jesus was resurrected, one of his apostles came to the empty tomb and “saw the linen cloths lying there.” The Bible adds: “The cloth that had been on his head was not lying with the other cloth bands but was rolled up in a place by itself.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:6-43:20:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 20:​6, 7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>              <strong>The shroud</strong> contains markings presumed to be bloodstains from an unwashed corpse.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>What the Bible says:</strong> When Jesus died, his disciples prepared his body “according to the burial custom of the Jews.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:39-43:19:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 19:39-​42</a>) This custom included washing the corpse and applying oils and spices to it before burial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:12-40:26:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 26:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:37-44:9:37" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Acts 9:​37</a>) Therefore, Jesus’ disciples would have washed his body before wrapping it in cloths.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>               <strong>The shroud</strong> bears the image of a man “laid lengthwise along one half of the shroud while the other half had been doubled over the head to cover the whole front of the body,” according to the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica.</em></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>What the Bible says:</strong> Jesus’ disciples discussed his death, his empty tomb, and the eyewitness testimony of women who saw “a supernatural sight of angels, who said he is alive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:15-42:24:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 24:15-​24</a>) If the shroud had been in Jesus’ tomb, his disciples would no doubt have discussed it and the images on it. However, the Bible says nothing about such a discussion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>Should the shroud be venerated?</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>No. Even if it were authentic, venerating it would still be wrong. Consider Bible principles that explain why.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>               <strong>It is unnecessary.</strong> Jesus explained: “God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 4:​24</a>) True worship does not involve the use of religious relics or icons.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>               <strong>It is forbidden.</strong> The Ten Commandments forbid idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:6-5:5:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 5:​6-​10</a>) Likewise, the Bible commands Christians: “Guard yourselves from idols.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 5:​21</a>) Some might argue that for them the shroud is not an idol but an icon, or symbol, of their religious faith. However, an icon becomes an idol to the person who venerates it.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Therefore, a person who wants to please God will not show devotion or reverence to any object, including the shroud.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sc">Since the late 19th century, researchers have tried to use scientific methods to test the authenticity of the shroud. Some of these tests have proven inconclusive. However, in 1988, the Vatican submitted small samples taken from the shroud to three laboratories in different countries. After the laboratories subjected the samples to radiocarbon dating, each one concluded that the shroud was from the 13th or 14th century.</p>
