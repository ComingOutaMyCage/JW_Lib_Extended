Is the Bible a Record of God’s Thoughts?


The Bible’s answer
Many Bible writers state that God directed what they wrote. Note these examples:
King David: “The spirit of Jehovah it was that spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.”—2 Samuel 23:1, 2.

The prophet Isaiah: “This is what the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has said.”—Isaiah 22:15.

The apostle John: “A revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave him.”—Revelation 1:1.
