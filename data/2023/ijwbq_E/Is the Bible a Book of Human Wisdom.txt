Is the Bible a Book of Human Wisdom?


The Bible’s answer
The Bible, also known as the Holy Scriptures, does contain many wise sayings. However, note the claim that the Bible makes for itself: “All Scripture is inspired of God.” (2 Timothy 3:16) There is much evidence to back up that claim. Consider the following:
  No one has ever successfully challenged the historical accuracy of the Bible.

  The Bible writers were honest men who wrote with openness of heart. Their candor gives their writing the clear ring of truth.

  The Bible has one central theme: the vindication of God’s right to rule mankind and the fulfillment of his purpose by means of his heavenly Kingdom.

  Although written thousands of years ago, the Bible is free of mistaken scientific ideas that had gained wide acceptance in ancient times.

  Documented historical evidence proves that Bible prophecies, or predictions, have come true.
