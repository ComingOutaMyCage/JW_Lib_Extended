<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>God selects a limited number of faithful Christians who, after their death, will be resurrected to life in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:​3, 4</a>) Once they have been chosen, they must continue to maintain a Christian standard of faith and conduct in order not to be disqualified from receiving their heavenly inheritance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:12-50:3:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Philippians 3:​12-​14</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>What will those who go to heaven do there?</strong></h3>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>They will serve alongside Jesus as kings and priests for 1,000 years.

Those heavenly rulers will help restore mankind to the righteous conditions that God originally intended.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:​13</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>How many will be resurrected to heaven?</strong></h3>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible indicates that 144,000 people will be resurrected to heavenly life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 7:4</a>) In the vision recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 14:​1-3</a>, the apostle John saw “the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000.” In this vision, “the Lamb” represents the resurrected Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 1:​29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:19-60:1:19" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 1:​19</a>) “Mount Zion” represents the exalted position of Jesus and the 144,000 who rule with him in the heavens.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:6-19:2:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Hebrews 12:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Those “who are called and chosen” to rule with Christ in the Kingdom are referred to as a “little flock.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:14-66:17:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 17:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Luke 12:32</a>) This shows that they would be relatively few in comparison with the complete number of Jesus’ sheep.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>

<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> All good people go to heaven.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> God promises everlasting life <em>on earth</em> for most good people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:34-19:37:34" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 34</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Jesus said: “No man has ascended into heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:13-43:3:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 3:​13</a>) He thus showed that good people who died before him, such as Abraham, Moses, Job, and David, did not go to heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:29-44:2:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 2:​29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:34-44:2:34" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 34</a>) Instead, they had the hope of being <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502014163/">resurrected</a> to life on earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:13-18:14:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 14:13-​15</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  The resurrection to heavenly life is called “the first resurrection.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 20:6</a>) This indicates that there will be another resurrection. It will be an earthly one.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  The Bible teaches that under the rule of <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012121/">God’s Kingdom</a>, “death will be no more.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 21:​3, 4</a>) This promise must apply to the earth, since death has never existed in heaven.</p>

</div><div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> Each person chooses whether he or she will receive life in heaven or on earth.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> God determines which faithful Christians receive “the prize of the upward call,” that is, the hope of heavenly life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:14-50:3:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Philippians 3:​14</a>) Personal desire or ambition has no bearing on a person’s being chosen.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:20-40:20:23" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 20:20-​23</a>.</p>
</div><div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> The hope of everlasting life on earth is an inferior one, offered only to those not worthy of going to heaven.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> God calls those who will receive everlasting life on earth “my people,” “my chosen ones,” and “those blessed by Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-​23</a>) They will have the privilege of fulfilling God’s original purpose for humankind​—everlasting life in perfection on a paradise earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 1:​28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:16-19:115:16" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Psalm 115:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Isaiah 45:18</a>.</p>
</div><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> The number 144,000 mentioned in Revelation is symbolic, not literal.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> Although Revelation contains symbolic numbers, some of the numbers it uses are literal. For example, it speaks of “the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:14-66:21:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 21:14</a>) Consider the evidence for concluding that the number 144,000 should likewise be taken literally.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 7:4</a> records “the number of those who were sealed [or, confirmed for life in heaven], 144,000.” In the immediate context of this verse, a second group is contrasted: “a great crowd, which no man was able to number.” Those of the “great crowd” also receive salvation from God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 7:​9, 10</a>) If the number 144,000 were symbolic, referring instead to a group without number, then the contrast between the two groups would be lost.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>In addition, the 144,000 are described as being “bought from among mankind as firstfruits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:4-66:14:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Revelation 14:4</a>) The expression “firstfruits” refers to a small representative selection. It aptly describes those who will rule in heaven with Christ over an undetermined number of subjects on earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:10-66:5:10" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 5:​10</a>.</p>

Thomas wrote regarding the figure 144,000 mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 7:4</a>: “It is a definite number in contrast with the indefinite number of 7:9.
