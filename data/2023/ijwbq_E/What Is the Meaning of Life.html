<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The question of the meaning of life may be asked in many ways, such as Why are we here? or Does my life have a purpose? The Bible shows that our purpose in life is to build a friendship with God. Consider some of these fundamental truths that the Bible reveals.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  God is our Creator. The Bible says: “It is [God] that has made us, and not we ourselves.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:3-19:100:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 100:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:11</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  God has a purpose for everything he creates, including us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  God created us with a “spiritual need,” which includes the desire to find meaning in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) He wants us to satisfy that desire.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 145:16</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  We fill our spiritual need by building a friendship with God. Although the idea of being God’s friend might seem far-fetched to some, the Bible gives us this encouragement: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:23</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  To become God’s friend, we must live in harmony with his purpose for us. The Bible states this purpose at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:13-21:12:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>: “Have reverence for God, and obey his commands, because this is all that we were created for.”​—<em>Good News Translation</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  In the future, we can experience in full God’s original purpose for us when he eliminates <a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:2012804/">suffering</a> and grants everlasting life to his friends, those who worship him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>.</p>
</li>
