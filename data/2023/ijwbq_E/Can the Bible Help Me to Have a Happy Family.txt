Can the Bible Help Me to Have a Happy Family?


The Bible’s answer
Yes. Here’s a sample of wise advice based on the Bible that has helped millions of men and women to gain family happiness:
                Legalize your marriage. The lifetime commitment of a legal marriage is the foundation for a happy family.​—Matthew 19:4-6.

              Show love and respect. This includes treating your mate in the way that you would like to be treated.​—Matthew 7:12; Ephesians 5:25, 33.

              Avoid harsh words. Speak kindly, even if your mate says or does something hurtful. (Ephesians 4:31, 32) As the Bible says at Proverbs 15:1: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage, but a word causing pain makes anger to come up.”

               Be faithful to each other. Reserve your romantic and sexual attention only for your spouse. (Matthew 5:28) The Bible says: “Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement.”​—Hebrews 13:4.

               Train your children with love. Avoid both leniency and harshness.​—Proverbs 29:15; Colossians 3:21.
