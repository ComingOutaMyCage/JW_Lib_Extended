<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes. The Bible, an ancient book of wisdom, provides answers to life’s important questions and can help you to feel better and have a sense of well-being. Consider some questions that it answers.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>               <strong>Is there a Creator?</strong> The Bible says that God “created all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>) As our Creator, God knows what we need to feel good and to find fulfillment in life.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>                 <strong>Does God care about me?</strong> Rather than portraying God as aloof from mankind, the Bible says: “He is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 17:27</a>) He is interested in what happens to you and wants to help you succeed in life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>                 <strong>How can knowing God help me to feel better?</strong> God created us with a “spiritual need,” an innate hunger to understand the meaning and purpose of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) Our spiritual need also includes a desire to know our Creator and to have a relationship with him. God will welcome your efforts to get to know him, for the Bible says: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Many religions that use the Bible do not actually follow its teachings. In contrast, true religion, which adheres to what the Bible really says, will help you to get to know God.</p>
