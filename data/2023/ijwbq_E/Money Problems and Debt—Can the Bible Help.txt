Money Problems and Debt​—⁠Can the Bible Help?


The Bible’s answer
Yes. The following four Bible principles can help you with money problems and debt:
              Plan your spending. “The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage, but everyone that is hasty surely heads for want.” (Proverbs 21:5) Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s on sale. Make a financial plan​—a budget​—and stick to it.

              Avoid unnecessary debt. “The borrower is servant to the man doing the lending.” (Proverbs 22:7) If you are already in debt and can’t meet your obligations, try to negotiate new payment plans with your creditors. Be persistent. Use the Bible’s advice to one who unwisely guaranteed a loan and thus took on responsibility for the debt: “Humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. Don’t let your eyes rest or your eyelids close.” (Proverbs 6:1-5, God’s Word Bible) Even if your first request isn’t successful, keep on asking for an adjustment.

              Keep money in its proper place. “Don’t be selfish and eager to get rich​—you will end up worse off than you can imagine.” (Proverbs 28:22, Contemporary English Version) Envy and greed not only can lead to financial ruin but also can crowd out spiritual matters.

               Be content. “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” (1 Timothy 6:8) Money can’t buy happiness or contentment. Some of the happiest people in the world do not have a lot of money. What they do have is the love of family and friends and a friendship with God.​—Proverbs 15:17; 1 Peter 5:6, 7.
