<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Lord’s Prayer provides guidance for us as to how we should pray and what we should pray about. Jesus gave it in response to his disciples’ request: “Lord, teach us how to pray.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:1-42:11:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 11:1</a>) However, the Lord’s Prayer, or the Our Father prayer, is not the only prayer that God accepts.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Rather, Jesus gave it as a pattern for prayers that God hears.</p>

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>What does the Lord’s Prayer say?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The Lord’s Prayer, recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9-13</a>, is worded differently in various Bible translations. Here are two examples.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>New World Translation:</em> “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth. Give us today our bread for this day; and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><em>King James Version:</em> “Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>What is the meaning of the Lord’s Prayer?</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Jesus’ teaching agreed with the rest of the Scriptures, so we can expect other parts of the Bible to shed light on the meaning of the Lord’s Prayer.</p>
<h3 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong><em>“Our Father in the heavens”</em></strong></h3>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>It is fitting to address God as “our Father” because he created us and gave us life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:64:8-23:64:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 64:8</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong><em>“Let your name be sanctified”</em></strong></h3>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>God’s name, Jehovah, should be honored and treated as holy, or sacred. Humans share in sanctifying God’s name when they speak of his qualities and make known his purposes.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:3-23:6:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isaiah 6:3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong><em>“Let your Kingdom come”</em></strong></h3>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government with Jesus as its King. Jesus taught us to pray for this government to exercise its rule over the whole earth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Revelation 11:15</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong><em>“Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth”</em></strong></h3>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Just as there is no evil or death in heaven, God’s will for the earth is that humans live forever on it in peace and security.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 29</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p24" data-pid="24"><strong><em>“Give us today our bread for this day”</em></strong></h3>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>In Jesus’ time, bread was a staple food. We should remember that we depend on our Creator to provide the things we need in order to live.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:24-44:17:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 17:24, 25</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p26" data-pid="26"><strong><em>“Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors”</em></strong></h3>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>In this context, the word “debts” is another word for sins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:4-42:11:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 11:4</a>) All humans sin and need forgiveness. But if we want to receive God’s forgiveness, we must be willing to forgive others for their sins against us.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 6:14, 15</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p28" data-pid="28"><strong><em>“Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one”</em></strong></h3>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Jehovah God never tempts us to do wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:13-59:1:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 1:13</a>) But we are tempted by “the wicked one,” Satan the Devil—who is also called “the Tempter.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:1-40:4:4" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Matthew 4:1-4</a>) We ask that Jehovah not permit us to give in when we are tempted to disobey him.</p>
<h2 id="p30" data-pid="30"><strong>Is reciting the Lord’s Prayer the only way to pray?</strong></h2>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>Jesus provided the Lord’s Prayer as an example. It is not to be recited word for word. Just before providing the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus warned: “When praying, do not say the same things over and over again.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:7-40:6:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 6:7</a>) When he provided a model prayer on another occasion, he used different wording.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:2-42:11:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 11:2-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>The best way to pray is to use sincere personal expressions from our heart.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:8-19:62:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 62:8</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p33" data-pid="33"><strong>How should we pray?</strong></h2>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>The Lord’s Prayer provides a good example of how to pray in a way that God hears. Note how it agrees with other Bible verses about prayer.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  <strong>Pray only to God</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>Scripture:</strong> “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> Our prayers should be addressed to God—not to <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:2015007/">Jesus</a>, <a class="xt" data-xtid="103" href="jwpub://p/E:102005649/">Mary</a>, or <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012527/">saints</a>. With the opening words, “Our Father,” the Lord’s Prayer teaches us to pray to Jehovah God alone.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>  <strong>Pray for things that harmonize with God’s will</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>Scripture:</strong> “No matter what we ask according to his will, he hears us.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 John 5:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> We can pray about anything that is in harmony with God’s will. Jesus taught us how important God’s will is by including in the Lord’s Prayer the expression “let your will take place.” We can learn about God’s will for the earth and for humans by studying the Bible.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>  <strong>Pray about personal concerns</strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>Scripture:</strong> “Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> God cares about our concerns. Just as Jesus included several personal requests in the Lord’s Prayer, we can pray for our daily physical needs, for guidance when making important decisions, for support in troubled times, and for forgiveness for our sins.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div id="footnote1" data-fnid="1" class="fn-ref"><p id="p45" data-pid="45"><a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> For example, Jesus and his disciples offered other prayers that did not stick to the specific words used in this model prayer.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:34-42:23:34" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 23:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:9-50:1:9" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Philippians 1:9</a>.</p></div>
<div id="footnote2" data-fnid="2" class="fn-ref"><p id="p46" data-pid="46"><a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> The <em>King James Version</em> concludes the Lord’s Prayer with the phrase: “For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.” This expression of praise to God, also found in some other Bibles, is known as a doxology. However, <em>The Jerome Biblical Commentary</em> states: “The doxology . . . is not found in the most reliable [manuscripts].”</p></div>
<div id="footnote3" data-fnid="3" class="fn-ref"><p id="p47" data-pid="47"><a href="#footnotesource3" class="fn-symbol">c</a> Those who sense that they need God’s forgiveness might feel too guilty to pray. But Jehovah appeals to such ones: “Let us set matters straight between us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:18</a>) He will not reject any who sincerely seek his forgiveness.</p></div>
