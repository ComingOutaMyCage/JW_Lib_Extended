Was Jesus Just a Good Man?


The Bible’s answer
Jesus was more than just a good man. At the very least, he has proved to be the most influential man in human history. Note what these famous historians and writers have said about him:
“Jesus of Nazareth . . . is easily the dominant figure in history.”—H. G. Wells, English historian.

“[Jesus’] life is the most influential ever lived on this planet and its effect continues to mount.”—Kenneth Scott Latourette, American historian and author.

The Bible identifies why Jesus has had a greater impact than any other good man who ever lived. When Jesus asked his closest followers who they thought he was, one of them correctly answered: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”—Matthew 16:16.
