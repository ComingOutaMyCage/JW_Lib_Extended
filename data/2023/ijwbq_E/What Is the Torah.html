<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The English word “Torah” comes from the Hebrew word <em>toh·rahʹ,</em> which can be translated as “instruction,” “teaching,” or “law.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:8-20:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:1-20:3:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:4-20:28:4" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 28:4</a>) The following examples show how this Hebrew word is used in the Bible.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  <em>Toh·rahʹ</em> often refers to <em>the first five books of the Bible</em>​—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These are also called the Pentateuch, from a Greek word meaning “fivefold volume.” The Torah was written by <a class="xt" data-xtid="45" href="jwpub://p/E:2013089/">Moses</a>, so it is called “the book of the Law of Moses.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:8:31-6:8:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 8:​31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:1-16:8:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Nehemiah 8:1</a>) Evidently, it was originally written as one book but was later divided for easier handling.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <em>Toh·rahʹ</em> is also used for <em>the laws given to Israel</em> on a particular subject, such as “the law [<em>toh·rahʹ</em>] of the sin offering,” “the law about leprosy,” and “the law about the Nazirite.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:6:25-3:6:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Leviticus 6:​25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:14:57-3:14:57" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14:57;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:6:13-4:6:13" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Numbers 6:​13</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <em>Toh·rahʹ</em> sometimes refers to <em>instruction</em> and <em>teaching,</em> whether from parents, wise ones, or God himself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:8-20:1:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:1-20:3:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:14-20:13:14" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 13:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:3-23:2:3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Isaiah 2:3</a>, footnote.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  The history of God’s dealings with humankind from creation to the death of Moses.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:​27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:5-5:34:5" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 34:5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  The regulations of the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:3-2:24:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 24:3</a>) That Law is made up of more than 600 statutes. Prominent among them is the Shema, or Jewish confession of faith. One portion of the Shema says: “You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:​4-9</a>) Jesus described this as “the greatest and first commandment.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:36-40:22:38" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 22:36-​38</a>.</p>

Rather than prohibit the use of God’s name, the Torah contains commands that <em>required</em> God’s people to pronounce it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:6:22-4:6:27" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Numbers 6:​22-​27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:13-5:6:13" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 6:​13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:8-5:10:8" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 10:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:5-5:21:5" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 21:5</a>.</p>

<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> The laws of the Torah are eternal, never to be set aside.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> Some Bible translations do refer to specific statutes of the Torah​—including those related to the Sabbath, the priesthood, and the Day of Atonement​—as being “perpetual” or “everlasting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:16-2:31:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 31:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:15-2:40:15" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 40:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:33-3:16:34" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Leviticus 16:33, 34</a>, <em>King James Version</em>) However, the Hebrew word used in these verses can also mean lasting into the indefinite future, not necessarily lasting forever.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> After the Mosaic Law covenant had been in force for about 900 years, God foretold that he would replace it with “a new covenant.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-​33</a>) By “saying ‘a new covenant,’ [God] made the former [covenant] obsolete.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:7-58:8:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 8:​7-​13</a>) It was replaced about 2,000 years ago on the basis of the death of Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:15-49:2:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:​15</a>.</p>
</div><div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> Jewish oral traditions and the Talmud have authority equal to the written Torah.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> There is no Scriptural evidence that God gave Moses an oral law to accompany the written Torah. Instead, the Bible states: “Jehovah went on to say to Moses: ‘You are to <em>write down</em> these words.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:27-2:34:27" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 34:27</a>) The oral law, later written down and known as the Mishnah and finally expanded into the Talmud, consists of Jewish traditions that began with the Pharisees. These traditions often conflicted with the Torah. For this reason, Jesus told the Pharisees: “You have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:1-40:15:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 15:​1-9</a>.</p>
</div><div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> Women should not be taught the Torah.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The Mosaic Law included a regulation that the entire Law be read to all the people of Israel, including the women and children. Why? “In order that they may listen and learn about and fear Jehovah [their] God and take care to carry out all the words of [the] Law.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:10-5:31:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:10-​12</a>.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> Moses, who recorded the Torah, stated that its message is clear and accessible to all, not hidden in a code. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:11-5:30:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:11-​14</a>) The theory that there are hidden messages in the Torah is rooted in Kabbalah, or traditional Jewish mysticism, which uses “artfully contrived” methods to interpret the Scriptures.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:16-61:1:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:​16</a>.</p>

<div id="footnote3" data-fnid="3" class="fn-ref"><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><a href="#footnotesource3" class="fn-symbol">c</a> In contrast to what the Torah itself teaches, Jewish legal tradition often prohibited women from studying the Torah. For example, the Mishnah quotes Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus as saying: “Whoever teaches his daughter Torah, it is as though he teaches her obscenity.” (<em>Sotah</em> 3:4) The Jerusalem Talmud includes his statement: “Let the words of the Torah rather be destroyed by fire than imparted to women.”​—<em>Sotah</em> 3:​19a.</p></div>
