What Does the Devil Look Like?


The Bible’s answer
The Devil is an invisible spirit person, which means that he does not have a physical appearance.—Ephesians 6:11, 12.





A popular depiction of the Devil is that of a goatlike creature with horns, a tail, and a pitchfork. Some have suggested that such depictions of the Devil were conceived by medieval artists who were likely influenced by folklore and ancient mythology.
