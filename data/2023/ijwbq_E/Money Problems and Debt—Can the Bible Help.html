<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes. The following four Bible principles can help you with money problems and debt:</p>
<ol><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>              <strong>Plan your spending.</strong> “The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage, but everyone that is hasty surely heads for want.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:5</a>) Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s on sale. Make a financial plan​—a budget​—and stick to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>              <strong>Avoid unnecessary debt.</strong> “The borrower is servant to the man doing the lending.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:7-20:22:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:7</a>) If you are already in debt and can’t meet your obligations, try to negotiate new payment plans with your creditors. Be persistent. Use the Bible’s advice to one who unwisely guaranteed a loan and thus took on responsibility for the debt: “Humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. Don’t let your eyes rest or your eyelids close.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:1-20:6:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>, God’s Word Bible) Even if your first request isn’t successful, keep on asking for an adjustment.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>              <strong>Keep money in its proper place.</strong> “Don’t be selfish and eager to get rich​—you will end up worse off than you can imagine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:22-20:28:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:22</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version</em>) Envy and greed not only can lead to financial ruin but also can crowd out spiritual matters.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>               <strong>Be content.</strong> “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:8</a>) Money can’t buy happiness or contentment. Some of the happiest people in the world do not have a lot of money. What they do have is the love of family and friends and a friendship with God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:17-20:15:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:6-60:5:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:6, 7</a>.</p>
