Can the Devil Control Humans?


The Bible’s answer
The Devil and the demons influence mankind so much that the Bible says: “The Evil One controls the whole world.” (1 John 5:​19, New Century Version) The Bible identifies ways that the Devil exerts this influence on people.
  Deception. The Bible encourages Christians to “fight against the devil’s evil tricks.” (Ephesians 6:​11, NCV ) One of his tricks is to deceive people into believing that his agents are actually servants of God.​—2 Corinthians 11:13-​15.

  Spiritism. The Devil misleads people through spirit mediums, fortune-tellers, and those who practice divination or astrology. (Deuteronomy 18:10-​12) Drug use, hypnotism, and meditation techniques that empty the mind also expose a person to demon control.​—Luke 11:24-​26.

  False religion. Religions that teach false doctrines mislead people into disobeying God. (1 Corinthians 10:20) The Bible calls such false beliefs “teachings of demons.”​—1 Timothy 4:1.

  Possession. The Bible records cases of evil spirits taking control of individuals. Sometimes demon-possessed people were struck blind or mute or even injured themselves.​—Matthew 12:22; Mark 5:​2-5.


How to avoid the Devil’s influence
You need not live in dread of demon control, for the Bible shows how you can successfully oppose the Devil:
  Learn to recognize the Devil’s methods so that you are “not ignorant of his designs.”​—2 Corinthians 2:​11.

  Take in knowledge from the Bible, and then apply what you learn. Applying Bible principles will protect you from the Devil’s influence.​—Ephesians 6:​11-​18.

  Get rid of anything connected with demon activity. (Acts 19:19) That includes music, books, magazines, posters, and videos that encourage spiritism.
