<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible does not directly mention pornography, cybersex, or similar activities. However, the Bible is very clear on how God feels about actions that promote sex outside marriage or a distorted view of sex. Consider these Bible verses:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  “Deaden, therefore, your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>) Rather than deadening wrong desires, viewing pornography inflames them. It makes one unclean, or dirty, in God’s eyes.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  “Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:28-40:5:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:​28</a>) Images of immoral sexual practices trigger wrong thoughts that lead to wrong actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  “Let fornication and uncleanness of every sort or greediness not even be mentioned among you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3</a>) We shouldn’t for pleasure even mention immoral sex, much less watch or read about it.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  “The works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, . . . and things like these. As to these things I am forewarning you, the same way as I did forewarn you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Galatians 5:​19-​21</a>) God views those who use pornography or engage in cybersex, phone sex, or sexting as being unclean, morally contaminated. If we were to make a practice of such things, we could completely lose God’s favor.</p>
