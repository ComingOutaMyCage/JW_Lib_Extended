<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible foretold that pestilences (widespread diseases, including pandemics) would occur during the last days. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) Such pandemics are not divine retribution or punishment from God. In fact, by means of his Kingdom, God will soon put an end to all health problems, including pandemics.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Did the Bible foretell pandemics?</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The Bible does not foretell specific pandemics or diseases, such as COVID-19, AIDS, or the Spanish flu. But it does foretell “pestilences” and “deadly plague.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:8-66:6:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Revelation 6:8</a>) These events are part of the sign of “the last days,” also referred to as “the conclusion of the system of things.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Has God ever punished people with sickness?</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible reports a few occasions when God used sickness to punish people. For example, he caused some individuals to have leprosy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:1-4:12:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Numbers 12:1-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:20-12:5:27" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 5:20-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:21" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>) However, these isolated incidents were not indiscriminate pandemics that spread to innocent people. Rather, such events were specific judgments on individuals who had clearly rebelled against God.</p>
<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>Are today’s pandemics punishment from God?</strong></h2>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>No. Some people claim that God is using pandemics and other sicknesses to punish people today. However, the Bible does not support that claim. Why not?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>For one thing, some of God’s worshippers—both past and present—have been plagued with sickness. The faithful man Timothy, for example, suffered “frequent cases of sickness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:23-54:5:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:23</a>) But the Bible does not say that this was a sign of God’s disfavor. Likewise today, some faithful servants of God become sick or contract diseases. Oftentimes, these individuals were simply in the <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502014220/">wrong place at the wrong time</a>.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Moreover, the Bible teaches that God’s time to punish the wicked has not yet arrived. Rather, we are living “in a day of salvation”​—that is, a time when God is extending a warm invitation to all humans to draw close to him and be saved. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:2-47:6:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>) One way he extends that invitation is by means of a global preaching work with a positive message​—the “good news of the Kingdom.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>Will pandemics ever end?</strong></h2>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Yes. The Bible foretells a time in the near future when no one will be sick. Under the rule of his Kingdom, God will cure all health problems. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 35:5, 6</a>) He will do away with suffering, pain, and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>) And he will <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502014163/">bring back to life</a> those who have died so that they can enjoy good health here on earth under perfect conditions.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>.</p>
