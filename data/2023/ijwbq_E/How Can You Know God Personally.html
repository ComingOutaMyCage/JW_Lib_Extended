<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>You can get to know God personally by learning about him and taking steps to please him. God will then “draw close to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) The Bible assures us that “he is not far off from each one of us.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 17:27</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> God is the Author of the Bible. He put his thoughts into the minds of the Bible writers. By means of this unique book, God has revealed his will for us. He has also revealed facets of his personality, including his love, justice, and mercy.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 32:4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Read the Bible daily. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8</a>) Reflect on what you read, asking yourself: ‘What does this teach me about God as a Person?’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:77:12-19:77:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 77:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>As an example, read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:11</a>, and then ask yourself: ‘What does God want for me—peace or calamity? Is he a vengeful God, or does he want me to have a good future?’</p>

<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>What the Bible says:</strong> “[God’s] invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> God’s physical creations reveal aspects of his personality, just as a work of art can reveal much about the artist or a complex machine can say much about the inventor. To illustrate, the capacity and complexity of the human brain reveal God’s wisdom, and the controlled energy in the sun and other stars demonstrates his power.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 104:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Isaiah 40:26</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Take time to observe and learn about our natural world.

</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> To draw close to God, we must have faith in him.

<div class="grpItems bottomRule"><p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> God is too powerful and important to want to be close to us.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> Even though God is the most powerful and important Being in all existence, he invites us to draw close to him. The Bible contains many examples of men and women who became his close friends.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:22-44:13:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 13:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> James 2:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> Some things about God are difficult to comprehend, such as his being an invisible Spirit. Still, we can get to know God. In fact, the Bible says that we need to know him in order to gain everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) In terms we can understand, the Bible tells us about our Creator, revealing his personality, his purpose for mankind and for the earth, and his standards.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>) We can thus not only know God but also draw close to him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="26-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>.</p>
