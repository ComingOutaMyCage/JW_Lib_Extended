<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible uses a number of analogies regarding the Devil. These help us to understand, not his <strong>appearance,</strong> but his <strong>personality.</strong> Some of these analogies include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>An angel of light.</strong> He pretends to offer something good to try to get people to follow his teachings rather than those of God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:14-47:11:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>A roaring lion.</strong> He fiercely attacks God’s worshippers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>A great dragon.</strong> He is frightful, powerful, and destructive.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9</a>.</p>
