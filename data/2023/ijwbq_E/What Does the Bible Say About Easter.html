<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The celebration of Easter is not based on the Bible. If you look into its history, though, you will see the true meaning of Easter—it is a tradition based on ancient fertility rites. Consider the following.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>                  <strong>Name:</strong> The <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> says: “The English name <em>Easter</em> is of uncertain origin; the Anglo-Saxon priest Venerable Bede in the 8th century derived it from the Anglo-Saxon spring goddess Eostre.” Others link it to Astarte, the Phoenician fertility goddess who had the Babylonian counterpart Ishtar.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>                <strong>Hares, rabbits:</strong> These are symbols of fertility “handed down from the ancient ceremonial and symbolism of European and Middle Eastern pagan spring festivals.”​<em>—Encyclopædia Britannica.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>                <strong>Eggs:</strong> According to <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend</em>, the hunt for Easter eggs, supposedly brought by the Easter rabbit, “is not mere child’s play, but the vestige of a fertility rite.” Some cultures believed that the decorated Easter egg “could magically bring happiness, prosperity, health, and protection.”—<em>Traditional Festivals</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>               <strong>New Easter outfit:</strong> “It was considered discourteous and therefore bad luck to greet the Scandinavian goddess of Spring, or Eastre, in anything but fresh garb.”—<em>The Giant Book of Superstitions</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>                 <strong>Sunrise services:</strong> These have been linked to rites of ancient sun worshippers “performed at the vernal equinox welcoming the sun and its great power to bring new life to all growing things.”—<em>Celebrations—The Complete Book of American Holidays</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>The American Book of Days</em> well describes the origin of Easter: “There is no doubt that the Church in its early days adopted the old pagan customs and gave a Christian meaning to them.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The Bible warns against worshipping God by following traditions or customs that displease him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:6-41:7:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 7:6-8</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:17-47:6:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Second Corinthians 6:17</a> states: “‘Separate yourselves,’ says <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012489/">Jehovah</a>, ‘and quit touching the unclean thing.’” Easter is a pagan holiday that those who want to please God will avoid.</p>
