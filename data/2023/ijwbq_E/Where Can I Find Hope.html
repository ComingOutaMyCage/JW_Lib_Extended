<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>God wants to give us “a future and a hope,”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> the Bible says. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:11</a>) Indeed, one reason why God has given us the Bible is so that “through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) As we will see, the Bible’s sound guidance can give us a hopeful outlook on a daily basis, while its promises give us a wonderful hope for the future.</p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>How does the Bible give us a hopeful outlook?</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>By showing us practical steps that we can take to improve our life, the Bible can help us have a hopeful outlook. Consider some examples of this.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Look to the Bible for practical guidance.</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 119:105</a> states: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path.” A powerful light can do two things. It can illuminate what lies immediately in front of us, and it can shed light on the path beyond. Likewise, practical Bible principles can help us to deal effectively with problems that lie immediately before us, thus giving us a hopeful outlook on a day-to-day basis. Bible teachings can restore our strength and cause “the heart to rejoice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7, 8</a>) At the same time, the Bible sheds light on God’s wonderful purpose for the future of mankind and the earth. That hope can give us lasting joy and contentment.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Allow others to help you.</strong> When our situation seems hopeless, we may be inclined to withdraw from family or friends. The Bible tells us that such a course is unwise, for it can lead to foolish decisions and actions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:1-20:18:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:1</a>) Loved ones can be a stabilizing influence. They might also have helpful suggestions on how to deal with a difficult situation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:14-20:11:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:14</a>) At the very least, they may be able to comfort us and cheer us up, giving us the strength to persevere until things improve.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:25</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>Pray to God.</strong> The Bible says: “Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to fall.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>) Jehovah is rightly called “the God who gives hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 15:13</a>) You can pray to him about “all your worries,” confident that he cares about you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>, footnote) In fact, the Bible says: “He will make you firm, he will make you strong, he will firmly ground you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:10</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Allow trials to strengthen your hope.</strong> The Bible promises: “The one listening to [God] will dwell in security and be undisturbed by the dread of calamity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:33-20:1:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:33</a>) When a cyclone struck her house, a woman in Australia named Margaret lost many of her possessions. But instead of caving in to despair, she learned a valuable lesson—material possessions can be very temporary. Thereafter, she was even more determined to focus on things that truly matter—her family and friends, her relationship with God, and the hope set out in the Bible.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:34-19:37:34" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 37:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> James 4:8</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>What hope does the Bible offer to all mankind?</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>The Bible promises a bright future for mankind and for the earth. And that future is not far off. Indeed, the problems facing mankind today show that we are living in “the last days” of the present world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) Soon, God will take charge of earth’s affairs and eliminate injustice and suffering. He will do that by means of a world government called <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012120/">God’s Kingdom</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Revelation 11:15</a>) Jesus had that heavenly government in mind when he said in his model prayer: “Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place . . . on earth.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>God’s will for mankind is clearly stated in the Bible. Note some of the problems that God’s Kingdom will eliminate:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  <strong>No more hunger.</strong> “The earth will give its produce.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:67:6-19:67:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 67:6</a>.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  <strong>No more death.</strong> God “will wipe out every tear from [mankind’s] eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.</p>
