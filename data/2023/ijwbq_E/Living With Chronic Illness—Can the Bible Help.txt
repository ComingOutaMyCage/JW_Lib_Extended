Living With Chronic Illness​—Can the Bible Help?


The Bible’s answer
Yes. God cares about his servants who are sick. Regarding a faithful servant, the Bible says: “Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness.” (Psalm 41:3) If you are living with chronic illness, the following three steps can help you to cope:
              Pray for strength to endure. You can receive “the peace of God that excels all thought,” which can reduce your anxiety and sustain you.​—Philippians 4:6, 7.

              Be positive. The Bible says: “Being cheerful keeps you healthy. It is slow death to be gloomy all the time.” (Proverbs 17:22, Good News Translation) Cultivate your sense of humor, since this not only can lighten dark times but also can benefit your health.

              Build your hope in the future. A sound hope can help you have joy despite chronic ailments. (Romans 12:12) The Bible foretells a time when “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’” (Isaiah 33:24) God will then cure chronic illnesses that are beyond the power of modern science to solve. For example, the Bible describes the reversal of the aging process this way: “Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.”​—Job 33:25.


Note: While acknowledging the help that God provides, Jehovah’s Witnesses also seek medical treatment for chronic illness. (Mark 2:17) We do not, however, endorse any specific medical approach; we feel that each person should make his own health decisions.
