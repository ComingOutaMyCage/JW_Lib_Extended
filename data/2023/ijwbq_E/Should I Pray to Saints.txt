Should I Pray to Saints?


The Bible’s answer
No. The Bible shows that we should pray only to God, in Jesus’ name. Jesus told his disciples: “This is how you are to pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.” (Matthew 6:9, New American Bible) Never did he instruct his disciples to pray to saints, angels, or anyone other than God.
Jesus also told his followers: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6, NAB) Only Jesus is authorized by God to intercede on our behalf.—Hebrews 7:25.
What if I pray to God and also pray to saints?
As part of the Ten Commandments, God said: “I, the LORD, your God, am a jealous God.” (Exodus 20:5, NAB) In what way is God “jealous”? The footnote in the New American Bible says that he is “demanding exclusive allegiance.” God demands that acts of allegiance or worship—including prayer—be directed exclusively to him.—Isaiah 48:11.
We offend God if we pray to anyone else, even to saints or holy angels. When the apostle John tried to worship an angel, the angel stopped him by saying: “Don’t! I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brothers who bear witness to Jesus. Worship God.”—Revelation 19:10, NAB.
