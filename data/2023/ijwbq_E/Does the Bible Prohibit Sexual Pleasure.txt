Does the Bible Prohibit Sexual Pleasure?


The Bible’s answer
Rather than prohibit sexual pleasure, the Bible shows that it is a gift from God to married people. He created humans “male and female” and viewed what he had made as being “very good.” (Genesis 1:​27, 31) When he brought the first man and woman together in marriage, he said that “they must become one flesh.” (Genesis 2:​24) This bond included the pleasure of sexual intimacy along with a close emotional connection.
The Bible describes the pleasure that husbands find in marriage with these words: “Rejoice with the wife of your youth . . . Let her own breasts intoxicate you at all times. With her love may you be in an ecstasy constantly.” (Proverbs 5:​18, 19) God also intends for wives to enjoy sex. The Bible says: “Husbands and wives should satisfy each other’s sexual needs.”​—1 Corinthians 7:3, God’s Word Bible.
Limits on sexual pleasure
God reserves sexual relations for marriage mates only, as Hebrews 13:4 shows: “Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.” Married couples must be faithful and maintain their commitment to each other . They find the greatest delight, not by pursuing selfish gratification, but by applying the Bible principle: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—Acts 20:35.
