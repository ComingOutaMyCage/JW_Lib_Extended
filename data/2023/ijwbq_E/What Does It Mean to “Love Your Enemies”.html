<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Jesus demonstrated love for his enemies by forgiving those who mistreated him.

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>Why love your enemies?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>God sets the example.</strong> God “is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:35-42:6:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 6:35</a>) He “makes his sun rise on . . . the wicked.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:45-40:5:45" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 5:45</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>Love may move an enemy to change.</strong> The Bible recommends that we treat an enemy kindly, stating that by doing so, we “will be heaping burning coals on his head.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:22-20:25:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 25:22</a>) This metaphor refers to the process of heating ore to extract precious metal. Similarly, if we are kind to a person who hates us, we may melt away his anger and bring out the good in him.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>What are some ways to love your enemies?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>“Do good to those hating you.”</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:27-42:6:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 6:27</a>) “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:20-45:12:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 12:20</a>) You may find other ways to show love to an enemy by applying what is known as the <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:500100108/">Golden Rule</a>, which says: “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:31-42:6:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 6:31</a>.</p>

The Bible says: “Do not pay back . . . insult for insult. Instead, repay with a blessing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:9-60:3:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:9</a>) This advice can help us to break the cycle of hatred.</p>

<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>Should you go to war against your enemies?</strong></h2>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>No, for Jesus taught his followers that they should not fight their enemies. For example, when he warned them of an impending attack on Jerusalem, he did not tell them to stay and fight but, rather, to flee. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:21" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 21:20, 21</a>) Jesus also told the apostle Peter: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:52-40:26:52" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 26:52</a>) The Bible and secular history show that Jesus’ followers in the first century did not go to war against their enemies.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:24-55:2:24" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:24</a>.</p>

<div id="tt26" class="borderSolid--bottom">
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The Law contained no such command. Rather, it directed the Israelites to love their neighbor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:18</a>) While the term “neighbor” simply meant other humans, some Jews narrowed the meaning down to include only fellow Jews, and they believed that non-Jews were enemies who should be hated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:43-40:5:44" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 5:43, 44</a>) Jesus corrected their wrong view by relating the parable of the <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:500100122/">good, or neighborly, Samaritan</a>.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:29-42:10:37" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 10:29-37</a>.</p>
