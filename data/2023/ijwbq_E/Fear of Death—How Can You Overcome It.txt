Fear of Death​—How Can You Overcome It?


The Bible’s answer
We rightly fear death as an enemy and take reasonable steps to protect our life. (1 Corinthians 15:26) However, an irrational fear of death based on falsehood or superstition makes people “subject to slavery all through their lives.” (Hebrews 2:​15) Knowing the truth will free you from a morbid fear of death​—a fear that can rob you of the ability to enjoy life.​—John 8:​32.
The truth about death
  The dead are not conscious. (Psalm 146:4) You need not fear pain or torment after you die, for the Bible compares death to sleep.​—Psalm 13:3; John 11:11-​14.

  The dead cannot harm us. Even formerly violent enemies are “impotent in death.” (Proverbs 21:16) The Bible says that “their hate and their jealousy have already perished.”​—Ecclesiastes 9:6.

  Death is not necessarily the permanent end of our existence. By means of a resurrection, God will bring back to life people who have died.​—John 5:​28, 29; Acts 24:15.

  God promises a time when “death will be no more.” (Revelation 21:4) Concerning that day, the Bible says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it,” completely free from any fear of dying.​—Psalm 37:29.
