Is God a Trinity?


The Bible’s answer
Many Christian denominations teach that God is a Trinity. However, note what the Encyclopædia Britannica states: “Neither the word Trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the New Testament  . . . The doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies.”
In fact, the God of the Bible is never described as being part of a Trinity. Note these Bible passages:
“Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.”—Deuteronomy 6:4.

“You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—Psalm 83:18.

“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”—John 17:3.

“God is only one.”—Galatians 3:20.

Why do most Christian denominations say that God is a Trinity?
