<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible describes events, conditions, and attitudes that would mark “the conclusion of the [current] system of things,” or “the end of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>; <em>King James Version</em>) The Bible calls this time period “the last days” and the “time of the end,” or “end times.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:19-27:8:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Daniel 8:19</a>; <em>Easy-to-Read Version.</em></p>
<h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>What are some Bible prophecies about “the last days”?</strong></h2>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The Bible foretold many things that together would be “the sign” to identify the last days. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:7-42:21:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 21:7</a>) Consider some examples:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>War on a large scale.</strong> Jesus foretold: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>) Similarly, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:4-66:6:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 6:4</a> foretold a symbolic horseman representing warfare that would “take peace away from the earth.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Famine.</strong> Jesus foretold: “There will be food shortages.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>) The book of Revelation foretold an additional symbolic horseman, whose ride would result in famine on a large scale.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:5-66:6:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 6:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Great earthquakes.</strong> Jesus said that there would be “earthquakes in one place after another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Luke 21:11</a>) These great earthquakes around the world would cause suffering and loss of life on an unprecedented scale.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Disease.</strong> According to Jesus, there would be pestilences, or epidemics of “terrible diseases.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version.</em></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Crime.</strong> Although crime has existed for centuries, Jesus foretold that in the last days, there would be an “increasing of lawlessness.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Ruining of the earth.</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 11:18</a> foretold that mankind would be “ruining the earth.” They would do so in many ways, not only through violent and corrupt actions but also by bringing harm to the environment.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Deteriorating attitudes.</strong> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-4</a>, the Bible foretold that people in general would be “unthankful, disloyal, . . . not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride.” These <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:500100118/">attitudes</a> would reach such extremes that the era could rightly be described as “critical times hard to deal with.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Breakdown of the family.</strong> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:2-55:3:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:2, 3</a>, the Bible foretold that many people would have “no natural affection” for their family and that children would be “disobedient to parents.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Diminished love of God.</strong> Jesus foretold: “The love of the greater number will grow cold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 24:12</a>) Jesus meant that love for God would grow cold in most people. Likewise, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:4-55:3:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:4</a> says that in the last days, such ones would be “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Religious hypocrisy.</strong> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:5-55:3:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:5</a>, the Bible foretold that people would appear to worship God but would not truly live by his standards.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Increased understanding of Bible prophecies.</strong> The book of Daniel foretold that in “the time of the end,” many would gain increased knowledge of Bible truth, including accurate understanding of these prophecies.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 12:4</a>, footnote.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>A global preaching work.</strong> Jesus foretold: “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Widespread apathy and ridicule.</strong> Jesus foretold that people in general would ignore the overwhelming evidence of the approaching end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 24:37-39</a>) More than that, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:3-61:3:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:3, 4</a> foretold that some would ridicule the evidence, dismissing it completely.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>All prophecies fulfilled.</strong> Jesus said that the last days would be marked by the simultaneous fulfillment of all these prophecies, not just a few or even most of them.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:33-40:24:33" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 24:33</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>Are we living in “the last days”?</strong></h2>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>Yes. World conditions as well as <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502014148/">Bible chronology</a> indicate that the last days began in 1914, the year World War I began. To see how world conditions indicate that we are living in the last days, watch the following video:</p>
<video data-video="webpubvid://?pub=lffv&amp;track=322&amp;style=chromeless" data-image="502016185_univ_wsr_2.jpg"></video>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>In 1914, God’s Kingdom began ruling in heaven, and one of its first actions was to expel Satan the Devil and the demons from heaven and restrict their activity to the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7-12</a>) Satan’s influence on mankind can be seen in many of the bad attitudes and actions that make the last days “critical times hard to deal with.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>Many people are distressed by these critical times. They are concerned that society itself is deteriorating. Some even fear for the future of humanity.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>Meanwhile, others who are likewise distressed by world conditions have a hopeful outlook. They are convinced that <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012121/">God’s Kingdom</a> will soon take action to rid the world of its problems. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) They wait patiently for God to fulfill his promises, and they find comfort in the words of Jesus: “The one who has endured to the end will be saved.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:13-40:24:13" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 24:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:7-33:7:7" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Micah 7:7</a>.</p>
