<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Jesus was more than just a good man. At the very least, he has proved to be the most influential man in human history. Note what these famous historians and writers have said about him:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>“Jesus of Nazareth . . . is easily the dominant figure in history.”—H. G. Wells, English historian.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>“[Jesus’] life is the most influential ever lived on this planet and its effect continues to mount.”—Kenneth Scott Latourette, American historian and author.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The Bible identifies why Jesus has had a greater impact than any other good man who ever lived. When Jesus asked his closest followers who they thought he was, one of them correctly answered: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:16-40:16:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 16:16</a>.</p>
