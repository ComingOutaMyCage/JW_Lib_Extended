How Many Names Does God Have?


The Bible’s answer
God has just one personal name. It is written יהוה in Hebrew and is usually rendered “Jehovah” in English.a Through his prophet Isaiah, God stated: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” (Isaiah 42:8) This name appears about 7,000 times in ancient Bible manuscripts​—far more frequently than any other term for God or, indeed, anyone else’s personal name.b
Are there other names for God?
Although the Bible refers to God by only one personal name, it uses many titles and descriptions for him. The following list of some of those titles and descriptions shows how each one reveals an aspect of Jehovah’s nature or his personality.

Reasons to know and use God’s name
  God must feel that his personal name, Jehovah, is important, because he included it thousands of times in the Bible.​—Malachi 1:​11.

  God’s Son, Jesus, repeatedly stressed the importance of God’s name. For instance, he prayed to Jehovah: “Let your name be sanctified.”​—Matthew 6:9; John 17:6.

  Those who come to know and use God’s name take the first steps in building a friendship with Jehovah. (Psalm 9:​10; Malachi 3:​16) Such a relationship enables them to benefit from God’s promise: “Because he has affection for me, I will rescue him. I will protect him because he knows my name.”​—Psalm 91:14.

  The Bible acknowledges: “There are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords.’” (1 Corinthians 8:​5, 6) Yet it clearly identifies the one true God by his name, Jehovah.​—Psalm 83:18.



a Some Hebrew scholars favor the rendering “Yahweh” for God’s name.
b A shortened form of the divine name, “Jah,” appears about 50 times in the Bible, including its use in the word “Hallelujah,” or “Alleluia,” which means “Praise Jah.”​—Revelation 19:1; American Standard Version; King James Version.
