<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>People have used the teachings of Jesus Christ to form a variety of “Christian” denominations. However, the Bible indicates that there is only one true form of Christianity. Consider just three reasons for reaching this conclusion.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>            Jesus said that he taught “the truth,” and early Christians referred to their religion as “the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:​32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:2-61:2:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:4-63:1:4" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 2 John 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:3-64:1:3" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 3 John 3</a>) These expressions show that those who promote doctrines that conflict with Jesus’ teachings are not practicing a true form of Christianity.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>            The Bible teaches that Christians “should all speak in agreement.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:​10</a>) However, many Christian denominations disagree on teachings as basic as what it means to be a Christian. Such denominations cannot all be right.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:​21</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>             Jesus prophesied that many would claim to be Christian yet fail to obey his commands and that he would reject such ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 7:​21-​23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:46-42:6:46" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Luke 6:​46</a>) Some people would be misled by religious leaders who corrupt true worship to further their own interests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:15-40:7:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 7:​15</a>) However, other people would actually prefer imitation Christianity because it would tell them what they want to hear rather than the truth from the Bible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:3-55:4:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:​3, 4</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>In his illustration of the wheat and the weeds, Jesus foretold a great rebellion (apostasy) against true Christianity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:24-40:13:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 13:24-​30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:36-40:13:43" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 36-​43</a>) For a long period of time, true Christians and false Christians would be indistinguishable. Just as Jesus foretold, the apostasy flourished after the apostles died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 20:29, 30</a>) While apostate teachings may vary, the various forms of imitation Christianity have all “deviated from the truth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:18-55:2:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:​18</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Jesus also predicted that the distinction between true and false Christianity would eventually become clear. This has happened in our time, during the “conclusion of a system of things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:30-40:13:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 13:30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:39-40:13:39" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 39</a>.</p>
