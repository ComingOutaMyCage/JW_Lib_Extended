Do Messianic Prophecies Prove That Jesus Was the Messiah?


The Bible’s answer
Yes. While on earth, Jesus fulfilled numerous prophecies about “Messiah the Leader,” the one who would be the “Savior of the world.” (Daniel 9:​25; 1 John 4:​14)  And even after his death, Jesus continued to fulfill Messianic prophecies.​—Psalm 110:1; Acts 2:​34-​36.

What is the meaning of “Messiah”?
The Hebrew term Ma·shiʹach (Messiah) and the equivalent Greek word Khri·stos (Christ) both mean “Anointed One.” Therefore, “Jesus Christ” means “Jesus the Anointed One,” or “Jesus the Messiah.”
In Bible times, a person was often anointed by having oil poured on his head when he was appointed to a special position of authority. (Leviticus 8:​12; 1 Samuel 16:13) Jesus was appointed by God to be the Messiah​—a position of great authority. (Acts 2:​36) However, rather than anointing Jesus with oil, God anointed him with holy spirit.​—Matthew 3:​16.
Could more than one person fulfill the Messianic prophecies?
No. Just as a fingerprint identifies just one person, the fulfillment of Bible prophecies points to just one Messiah, or Christ. However, the Bible warns that “false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.”​—Matthew 24:24.
Could the Messiah appear in the future?
No. The Bible foretold that the Messiah would be a descendant of King David of Israel. (Psalm 89:​3, 4) However, the Jewish ancestral records going back to David have been lost, apparently having been destroyed when the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 70 C.E.a Since that time, it has not been possible for anyone to prove that he is of the royal family of David. In contrast, though those ancestral records did exist in Jesus’ time, not even his enemies successfully challenged his claim of being a descendant of David.​—Matthew 22:41-​46.
How many Messianic prophecies are there in the Bible?
It is not possible to specify a definitive number of Messianic prophecies. For example, the method of numbering prophecies can vary even for passages that are clearly Messianic. The passage at Isaiah 53:​2-7 mentions several prophetic features regarding the Messiah. Some might count this entire passage as one prophecy, while others might view each feature as a separate prophecy.

a McClintock and Strong’s Cyclopedia states: “There can be little doubt that the registers of the Jewish tribes and families perished at the destruction of Jerusalem, and not before.”
b The Hebrew name Immanuel, meaning “With Us Is God,” well describes Jesus’ role as the Messiah. His presence on earth and his works proved that God is with His worshippers.​—Luke 2:​27-​32; 7:​12-​16.
c The term “Nazarene” apparently comes from the Hebrew word neʹtser, meaning “sprout.”
d For details on the Bible chronology pointing to 29 C.E. as the year of the Messiah’s arrival, see the article “How Daniel’s Prophecy Foretells the Messiah’s Arrival.”
e This prophecy is in the book of Zechariah, yet the Bible writer Matthew says that it “was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.” (Matthew 27:9) It appears that the book of Jeremiah was sometimes placed first in the section of Scripture called “the Prophets.” (Luke 24:44) Matthew apparently used “Jeremiah” to refer to that entire collection of books, which included the book of Zechariah.
