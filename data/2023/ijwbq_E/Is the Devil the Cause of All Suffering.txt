Is the Devil the Cause of All Suffering?


The Bible’s answer
The Bible reveals that Satan the Devil is a real person who, like a powerful criminal kingpin, sees to it that his will is accomplished through “lying signs” and “deception.” In fact, he “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light,” says the Bible. (2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10; 2 Corinthians 11:14) The Devil’s existence can be perceived by the damage he causes.
However, the Devil is not responsible for all suffering. Why not? God created humans with the capacity to choose between doing good and doing bad. (Joshua 24:15) When we make poor choices, we reap bad consequences.—Galatians 6:7, 8.
