<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Humans all have personal names. Wouldn’t it be reasonable for God to have a name? Having and using personal names is a vital part of human friendships. Should it be different when it comes to our friendship with God?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>In the Bible, God says: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:8</a>) Although he also has many titles, such as “God Almighty,” “Sovereign Lord,” and “Creator,” he honors his worshippers by inviting them to address him by his personal name.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:1-1:17:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 17:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:24-44:4:24" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 4:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:19-60:4:19" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 4:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Many translations of the Bible contain God’s personal name at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:3-2:6:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 6:3</a>. That passage says: “I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty, but as respects my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Jehovah is a rendering of God’s name in English that has been used for centuries. While many scholars prefer the spelling “Yahweh,” Jehovah is the form of the name that is most widely recognized. The first part of the Bible was written not in English but in Hebrew, a language that is read from right to left. In that language, the divine name appears as four consonants, יהוה. Those four Hebrew characters—transliterated YHWH—are known as the Tetragrammaton.</p>
