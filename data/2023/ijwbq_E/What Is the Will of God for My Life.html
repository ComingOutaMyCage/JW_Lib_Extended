<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>God’s will is that you come to know him as a Person, draw close to him, and then love and serve him with your whole heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37, 38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> James 4:8</a>) You can learn how to do God’s will from the life and teachings of Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:16-43:7:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 7:16, 17</a>) Jesus didn’t just talk about the will of God—he lived it. In fact, Jesus said that his purpose in life was “to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:38-43:6:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 6:38</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Do I need a special sign, vision, or calling to know what the will of God is for me?</strong></h3>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>No, because the Bible contains God’s message to mankind. It has what you need to be “completely equipped for every good work.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>) God wants you to use the Bible along with your “power of reason” to learn his will for you.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 12:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:17-49:5:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:17</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Can I really do God’s will?</strong></h3>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Yes, you can, for the Bible says: “God’s commands are not too hard for us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>, <em>Easy-to-Read Version</em>) That’s not to say that obeying God’s commands is always easy. But the benefits you will gain far outweigh the effort you must put forth. Jesus himself said: “How happy are those who hear the word of God and obey it!”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 11:28</a>, <em>Good News Translation</em>.</p>
