<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible does not give the date of Jesus’ birth, nor does it say that we should celebrate his birthday. As McClintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopedia</em> states: “The observance of Christmas is not of divine appointment, nor is it of NT [New Testament] origin.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Instead, an examination of the history of Christmas exposes its roots in pagan religious rites. The Bible shows that we offend God if we try to worship him in a way that he does not approve of.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:5-2:32:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 32:5-7</a>.</p>

<ol><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>              <strong>Celebrating Jesus’ birthday:</strong> “The early Christians did not celebrate [Jesus’] birth because they considered the celebration of anyone’s birth to be a pagan custom.”—<em>The World Book Encyclopedia</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>                <strong>December 25:</strong> There is no proof that Jesus was born on that date. Church leaders likely chose this date to coincide with pagan festivals held on or around the winter solstice.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>                 <strong>Gift-giving, feasting, partying:</strong> <em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> says: “Saturnalia, a Roman feast celebrated in mid-December, provided the model for many of the merry-making customs of Christmas. From this celebration, for example, were derived the elaborate feasting, the giving of gifts, and the burning of candles.” The <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> notes that “all work and business were suspended” during Saturnalia.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>                 <strong>Christmas lights:</strong> According to <em>The Encyclopedia of Religion</em>, Europeans decorated their homes “with lights and evergreens of all kinds” to celebrate the winter solstice and to combat evil spirits.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>                 <strong>Mistletoe, holly:</strong> “The Druids ascribed magical properties to the mistletoe in particular. The evergreen holly was worshiped as a promise of the sun’s return.”—<em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>                 <strong>Christmas tree:</strong> “Tree worship, common among the pagan Europeans, survived after their conversion to Christianity.” One of the ways in which tree worship survived is in the custom of “placing a Yule tree at an entrance or inside the house in the midwinter holidays.”​—<em>Encyclopædia Britannica.</em></p>
