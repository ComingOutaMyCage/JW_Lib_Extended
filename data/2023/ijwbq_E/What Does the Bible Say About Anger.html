<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible teaches that uncontrolled anger is harmful, both to the person who harbors it and to those around him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:22-20:29:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:22</a>) Although anger may be justified at times, the Bible says that those who continue to have “fits of anger” will not gain salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 5:​19-​21</a>) The Bible contains principles that can help a person deal with anger.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Is anger always wrong?</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>No. Anger may be justified in some cases. For example, the faithful man Nehemiah “became very angry” when he learned that some of his fellow worshippers were being oppressed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:6-16:5:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nehemiah 5:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>At times, God feels anger. For example, when his ancient people broke their agreement to worship only him and started to serve false gods, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against” them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:13-7:2:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judges 2:​13, 14</a>) Even so, anger is not a dominant aspect of Jehovah God’s personality. His anger is always justified and controlled.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:9-23:48:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isaiah 48:9</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>When is anger wrong?</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Anger is wrong when it is uncontrolled or unjustified, which is often the case with the anger displayed by imperfect humans. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  Cain “grew hot with anger” when God rejected his sacrifice. Cain allowed his anger to fester to the point that he murdered his brother.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:3-1:4:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 4:​3-8</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  The prophet Jonah “became hot with anger” when God showed mercy to the Ninevites. God corrected Jonah, pointing out that it was not “right for [him] to be so angry” and that he should have felt compassion for those repentant sinners.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:10-32:4:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jonah 3:⁠10–​4:​1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:4-32:4:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:11-32:4:11" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 11</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>These examples illustrate that for imperfect humans, “man’s anger does not bring about God’s righteousness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:20-59:1:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">James 1:​20</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>How can you deal with anger?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  <strong>Recognize the danger of uncontrolled anger.</strong> Some may think that unleashing their anger is a sign of strength. In reality, someone who cannot control his anger has a serious weakness. “As a city broken through, without a wall, is the man who cannot control his temper.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:28-20:25:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:11-20:29:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 29:11</a>) On the other hand, when we cultivate the ability to control our anger, we demonstrate true strength and discernment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:29-20:14:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:29</a>) The Bible says: “The one slow to anger is better than a mighty man.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:32</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  <strong>Deal with anger before it causes you to do something you will regret.</strong> “Let go of anger and abandon rage,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:8-19:37:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 37:8</a>, adding: “Do not become upset and turn to doing evil.” Notice that when we feel angry, we have a choice​—we can choose to let it go before we end up “doing evil.” As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:26-49:4:26" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:​26</a> says, “be wrathful, but do not sin.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  <strong>If possible, take your leave when anger starts to build.</strong> “Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate,” says the Bible. “Before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:14-20:17:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:14</a>) Although it is wise to settle differences with others quickly, both you and the other person may first need to cool down before you can discuss matters calmly.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><em> </em> <strong>Get the facts.</strong> “The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:11-20:19:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:11</a>. We are wise to gather all the facts before forming a conclusion. When we carefully listen to all sides of a matter, we are less likely to feel unjustified anger.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">James 1:​19</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em> </em> <strong>Pray for peace of mind.</strong> Prayer can help you experience “the peace of God that surpasses all understanding.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:7-50:4:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Philippians 4:7</a>) Prayer is one of the main ways we receive God’s holy spirit, which can produce in us such qualities as peace, patience, and self-control.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 11:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Galatians 5:​22, 23</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  <strong>Choose your associates carefully.</strong> We tend to become like the people we associate with. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) For good reason, the Bible warns: “Do not keep company with a hot-tempered man or get involved with one disposed to rage.” Why? “So that you never learn his ways and ensnare yourself.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:24-20:22:25" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:24, 25</a>.</p>
