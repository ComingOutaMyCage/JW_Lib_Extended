<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>God is able to see everything and to act anywhere he chooses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:3-20:15:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Hebrews 4:13</a>) However, the Bible does not teach that God is omnipresent​—that is, present everywhere, in all things. Instead, it shows that he is a person and that he resides in a dwelling place.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  <strong>God’s form:</strong> God is a spirit person. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 4:​24</a>) He is invisible to humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 1:​18</a>) Visions of God recorded in the Bible consistently portray him as having a distinct location. He is never depicted as existing everywhere.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:1-23:6:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:​1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:2-66:4:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:​2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:8-66:4:8" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>God’s dwelling place:</strong> God resides in the spirit realm<strong>,</strong> which is distinct from physical creation. Within that realm, God has a “dwelling place in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:30-11:8:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:​30</a>) The Bible mentions an occasion when spirit creatures “entered to take their station before Jehovah,”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> showing that in a sense, God resides at a specific location.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>If God is not omnipresent, can he really care for me personally?</strong></h3>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Yes. God cares deeply about individuals. Although he lives in the spirit realm, God notices those on earth who truly want to please him, and he acts in their behalf. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:39-11:8:39" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:​39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 16:9</a>) Consider how Jehovah demonstrates his concern for sincere worshippers:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>When you pray:</strong> Jehovah can hear your prayer the moment you say it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:18:31-14:18:31" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 18:31</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>When you are depressed:</strong> “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>When you need direction:</strong> Jehovah “will give you insight and instruct you” by means of his Word, the Bible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8</a>.</p>

<h3 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Misconceptions about omnipresence</strong></h3>
<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> God is present everywhere in creation.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> God dwells neither on the earth nor elsewhere in the physical universe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:27-11:8:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:​27</a>) It is true that the stars and other <a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:102014083/">creative works</a> “are declaring the glory of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 19:1</a>) However, God does not inhabit his creation any more than an artist lives in his painting. Still, a painting can tell us something about the artist who made it. Similarly, the visible world tells us about the Creator’s “invisible qualities,” such as his power, wisdom, and love.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 1:​20</a>.</p>
</div><div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> God must be omnipresent in order to know all things and be all-powerful.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> God’s holy spirit, or active force, is God’s power in action. Through his holy spirit, God can perceive and do anything, anywhere, at any time, without being present in person.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:7-19:139:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 139:7</a>.</p>
</div><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:8-19:139:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 139:8</a> teaches that God is omnipresent by saying: “If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there, and if I were to make my bed in the Grave, look! you would be there.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> This scripture is not talking about God’s location. It poetically teaches that no place is too remote for God to act in our behalf.</p>
