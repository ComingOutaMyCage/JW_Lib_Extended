<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>God can be seen directly by angels, though, because they are spirit creatures.

<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>How to “see” God now</strong></h2>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible often uses the idea of seeing figuratively, to represent enlightenment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:10-23:6:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:​10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:21-24:5:21" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 5:​21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:39-43:9:41" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> John 9:​39-​41</a>) In this sense, a person can see God now with “the eyes of [his] heart” by having faith so as to know Him and appreciate His qualities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:18-49:1:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:​18</a>) The Bible describes steps to build this kind of faith.</p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Did not Moses, Abraham, and others actually see God?</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>In accounts where it might seem that the Bible says that humans literally saw God, the context shows that God was represented by an <strong>angel</strong> or appeared by means of a <strong>vision.</strong></p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Angels.</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="13" class="p13"> In ancient times, God sent angels as his representatives to appear to humans and to speak in his name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:20-19:103:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 103:20</a>) For example, God once spoke to Moses from a burning bush, and the Bible says that “Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at the true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:4-2:3:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Exodus 3:​4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:6-2:3:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Moses did not literally see God, though, for the context shows that he actually saw “Jehovah’s angel.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:2-2:3:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 3:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Similarly, when the Bible says that God “spoke to Moses face-to-face,” it means that God conversed with Moses intimately. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:10-2:4:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Exodus 4:​10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:11-2:33:11" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 33:11</a>) Moses did not actually see God’s face, for the information he received from God “was transmitted through angels.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Galatians 3:​19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:53-44:7:53" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Acts 7:​53</a>) Still, Moses’ faith in God was so strong that the Bible described him as “seeing the One who is invisible.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:27-58:11:27" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>In the same way that he spoke to Moses, God communicated with Abraham through angels. Granted, a casual reading of the Bible might give the impression that Abraham literally saw God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:1-1:18:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 18:​1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:33-1:18:33" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 33</a>) However, the context shows that the “three men” who came to Abraham were actually angels sent by God. Abraham recognized them as God’s representatives and addressed them as if he were speaking directly to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:2-1:18:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 18:​2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:22-1:18:22" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:32-1:18:32" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:1-1:19:1" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> 19:1</a>.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Visions.</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="16" class="p16"> God has also appeared to humans through visions, or scenes presented to a person’s mind. For instance, when the Bible says that Moses and other Israelites “saw the God of Israel,” they really “saw a vision of the true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:9-2:24:11" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Exodus 24:​9-​11</a>) Likewise, the Bible sometimes says that prophets “saw Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:1-23:6:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:9" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Daniel 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:9:1-30:9:1" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Amos 9:1</a>) In each case, the context shows that they were given a vision of God rather than a direct view of him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:1-23:1:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:2-27:7:2" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Daniel 7:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:1-30:1:1" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Amos 1:1</a>.</p>
