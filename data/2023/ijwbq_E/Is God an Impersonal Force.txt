Is God an Impersonal Force?


The Bible’s answer
God exercises unsurpassed force throughout the universe. Regarding the way he created the countless billions of stars, the Bible says: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he [God] calls even by name. Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.”—Isaiah 40:25, 26.
But God is much more than a powerful force. The Bible says that he has feelings, such as love and hate. (Psalm 11:5; John 3:16) It also reveals that the way humans act can affect God’s emotions.—Psalm 78:40, 41.
