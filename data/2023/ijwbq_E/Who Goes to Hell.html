<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Hell (“Sheol” and “Hades” in the Bible’s original languages) is simply the grave, not a place of fiery torment. Who go to hell? Both good people and bad people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:13-18:14:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:17-19:9:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Psalm 9:​17</a>) The Bible says that this common grave of mankind is “the house of meeting for everyone living.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:30:23-18:30:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 30:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Even Jesus went to hell when he died. However, “he was not kept in hell,” because God resurrected him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:31-44:2:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 2:​31, 32</a>, <em>The Bible in Basic English.</em></p>
<h3 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Is hell eternal?</strong></h3>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>All those who go to hell will come back out, brought to life by Jesus through God’s power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 5:​28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>) Speaking of that future resurrection, the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:13-66:20:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 20:13</a> says that “death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them.” (<em>King James Version</em>) Once hell has been emptied, it will no longer exist; no one will ever go there again because “death will be no more.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 21:​3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:14-66:20:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 20:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Not everyone who dies goes to hell, though. The Bible shows that some people become so steeped in wickedness that they are beyond repentance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:26-58:10:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:26, 27</a>) When such ones die, they go, not to hell, but to Gehenna, which is a symbol of everlasting destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:29-40:5:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 5:​29, 30</a>) For example, Jesus indicated that some of the hypocritical religious leaders in his day would go to Gehenna.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:27-40:23:33" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 23:27-​33</a>.</p>
