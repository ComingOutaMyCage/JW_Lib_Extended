He said: “The Father is greater than I am.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:28-43:14:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 14:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Jesus’ early followers did not view him as being equal to Almighty God. For example, the apostle Paul wrote that after Jesus was resurrected, God “exalted him [Jesus] to a superior position.” Obviously, Paul did not believe that Jesus was Almighty God. Otherwise, how could God exalt Jesus to a superior position? —<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Philippians 2:9</a>.</p>
