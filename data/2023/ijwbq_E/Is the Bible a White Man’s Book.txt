Is the Bible a White Man’s Book?


The Bible’s answer
The Bible wasn’t written by Europeans. All of the men that God used to write the Bible were from Asia. The Bible doesn’t promote one race as being superior to another. In fact, it states: “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.”—Acts 10:34, 35.
