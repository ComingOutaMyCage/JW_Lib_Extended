<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“New Jerusalem,” an expression that appears twice in the Bible, is a symbolic city that represents the group of Jesus’ followers who go to heaven to rule with him in God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:12-66:3:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 3:​12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 21:2</a>) The Bible shows that this group can also be called the bride of Christ.</p>
<h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Keys to identifying New Jerusalem</strong></h2>
<ol><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>              <strong>New Jerusalem is in heaven.</strong> Each time the Bible mentions New Jerusalem, it is said to come down from heaven, where angels guard the city’s gates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:12-66:3:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 3:​12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 21:​2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:10-66:21:10" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:12-66:21:12" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 12</a>) Also, the city’s great size proves that it could not be on earth. It is a cube measuring “12,000 stadia,” or “furlongs,” around.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:16-66:21:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 21:16</a>; <em>King James Version</em>) Its sides would thus be almost 560 kilometers (350 mi) high, extending into space.</p>

<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>                <strong>New Jerusalem is made up of a group of Jesus’ followers, the bride of Christ.</strong> New Jerusalem is called “the bride, the Lamb’s wife.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:​9, 10</a>) In this symbolic description, the Lamb refers to Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 1:​29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:12-66:5:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Revelation 5:​12</a>) “The Lamb’s wife,” Christ’s bride, represents Christians who will be united with Jesus in heaven. The Bible likens the relationship between Jesus and these Christians to that of a husband and wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:2-47:11:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:23-49:5:25" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:​23-​25</a>) In addition, the foundation stones of New Jerusalem are inscribed with “the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:14-66:21:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 21:14</a>) This detail helps to confirm the identity of New Jerusalem, since Christians who are called to life in heaven are “built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:​20</a>.</p>

<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>               <strong>New Jerusalem is part of a government.</strong> Ancient Jerusalem was the capital of Israel, the place where King David, his son Solomon, and their descendants ruled “on Jehovah’s throne.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>) Jerusalem, called “the holy city,” thus represented God’s rulership in the family line of David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:1-16:11:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nehemiah 11:1</a>) New Jerusalem, also called “the holy city,” is made up of those who join Jesus in heaven “to rule as kings over the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 5:​9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 21:2</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2</a>) This expression links New Jerusalem with <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012120/">God’s Kingdom</a>, which God uses to accomplish his will “as in heaven, also on earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 6:​10</a>) God’s purpose for people on earth includes these blessings:</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:2-23:59:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 59:2</a>) The removal of sin will allow for the complete fulfillment of this prophecy: “The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people.
