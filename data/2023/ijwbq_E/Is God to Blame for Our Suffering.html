<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible emphatically answers no! Suffering was not part of Jehovah God’s purpose for mankind. However, the first human couple rebelled against God’s rulership, choosing to set their own standards of good and bad. They turned away from God and suffered the consequences.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Today we are experiencing the effects of their bad choice. But in no way did <em>God</em> originate human suffering.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible says: “When under trial, let no one say: ‘I am being tried by God.’ For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:13-59:1:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 1:13</a>) Suffering can afflict anyone—even those who are favored by God.</p>
