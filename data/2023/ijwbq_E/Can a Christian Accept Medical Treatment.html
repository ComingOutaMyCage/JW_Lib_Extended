<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes. Jesus implied that his followers could seek medical treatment when he said that “persons in health do not need a physician, but the ailing do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:12-40:9:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 9:12</a>) Although the Bible is not a medical manual, it does provide principles to guide those who want to please God.</p>
<h3 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Questions to ask yourself</strong></h3>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>1.</strong> Do I understand the proposed treatment? The Bible advises that we search for reliable information rather than put “faith in every word.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>2.</strong> Should I get a second or a third medical opinion? A “multitude of counselors” can be valuable, especially if your condition is serious.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:22-20:15:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>3.</strong> Does the treatment involve a violation of the Bible command to “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502013147/">abstain . . . from blood</a>”?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:20-44:15:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 15:20</a>. </p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>4.</strong> Is spiritism used in the diagnosis or treatment? The Bible condemns the “practice of spiritism.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>) To determine if spiritism is involved, consider questions such as these:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Does the practitioner employ spiritism?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Is the treatment based on the belief that sickness is caused by offended gods or enemies who use witchcraft?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Are sacrifices, incantations, or other spiritistic rituals or objects employed in preparing or using the medicine?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>5.</strong> Am I becoming obsessed with my health? The Bible counsels: “Let your reasonableness become known to all men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:5-50:4:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 4:5</a>) <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502013105/">Being reasonable</a> will help you to focus on “the more important things,” such as spiritual matters.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Philippians 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matthew 5:3</a>.</p>
