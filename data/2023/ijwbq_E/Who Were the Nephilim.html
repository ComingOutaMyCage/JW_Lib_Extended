<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> Their fathers are called “sons of the true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:2-1:6:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 6:2</a>) The Bible uses this same expression to describe angels.

After the angels “began taking as wives all whom they chose,” Jehovah said that in 120 years he would take action against the ungodly world of that time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 6:​1-3</a>) The account adds that “in those days,” the materialized angels “continued to have relations with the daughters of men” and that they produced “the mighty ones of old times,” the Nephilim.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:4-1:6:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 6:4</a>.</p>
