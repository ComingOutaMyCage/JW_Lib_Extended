<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>There are some prayers that God does not answer. Consider two factors that would cause God to ignore a person’s prayer.</p>
<h3 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. The prayer goes against God’s will</strong></h3>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>God does not answer requests that go against his will, or his requirements, which are in the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 5:14</a>) For example, the Bible requires that we avoid being greedy. Gambling promotes greed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:​9, 10</a>) So, God will not answer your prayer if you pray to win the lottery. God is not a genie that you can summon to do your bidding. Actually, you can be thankful for this. Otherwise, you might have to fear what others could ask God to do.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:3-59:4:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 4:3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2. The person praying acts rebelliously</strong></h3>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>God does not listen to those who are determined to offend him by their actions. For example, God told those who claimed to serve him but acted rebelliously: “Even though you make many prayers, I am not listening; with bloodshed your very hands have become filled.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:15-23:1:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:15</a>) But if they had changed their ways and “set matters straight” with God, he would have listened when they prayed to him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:18</a>.</p>
