<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The Bible’s answer</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible says that Jesus “was put to death in the flesh but made alive [resurrected] in the spirit.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:​18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:34-44:13:34" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 13:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:45-46:15:45" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:16-47:5:16" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 5:​16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Jesus’ own words showed that he would not be resurrected with his flesh-and-blood body. He said that he would give his “flesh in behalf of the life of the world,” as a ransom for mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:51-43:6:51" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 6:​51;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matthew 20:28</a>) If he had taken back his flesh when he was resurrected, he would have canceled that ransom sacrifice. This could not have happened, though, for the Bible says that he sacrificed his flesh and blood “once for all time.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:11-58:9:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:​11, 12</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>If Jesus was raised up with a spirit body, how could his disciples see him?</strong></h3>
<ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Spirit creatures can take on human form. For example, angels who did this in the past even ate and drank with humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:1-1:18:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 18:​1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:1-1:19:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19:​1-3</a>) However, they still were spirit creatures and could leave the physical realm.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:15-7:13:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Judges 13:15-​21</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>After his resurrection, Jesus also assumed human form temporarily, just as angels had previously done. As a spirit creature, though, he was able to appear and disappear suddenly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:31-42:24:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 24:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:19-43:20:19" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> John 20:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:26-43:20:26" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 26</a>) The fleshly bodies that he materialized were not identical from one appearance to the next. Thus, even Jesus’ close friends recognized him only by what he said or did.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:30-42:24:31" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 24:30, 31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:35-42:24:35" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:14-43:20:16" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> John 20:14-​16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:6-43:21:7" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 21:​6, 7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>When Jesus appeared to the apostle Thomas, he took on a body with wound marks. He did this to bolster Thomas’ faith, since Thomas doubted that Jesus had been raised up.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:24-43:20:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 20:24-​29</a>.</p>
