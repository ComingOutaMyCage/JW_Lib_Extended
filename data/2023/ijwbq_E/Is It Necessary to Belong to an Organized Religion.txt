Is It Necessary to Belong to an Organized Religion?


The Bible’s answer
Yes, because God wants people to gather for worship. The Bible says: “Let us consider one another so as to motivate to love and fine works, not forsaking our meeting together.”​—Hebrews 10:24, 25, footnote.
Jesus indicated that his followers would form an organized group when he said to them: “By this all will know that you are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35) As a primary way of showing this love, disciples of Christ would associate with fellow believers. They would be organized into congregations that meet regularly for worship. (1 Corinthians 16:19) Collectively, they would form a worldwide brotherhood.​—1 Peter 2:​17.
More is needed than just belonging to a religion
While the Bible shows that people should gather to worship God, it does not teach that a person can please God by just being a member of a religion. To be approved by God, a person’s religion must affect his everyday life. For example, the Bible says: “The religion that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.”​—James 1:​27, footnote.
