Day of Atonement




The most important holy day for the Israelites, also called Yom Kippur (from Hebrew yohm hak·kip·pu·rimʹ, “day of the coverings”), held on Ethanim 10. This was the only day of the year on which the high priest went into the Most Holy of the tabernacle and later of the temple. There he offered the blood of the sacrifices for his sins, the sins of the other Levites, and the sins of the people. It was a time of holy convention and fasting, and it was also a sabbath, a time to abstain from regular work.​—Le 23:27, 28.
