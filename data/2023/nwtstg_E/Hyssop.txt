Hyssop




A plant with fine branches and leaves, used for sprinkling blood or water in cleansing ceremonies. It was possibly marjoram (Origanum maru; Origanum syriacum). As used at John 19:29, it may have been marjoram attached to a branch or durra, a variety of common sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), since this plant could have provided a stalk long enough to carry the sponge of sour wine to Jesus’ mouth.​—Ex 12:22; Ps 51:7.
