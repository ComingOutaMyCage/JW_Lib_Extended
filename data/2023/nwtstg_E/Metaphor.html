<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A figure of speech that highlights a similarity between two different things by stating that one thing <em>is</em> another.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A metaphor, like other word pictures, can be understood by identifying three elements: <strong>the topic</strong> that is being discussed, <strong>the image</strong> or concept that the topic is compared with, and <strong>the specific point of similarity</strong> between the two things being compared.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible uses many metaphors. For example, Jesus used a metaphor when he said to his followers: “You are the salt of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:13-40:5:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 5:13</a>) In this word picture, the <strong>topic</strong> is “you,” that is, Jesus’ followers. The <strong>image</strong> is “salt.” The <strong>point of similarity</strong> in this context is the preservative quality of salt. The lesson? Just as salt could preserve food by preventing decay, the disciples could preserve the moral purity of people by teaching them the things Jesus commanded. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="32" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/5:13">study note on Mt 5:13</a>.) Some other metaphors used in the Bible can be found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:2-19:18:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 18:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:11-19:84:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 84:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:121:5-19:121:5" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 121:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:7-43:10:7" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Joh 10:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:1-43:15:1" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 15:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A related figure of speech is a simile. Similes are less forceful than metaphors. They state that one thing is <em>like</em> another. Examples of similes can be found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:17-1:22:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 22:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:3-19:1:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:9-19:10:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 10:9</a>.</p>
