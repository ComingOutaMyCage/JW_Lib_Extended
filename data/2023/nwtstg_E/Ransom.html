<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A price paid to provide a release from captivity, punishment, suffering, sin, or even an obligation. The price was not always monetary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:3-23:43:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 43:3</a>) A ransom was required in a number of different situations. For example, all firstborn boys or male animals in Israel belonged to Jehovah, and a ransom, or redemption price, needed to be paid to release them from exclusive use in Jehovah’s service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:45-4:3:46" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 3:45, 46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:15-4:18:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18:15, 16</a>) If an unguarded, dangerous bull killed someone, a ransom was imposed on its owner in order to release him from the prescribed death sentence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:29-2:21:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 21:29, 30</a>) However, no ransom was accepted for a willful murderer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:31-4:35:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nu 35:31</a>) Most important, the Bible highlights the ransom that Christ paid by his sacrificial death in order to release obedient humankind from sin and death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:49:7-19:49:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 49:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Mt 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Eph 1:7</a>.</p>
