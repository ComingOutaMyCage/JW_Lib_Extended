<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A term of uncertain meaning appearing in the superscriptions of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:39:0-19:39:0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalms 39</a>, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:0-19:62:0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">62</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:77:0-19:77:0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">77</a>. These superscriptions appear to be instructions for the performance of the psalm, perhaps identifying a style or a musical instrument. There was a Levitical musician named Jeduthun, so this performance style or instrument may have been associated with him or his sons.</p>
