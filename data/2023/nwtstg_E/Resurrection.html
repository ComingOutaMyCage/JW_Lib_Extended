The Greek word <em>a·naʹsta·sis</em> literally means “raising up; standing up.” Nine resurrections are mentioned in the Bible, including the resurrection of Jesus by Jehovah God. Although other resurrections were performed through Elijah, Elisha, Jesus, Peter, and Paul, these miracles are clearly attributed to God’s power. The earthly resurrection of “both the righteous and the unrighteous” is essential to God’s purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 24:15</a>) The Bible also mentions a heavenly resurrection, termed “the earlier” or “the first” resurrection, involving the spirit-anointed brothers of Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:11-50:3:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Php 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:5-66:20:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Re 20:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Joh 5:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:25-43:11:25" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 11:25</a>.</p>
