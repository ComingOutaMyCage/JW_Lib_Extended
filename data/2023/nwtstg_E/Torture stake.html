<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The rendering of the Greek word <em>stau·rosʹ,</em> meaning an upright stake or pole, such as the one on which Jesus was executed. There is no evidence that the Greek word meant a cross, such as the pagans used as a religious symbol for many centuries before Christ. <em>“Torture</em> stake” conveys the full intent of the original word, since the word <em>stau·rosʹ</em> is also used to indicate the torture, suffering, and shame that Jesus’ followers would face.
