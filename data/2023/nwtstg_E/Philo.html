<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(c. 20-10 B.C.E.–c. 50 C.E.) A Jewish writer and philosopher who lived in Alexandria, Egypt. He was often called Philo of Alexandria, but he was also known as Philo Judaeus because of his Jewish background.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Philo was Greek-speaking, as were many Jews living in Egypt at that time. He used the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> version of the Hebrew Scriptures as the basis for his Biblical studies. His use of certain Greek terms that are also found in the Christian Greek Scriptures may shed light on their meaning and can therefore be of interest to Bible students.—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="33" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/19:28">study note on Mt 19:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Philo believed that Judaism was the only true religion, and he sought to lead Gentiles to God by making Judaism acceptable to them. However, he mixed Scripture with Greek philosophy, such as that of Plato. Philo defended the existence of God. At the same time, he claimed that God “has no distinctive qualities” and that God “is incomprehensible,” so calling him by a personal name is impossible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Philo’s writings were among the influences that led many nominal Christians to adopt the unscriptural doctrine of the immortality of the soul. Moreover, Philo’s teaching on the Logos (or, the Word) contributed to the development of the non-Biblical teaching of the Trinity.</p>
