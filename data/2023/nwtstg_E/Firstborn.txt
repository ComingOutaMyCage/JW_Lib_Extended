Firstborn




Primarily, the oldest son of a father (rather than the firstborn of the mother). In Bible times, the firstborn son held an honored position in the family and was given the headship of the household when the father died. The term also refers to the first male offspring of animals, at times called “firstlings.”​—Ex 11:5; 13:12; Ge 25:33; Col 1:15.
