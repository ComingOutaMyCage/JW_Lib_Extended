<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A bar borne upon a person’s shoulders, from each side of which loads were suspended, or a wooden bar or frame placed over the necks of two draft animals (usually cattle) when pulling a farm implement or a wagon. Because slaves often used yokes to carry heavy burdens, the yoke was used figuratively to represent enslavement or subjection to another person, as well as oppression and suffering. Removing or breaking the yoke signified liberation from bondage, oppression, and exploitation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:13-3:26:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 26:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:29-40:11:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mt 11:29, 30</a>.</p>
