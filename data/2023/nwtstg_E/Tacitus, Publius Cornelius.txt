Tacitus, Publius Cornelius




(c. 56–c. 120 C.E.) A Roman orator and public official, often regarded as the greatest historian of ancient Rome.
Tacitus’ most famous works are his Histories (c. 104-109 C.E.) and his Annals (c. 115-117 C.E.), which together document the history of the Roman Empire from 14 to 96 C.E. Considered a moralist, Tacitus condemned the Roman despots for their corruption and their abuse of power. For example, even though Tacitus had little regard for Christians, he recorded Nero’s brutality toward them, which included making them scapegoats for the great fire in Rome, which occurred in 64 C.E.
Tacitus’ writings often refer to specific individuals mentioned in the Bible. These include Quirinius, Roman governor of Syria; Felix, procurator of Judea; and Pontius Pilate, who had Christ executed during the reign of Tiberius Caesar. All these references provide support for the Bible record.—Mt 27:2; Lu 2:1, 2; 3:1; Ac 23:24, 26.
