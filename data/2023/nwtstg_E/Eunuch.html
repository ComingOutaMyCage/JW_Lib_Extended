<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In a literal sense, a castrated male. Such men were often appointed in royal courts as attendants or caretakers of the queen and the concubines. The term also refers to a man who was, not a literal eunuch, but an official assigned to duties in the court of the king. It is used figuratively for a ‘eunuch for the Kingdom,’ one who exercises self-control so as to apply himself more fully to the service of God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:12-40:19:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 19:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:15-17:2:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Es 2:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:27-44:8:27" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ac 8:27</a>.</p>
