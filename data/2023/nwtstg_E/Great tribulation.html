<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Greek word for “tribulation” conveys the idea of distress or suffering resulting from the pressures of circumstances. Jesus spoke of an unprecedented “great tribulation” that would come upon Jerusalem and especially of one that would later befall mankind in connection with his future ‘coming with glory.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 24:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:31" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 29-31</a>) Paul described this tribulation as a righteous act of God against “those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news” about Jesus Christ. Revelation chapter 19 shows Jesus as the one leading heavenly armies against “the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:6-53:1:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Th 1:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Re 19:11-21</a>) “A great crowd” is shown as surviving that tribulation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Re 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14</a>)​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077026/">ARMAGEDDON</a>.</p>
