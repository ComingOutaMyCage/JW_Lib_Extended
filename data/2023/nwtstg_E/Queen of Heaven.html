<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The title of a goddess worshipped by apostate Israelites in the days of Jeremiah. Some suggest that it refers to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar (Astarte). The name of her earlier Sumerian counterpart, Inanna, means “Queen of Heaven.” Besides being associated with the heavens, she was a fertility goddess. Astarte is also called “Lady of Heaven” in an Egyptian inscription.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:44:19-24:44:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 44:19</a>.</p>
