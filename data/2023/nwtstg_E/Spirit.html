<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>ruʹach</em> and the Greek word <em>pneuʹma,</em> often translated “spirit,” have a number of meanings. All of them refer to that which is invisible to human sight and gives evidence of force in motion. The Hebrew and Greek words are used with reference to (1) wind, (2) the active life-force in earthly creatures, (3) the impelling force that issues from a person’s figurative heart and causes him to say and do things in a certain way, (4) inspired expressions originating from an invisible source, (5) spirit persons, and (6) God’s active force, or holy spirit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:21-2:35:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 35:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:29-19:104:29" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps 104:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:43-40:12:43" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Mt 12:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Lu 11:13</a>.</p>
