<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A Greek word with the central idea of that which is agreeable and winsome. The word is often used to refer to a kind gift or a kind manner of giving. When referring to the undeserved kindness of God, the word describes a free gift given generously by God, with no expectation of repayment. Thus, it is an expression of God’s bounteous giving and generous love and kindness toward humans. The Greek term is also rendered by such expressions as “favor” and “kind gift.” It is given unearned and unmerited, motivated solely by the generosity of the giver.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:1-47:6:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Co 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Eph 1:7</a>.</p>
