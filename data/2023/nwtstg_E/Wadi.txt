Wadi




The valley or bed of a stream that is usually dry except during the rainy season; the word may also refer to the stream itself. Some streams were fed by springs and were therefore perennial. The wadi is referred to as “valley” in some contexts.​—Ge 26:19; Nu 34:5; De 8:7; 1Ki 18:5; Job 6:15.
