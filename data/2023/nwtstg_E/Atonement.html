Those sacrifices pointed to Jesus’ sacrifice, which completely atoned for mankind’s sins once for all time, giving people the opportunity to be reconciled to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:10-3:5:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 5:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:28-3:23:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 23:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:20-51:1:20" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Col 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:12-58:9:12" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Heb 9:12</a>.</p>
