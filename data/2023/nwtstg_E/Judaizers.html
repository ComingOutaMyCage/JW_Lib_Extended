<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A term that usually refers to first-century Jews who claimed to be Christians but who still advocated adherence to the Mosaic Law and Jewish customs and traditions. They laid special stress on circumcision.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With their teachings, the Judaizers limited Christian freedom and caused divisions in the first-century Christian congregation. The apostle Paul counteracted their teachings, especially in his letter to the Galatians, where he refers to certain Judaizers as “false brothers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:7-48:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ga 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:4-48:2:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:9-48:4:10" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 4:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:12-48:6:13" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 6:12, 13</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:1-44:15:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 15:1, 2</a>.) The “superfine apostles” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:5-47:11:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:13-47:11:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 13</a> may also have advocated such views. The influence of Judaizers seems to have persisted for a number of years; Paul continued to deal with their ideas in his later letters.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:11-51:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Col 2:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:16-51:2:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:10-56:1:11" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Tit 1:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While the word “Judaizers” does not appear in the Christian Greek Scriptures, the term is found in the writings of first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> II, 463 [xviii, 2]) Paul used a related Greek term in his letter to the Galatians. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:11-48:2:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 2:11-14</a>, he described how he corrected Peter at Antioch of Syria for refusing to eat with Christians from a non-Jewish background. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:14-48:2:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Verse 14</a> uses the Greek verb <em>I·ou·da·iʹzo</em> together with the Greek verb for “compel” in the expression “compel . . . <em>to live according to Jewish practice.”</em></p>
