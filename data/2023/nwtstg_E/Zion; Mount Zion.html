<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The name of the Jebusite fortress city of Jebus that was on the southeast hill of Jerusalem. After David captured it, he built his royal residence there, and it came to be called “the City of David.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:7-10:5:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 5:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:9-10:5:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Zion became a mountain especially holy to Jehovah when David had the Ark transferred there. Later, the name included the temple area on Mount Moriah, and at times the entire city of Jerusalem. It is often used symbolically in the Christian Greek Scriptures.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:6-19:2:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:6-60:2:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1Pe 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Re 14:1</a>.</p>
