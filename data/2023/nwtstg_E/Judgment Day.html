<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A specific day, or period, when particular groups, nations, or mankind in general are called to account by God. It may be a time when those judged to be deserving of death are executed, or the judgment may afford opportunity for some to be saved and gain everlasting life. Jesus Christ and his apostles pointed to a future “Judgment Day” involving not only the living but also those who died in the past.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:36-40:12:36" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 12:36</a>.</p>
