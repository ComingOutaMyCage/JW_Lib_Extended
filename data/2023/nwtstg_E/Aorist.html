<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A verb form in Biblical Greek that, though called a tense, usually conveys the <em>kind</em> of action taken rather than the <em>time</em> when the action takes place. Verbs in the aorist tense may be rendered in a variety of ways according to their context. For example, the aorist may denote a single action or actions that are momentary rather than an action or actions that are habitual or continuous.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 2:1</a>, the aorist tense of the Greek verb “to sin” is rendered “commit a sin.” The aorist here evidently expresses momentary action, referring to just one act of sin. The present tense of a Greek verb, by comparison, often denotes ongoing action. For example, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:6-62:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 3:6</a>, the present tense of the same verb is rendered “practice sin.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:9-40:4:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 4:9</a>, the use of the aorist evidently indicates that Satan asked Jesus to “do <em>an act</em> of worship” to him, not to offer continuous worship.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A command may also be in the aorist. Unlike a prohibition in the present tense, which may often denote a command to stop doing something (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:10-42:5:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lu 5:​10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:28-42:23:28" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 23:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:16-43:2:16" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Joh 2:​16</a>), a prohibition in the aorist could be understood as a command against doing something at any given time or moment. One example is recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:​34</a>: “Never be anxious about the next day.” Here the aorist conveys the idea of not being anxious at any given time or moment.</p>
