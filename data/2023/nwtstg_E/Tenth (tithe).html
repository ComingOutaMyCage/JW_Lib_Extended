<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A tenth part, or 10 percent, given or paid as a tribute, especially for religious purposes. It is also called a “tithe,” and giving it is called “tithing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:10-39:3:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mal 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:26:12-5:26:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 26:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:23-40:23:23" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Mt 23:23</a>) Under the Mosaic Law, a tenth of the produce of the land and a tenth of the increase of the herds and flocks were given to the Levites yearly to support them. The Levites gave a tenth of this tenth to the Aaronic priesthood to support them. There were some additional tithes as well. Tithing is not required of Christians.</p>
