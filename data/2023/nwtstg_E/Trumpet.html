<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A wind instrument made of metal, used for signaling and for music. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:2-4:10:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 10:2</a>, Jehovah gave instructions for making two silver trumpets that would be used to sound specific signals for summoning the assembly, for breaking camp, or for proclaiming war. These likely were straight trumpets, unlike the curved “horns” that were actually made from animal horns. Trumpets of unspecified construction were also included among the musical instruments at the temple. The sound of trumpets often symbolically accompanies the proclamation of Jehovah’s judgments or other significant events of divine origin.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:29:26-14:29:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ch 29:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:10-15:3:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ezr 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:52-46:15:52" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1Co 15:52;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:8:7-66:11:15" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Re 8:7–11:15</a>.</p>
