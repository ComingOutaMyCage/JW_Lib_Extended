<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A word taken from the Hebrew for “One Singled Out,” “Dedicated One,” “Separated One.” There were two classes of Nazirites: those who volunteered and those who were appointed as such by God. A man or a woman could take a special vow to Jehovah to live as a Nazirite for a period of time. Those voluntarily taking the vow had three principal restrictions: they were to drink no alcohol nor eat any product of the grapevine, they were not to cut their hair, and they were not to touch a dead body. Those appointed by God as Nazirites remained such for life, and Jehovah specified the requirements for them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:6:2-4:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 6:2-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:5-7:13:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jg 13:5</a>.</p>
