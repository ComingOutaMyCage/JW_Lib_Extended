<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A group of Greek cities, originally made up of ten cities (from Greek <em>deʹka,</em> meaning “ten,” and <em>poʹlis,</em> “city”). It was also the name for the region east of the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River, where most of these cities were located. They were centers of Hellenistic culture and trade. Jesus passed through this region, but there is no record of his having visited any of the cities.
