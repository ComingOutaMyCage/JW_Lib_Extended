<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The annual festival celebrated on the 14th and 15th of Adar. It commemorates the Jews’ deliverance from destruction in Queen Esther’s time. The non-Hebrew word <em>pu·rimʹ</em> means “lots.” The Festival of Purim, or Festival of Lots, was so named from the act of Haman in casting Pur (the Lot) to determine the day to carry out his extermination plot against the Jews.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:7-17:3:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Es 3:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:9:26-17:9:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9:26</a>.</p>
