Elder; Older man




A man of mature age, but in the Scriptures, one who primarily holds a position of authority and responsibility in a community or a nation. The word is also used of heavenly creatures in the book of Revelation. The Greek word pre·sbyʹte·ros is translated “elder” when it refers to those responsible for taking the lead in the congregation.​—Ex 4:29; Pr 31:23; 1Ti 5:17; Re 4:4.
