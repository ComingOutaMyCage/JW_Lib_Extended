<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A question, not intended to elicit an audible answer, but designed to stimulate thinking, add emphasis, make an important point, or move listeners to reason on a matter.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A powerful teaching aid, rhetorical questions are often used in the Bible. Jehovah employed them when reproving his ancient people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:18-23:40:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 40:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:21-23:40:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:25-23:40:25" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:14-24:18:14" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Jer 18:14</a>) Jesus asked rhetorical questions to emphasize important truths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:11-42:11:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 11:11-13</a>) He also used them to get people to think, sometimes even asking a series of such questions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:7-40:11:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 11:7-9</a>) The apostle Paul likewise made excellent use of rhetorical questions.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:31-45:8:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ro 8:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:13-46:1:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Co 1:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:22-46:11:22" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 11:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When a Bible reader encounters a rhetorical question, it is good to pause and try to determine the intended point of the question. For example, when Jesus asked: “Which one of you, if his son asks for bread, will hand him a stone?” the intended answer is: “It would be unthinkable for a father to do such a thing.”—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="34" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/7:9">study note on Mt 7:9</a>.</p>
