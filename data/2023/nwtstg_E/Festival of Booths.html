It celebrated the harvest at the end of the agricultural year for Israel and was a time of rejoicing and thanksgiving for Jehovah’s blessings on their crops. During the days of the festival, people lived in booths, or rooflike shelters, to remind them of the Exodus from Egypt. It was one of the three festivals that males were required to go to Jerusalem to observe.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:34-3:23:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 23:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:4-15:3:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ezr 3:4</a>.</p>
