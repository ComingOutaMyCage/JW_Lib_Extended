World




In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the term “world” is a rendering of the Greek word koʹsmos. The basic meaning of this Greek word is “order” or “arrangement,” and it originally referred to “the process of getting various items to fit together, or to the result of such a process,” as one scholar expresses it. So koʹsmos could be used to describe the arranging of soldiers for a battle, the preparation of a meal, or the composition of a song. Moreover, since order and symmetry are often connected with beauty, koʹsmos was also used by Greeks to mean “adornment,” especially the adornment of women. (1Pe 3:3) The English word “cosmetic” comes from this Greek word. As noted by ancient Greek writers, the word came to be applied to the universe. (Compare Ac 17:24 [and study note], where Paul possibly used the term in this sense.) Still later, this word was used to refer to humanity.
In the Christian Greek Scriptures, koʹsmos is primarily linked to the world of mankind. In various contexts, it is used to mean: (1) Humankind as a whole, no matter what the moral condition or course of life might be. (Mt 5:14; 26:13; Joh 3:16 and study note; Ro 5:12; 1Jo 4:14) (2) The organized human society, or sphere of human life and circumstances, into which a person is born and in which he lives. (Lu 9:25 and study note; Joh 16:21 and study note; 1Ti 6:7; Jas 2:5; 1Jo 3:17) (In this sense, koʹsmos is at times quite similar to the Greek word ai·onʹ, “system of things.” See SYSTEM(S) OF THINGS.) (3) The world of mankind apart from Jehovah’s approved servants; the unrighteous human society that is alienated from God. (Mt 4:8; Joh 15:19 and study note; 17:14 and study note; 1Co 2:12 and study note; Heb 11:7; 2Pe 2:5; 3:6; 1Jo 5:19) In all these cases, koʹsmos still retains its basic sense of “order” or “arrangement,” since the world of mankind reflects a certain structure, being composed of various cultures, tribes, nations, and economic systems.​—Re 7:9; 14:6.
