<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A round stone placed on top of a similar stone and used to grind grain into flour. A peg that was fitted into the center of the lower stone served as a pivot for the upper stone. In Bible times, hand mills operated by the women were used in most homes. Since a family’s daily bread depended on the hand mill, the Mosaic Law forbade confiscating it or its upper grindstone as security. Larger mills of a similar construction were turned by animals.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:6-5:24:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 24:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:42-41:9:42" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mr 9:42</a>.</p>
