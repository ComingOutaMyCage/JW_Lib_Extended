<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A compound of aromatic gums and balsams that burns slowly, giving off a fragrant aroma. A special four-ingredient incense was made for use at the tabernacle and the temple. It was burned morning and night on the altar of incense in the Holy compartment, and on the Day of Atonement, it was burned inside the Most Holy compartment. It was symbolic of the acceptable prayers of God’s faithful servants. Its use was not required of Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:34-2:30:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 30:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:13-3:16:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Le 16:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:8-66:5:8" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Re 5:8</a>.</p>
