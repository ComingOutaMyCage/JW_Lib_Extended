Firstfruits




The earliest fruits of a harvest season; the first results or products of anything. Jehovah required the nation of Israel to offer their firstfruits to him, whether it be of man, animal, or the fruitage of the ground. As a nation, the Israelites offered firstfruits to God at the Festival of Unleavened Bread and at Pentecost. The term “firstfruits” was also used figuratively of Christ and his anointed followers.​—1Co 15:23; Nu 15:21; Pr 3:9; Re 14:4.
