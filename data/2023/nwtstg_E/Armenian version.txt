Armenian version




The Armenian-language version of the Bible was produced as early as the fifth century C.E. when the Armenian alphabet was created. That translation, which includes both the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures, is a source that scholars can consult when they compare the readings of different Bible manuscripts.​—See study note on Mr 16:8.
The source texts used as the basis for the first Armenian translations of the Bible may have been Greek or Syriac or possibly both languages. Traces of the earliest translations appear as quotations in other ancient sources, such as the writings of the so-called Church Fathers. However, manuscripts of the Armenian version that date to the ninth century C.E. are available today. In fact, there are more manuscripts of the Armenian version of the Christian Greek Scriptures in existence than of any other early translation except for the Latin Vulgate.
