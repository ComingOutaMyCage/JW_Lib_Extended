<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the Christian Greek Scriptures, a prisonlike abased condition into which the disobedient angels of Noah’s day were cast. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:4-61:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:4</a>, the use of the verb <em>tar·ta·roʹo</em> (to “cast into Tartarus”) does not signify that “the angels who sinned” were cast into the pagan mythological Tartarus (that is, an underground prison and place of darkness for the lesser gods). Rather, it indicates that they were abased by God from their heavenly place and privileges and were delivered over to a condition of deepest mental darkness respecting God’s bright purposes. Darkness also marks their own eventuality, which the Scriptures show is everlasting destruction along with their ruler, Satan the Devil. Therefore, Tartarus denotes the lowest condition of abasement for those rebellious angels. It is not the same as “the abyss” spoken of at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:1-66:20:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 20:1-3</a>.</p>
