Christian Greek Scriptures




A designation for the last 27 books of the Bible, commonly called the New Testament. The books were written by eight Jewish Christians: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, James, Peter, and Jude. (Ro 3:1, 2) Matthew apparently wrote his account in Hebrew and translated it into Greek. His translation and the rest of the books were written in Koine, or common Greek. (Thus the designation “Greek Scriptures.”) “Christian” refers to the contents of the books, which include information about the life, ministry, and teachings of Jesus Christ and his early followers. “Christian” also distinguishes this part of the Bible from the pre-Christian Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures.
