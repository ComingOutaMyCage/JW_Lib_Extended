Justin Martyr




(c. 100–c. 165 C.E.) A Greek philosopher and theologian who wrote in defense of Christianity. He was born in Flavia Neapolis (now Nablus). Justin converted to Christianity in about 132 C.E., possibly at Ephesus, and was beheaded in Rome as a martyr.
The only surviving works by Justin are Apologies and Dialogue With Trypho, a Jew. In his Apologies, Justin tried to defend Christians against charges of hostility to the Roman State and the accusation that they were atheists. He also articulated his beliefs, which combined Scripture with Greek philosophy. His beliefs included the idea that God has no proper name. In his Dialogue, he argued that Jesus was the Messiah and that Judaism was obsolete.
By combining Christianity with philosophy, Justin disregarded the inspired command to adhere to what is written. (1Co 4:6) Other so-called Church Fathers followed his example, accelerating the foretold apostasy. (Mt 13:38, 39; 2Pe 2:1) That said, because Justin lived soon after the death of the apostles, his writings have historical value. For example, they show that he accepted the established Jewish canon and rejected the apocryphal books.
