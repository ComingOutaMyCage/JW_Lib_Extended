Sacred pole




The Hebrew word (ʼashe·rahʹ) refers to (1) a sacred pole representing Asherah, a Canaanite goddess of fertility, or (2) an image of the goddess Asherah herself. The poles apparently stood upright and were made, at least in part, of wood. They may have been uncarved poles, or even trees.​—De 16:21; Jg 6:26; 1Ki 15:13.
