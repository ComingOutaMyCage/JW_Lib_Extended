The principal cornerstone was the foundation cornerstone; a particularly strong one was generally chosen for public buildings and city walls. The word is used in a figurative sense for the founding of the earth, and Jesus is spoken of as “the foundation cornerstone” of the Christian congregation, which is likened to a spiritual house.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph 2:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:6-18:38:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Job 38:6</a>.</p>
