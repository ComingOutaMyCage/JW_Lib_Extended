<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The cover of the ark of the covenant, before which the high priest spattered the blood of sin offerings on Atonement Day. The Hebrew term comes from a root verb meaning “to cover over (sin)” or perhaps “to wipe away (sin).” It was made of solid gold, with two cherubs, one mounted at each end. It is sometimes referred to simply as “the cover.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:17-2:25:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 25:17-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:11-13:28:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1Ch 28:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:5-58:9:5" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Heb 9:5</a>)​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1001070225/">App. B5</a>.</p>
