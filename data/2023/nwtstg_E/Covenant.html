<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A formal agreement, or contract, between God and humans or between two human parties to do or refrain from doing something. Sometimes only one party was responsible to carry out the terms (a unilateral covenant, which was essentially a promise). At other times both parties had terms to carry out (a bilateral covenant). Besides covenants made by God with humans, the Bible mentions covenants between men, tribes, nations, or groups of people. Among the covenants that have had a far-reaching effect are those that God made with Abraham, David, the nation of Israel (Law covenant), and the Israel of God (new covenant).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:11-1:9:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 9:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:18-1:15:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 15:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:27-1:21:27" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 21:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:7-2:24:7" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Ex 24:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:7-14:21:7" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 2Ch 21:7</a>.</p>
