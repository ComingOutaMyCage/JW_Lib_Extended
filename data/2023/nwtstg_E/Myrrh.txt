Myrrh




An aromatic gum resin obtained from a variety of thorny shrubs or small trees of the genus Commiphora. Myrrh was one of the ingredients of the holy anointing oil. It was used to scent such things as garments or beds, and it was added to oil for massages and body lotions. Myrrh was also used to prepare bodies for burial.​—Ex 30:23; Pr 7:17; Joh 19:39.
