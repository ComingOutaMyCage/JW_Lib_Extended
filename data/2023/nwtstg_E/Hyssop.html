<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A plant with fine branches and leaves, used for sprinkling blood or water in cleansing ceremonies. It was possibly marjoram (<em>Origanum maru; Origanum syriacum</em>). As used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:29-43:19:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 19:29</a>, it may have been marjoram attached to a branch or durra, a variety of common sorghum (<em>Sorghum vulgare</em>), since this plant could have provided a stalk long enough to carry the sponge of sour wine to Jesus’ mouth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:22-2:12:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 12:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:7-19:51:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ps 51:7</a>.</p>
