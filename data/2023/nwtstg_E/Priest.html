<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man who officially represented God to the people he served, instructing them about God and his laws. Priests also represented the people before God, offering sacrifices as well as interceding and pleading for the people. Before the Mosaic Law was instituted, the family head served as priest for his family. Under the Mosaic Law, the male members of the family of Aaron of the tribe of Levi made up the priesthood. The rest of the male Levites were their assistants. At the inauguration of the new covenant, spiritual Israel became a nation of priests, with Jesus Christ as High Priest.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:41-2:28:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 28:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:10-66:5:10" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Re 5:10</a>.</p>
