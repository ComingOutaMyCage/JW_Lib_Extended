<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A symbolic place that “burns with fire and sulfur,” also described as “the second death.” Unrepentant sinners, the Devil, and even death and the Grave (or, Hades) are thrown into it. The inclusion of a spirit creature and also of death and Hades, all of which cannot be affected by fire, indicates that this lake is a symbol, not of everlasting torment, but of everlasting destruction.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:20-66:19:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Re 19:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:14-66:20:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 20:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:8-66:21:8" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 21:8</a>.</p>
