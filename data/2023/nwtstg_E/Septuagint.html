<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The earliest translations of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek, produced for the benefit of Greek-speaking Jews. Translation was begun in Egypt in the third century B.C.E. and was completed in the following century.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">According to tradition, about 70 Jewish scholars embarked on the project—thus the designation <em>Septuagint</em> from the Latin <em>Septuaginta,</em> meaning “70.” The translation is commonly referred to as <em>LXX,</em> the Roman numerals for 70. Early manuscripts of the <em>Septuagint</em> use either Greek characters or the four Hebrew letters that make up the Tetragrammaton (<em>YHWH</em> in English) to render God’s name. After the translation of the Hebrew canon was completed, apocryphal writings were added to the <em>Septuagint.</em> However, there is no evidence that Christian Bible writers acknowledged the apocryphal writings by quoting from them, though they often quoted from canonical books in the <em>Septuagint.</em> Furthermore, some first-century Christians had a miraculous gift, enabling them to discern which Bible books were inspired.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:4-46:12:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Co 12:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:10-46:12:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Today, the <em>Septuagint</em> is an important tool for studying and understanding the text of the Hebrew Scriptures, and it sheds light on the meaning of certain obscure Hebrew and Aramaic terms.</p>
