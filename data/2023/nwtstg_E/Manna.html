It miraculously appeared on the ground under a layer of dew every morning except on the Sabbath. When the Israelites first saw it, they said, “What is it?” or, in Hebrew, <em>“man huʼ?”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:13-2:16:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 16:13-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:35-2:16:35" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 35</a>) In other contexts, it is referred to as “the grain of heaven” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:24-19:78:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 78:24</a>), “bread from heaven” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:40-19:105:40" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 105:40</a>), and “the bread of mighty ones” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:25-19:78:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 78:25</a>). Jesus also referred to manna in a figurative sense.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:49-43:6:50" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joh 6:49, 50</a>.</p>
