<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Greek term has a twofold meaning. It refers to that which is <em>anti,</em> or <em>opposed to,</em> Christ. It may also refer to a false Christ, one <em>in the place of</em> Christ. All people, organizations, or groups that falsely claim to represent Christ or claim to be the Messiah or that oppose Christ and his disciples can properly be called antichrists.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:22-62:2:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Jo 2:22</a>.</p>
