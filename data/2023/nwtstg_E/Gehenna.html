<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Greek name for the Valley of Hinnom, south and southwest of ancient Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:31-24:7:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 7:31</a>) It was prophetically spoken of as a place where dead bodies would be strewn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:32-24:7:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer 7:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:19:6-24:19:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19:6</a>) There is no evidence that animals or humans were thrown into Gehenna to be burned alive or tormented. So the place could not symbolize an invisible region where human souls are tormented eternally in literal fire. Rather, Gehenna was used by Jesus and his disciples to symbolize the eternal punishment of “second death,” that is, everlasting destruction, annihilation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:14-66:20:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Re 20:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:22-40:5:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mt 5:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:28-40:10:28" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 10:28</a>.</p>
