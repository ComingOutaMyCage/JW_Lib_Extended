<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> We need to ask for help if we are to understand Bible prophecy. Consider this illustration. Imagine that you are visiting an unfamiliar place but a friend who is traveling with you is well-acquainted with the area. He knows exactly where you are and where each road leads. No doubt you would be glad that your friend agreed to come with you! In a similar way, Jehovah knows where we are in the stream of time and what is on the road ahead of us. So to understand Bible prophecy, we must humbly ask for Jehovah’s help.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:28-27:2:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 2:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:19-61:1:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 1:19, 20</a>.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> Why did Jehovah have prophecies recorded in his Word? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:11</a>) (See also picture.)</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Like any good parent, Jehovah wants his children to have a happy future. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Jeremiah 29:11</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> But unlike <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>any human parent, Jehovah can foretell the future with complete accuracy. He had prophecies recorded in his Word so that we can know about important events before they happen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 46:10</a>) Bible prophecies are loving gifts from our heavenly Father. But how can you be certain that what the Bible foretells really will come true?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What can a young person learn from Max’s experience?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> At school, our young ones are often surrounded by those who have little or no respect for the Bible. Their comments and conduct can raise doubts in the mind of a young Witness. Note the experience of a brother named Max. He says, “When I was in my teens, I started to doubt that my parents were teaching me the true religion and that the Bible was inspired by God.” What did his parents do? He says, “They reacted calmly, even though I know they were worried.” Max’s parents answered his questions from the Bible. Max did something too. “I studied Bible prophecy for myself,” he says, “and I discussed what I learned with other young ones.” With what result? Max says, “After that, I was convinced that the Bible is inspired by God!”</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What do you need to do if you have doubts, and why?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> If, like Max, you begin to doubt that the Bible contains the truth, you do not need to feel guilty. But you do need to do something about it. Doubt is like rust. If ignored, it can slowly destroy something valuable. To begin removing any “rust” from your faith, you need to ask yourself, ‘Do I believe what the Bible says about the future?’ If you are not sure, then you need to study Bible prophecies that have already come true. How can you go about doing that?</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What example did Daniel set with regard to how to study prophecy? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:10-27:12:10" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Daniel 12:10</a>) (See also picture.)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Daniel set a good example with regard to how to study prophecy. He approached prophecy with the <strong><em>right motive,</em></strong> to know the truth. Daniel was also <strong><em>humble,</em></strong> recognizing that Jehovah will give understanding to those who know him and who live by his clean standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:27-27:2:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Dan. 2:27, 28</a>; <strong>read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:10-27:12:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 12:10</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Daniel proved that he was humble by relying on Jehovah for help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:18-27:2:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Dan. 2:18</a>) Daniel was also <strong><em>thorough.</em></strong> He researched the inspired Scriptures that were available to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:11-24:25:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 25:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:2-27:9:2" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Dan. 9:2</a>) How can you imitate Daniel?</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> Why do some refuse to believe that Bible prophecies come true, but what should we do?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Examine your motives.</em></strong> Is your study of Bible prophecy motivated by a strong desire to know the truth? If it is, Jehovah will help you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 4:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:16-43:14:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 14:16, <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>17</a>) Why else might someone study prophecy? Some may do so in hopes of finding evidence that the Bible is not inspired by God. In that way, they feel that they can justify setting their own standards of right and wrong and living by those standards. However, we need to have the proper motivation. In addition, an important quality is needed to understand Bible prophecy.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What quality is needed to understand Bible prophecy? Explain.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Be humble.</em></strong> Jehovah promises to help the humble. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:6-59:4:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jas. 4:6</a>) So we need to pray for His help to understand Bible prophecy. We must also acknowledge that we need the help of the channel he is using to give us our spiritual food at the proper time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:42-42:12:42" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 12:42</a>) Jehovah is a God of order, so it makes sense that he would use just one channel to help us understand the truths contained in his Word.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:33-46:14:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:4-49:4:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:4-6</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Be thorough.</em></strong> Pick a prophecy that interests you and research that one first. That is what a sister named Esther did. She was interested in prophecies that foretold the coming of the Messiah. “When I was 15,” she says, “I began digging for proof that these prophecies were actually written before Jesus’ time.” What she learned from reading about the Dead Sea Scrolls convinced her. “Some of them were written before the time of Christ,” she notes, “so the prophecies they contained had to be from God.” Esther admits, “I had to read things several times to understand them.” But she is happy she made the effort. After thoroughly studying a number of Bible prophecies, she says, “I could clearly see for myself that the Bible is true!”</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> How do we benefit from proving to ourselves that the Bible is true?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> When we see how some prophecies in God’s Word have already been fulfilled, we develop an unbreakable trust in Jehovah and in the way that he is guiding us.

Let us briefly consider two prophecies recorded by Daniel that are now being fulfilled. Understanding them can help us to make wise decisions.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> From Daniel’s description of the dream image and particularly its feet, we learn several important truths. First, the Anglo-American World Power has shown its strength in some ways. For example, it played a key role in winning World War I and World War II. However, this world power has been weakened and will continue to be weakened by internal conflicts among its own citizens. Second, this alliance will be the last world power to rule before God’s Kingdom puts an end to all human kingdoms. Even though other nations may at times challenge the Anglo-American World Power, they will not replace it. We know that because “the stone” representing God’s Kingdom will crush the feet, the part of the image that depicts the Anglo-American alliance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:34-27:2:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 2:34, 35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:45" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 44, 45</a>.</p>

During the first half of the 20th century, for example, many brothers were imprisoned because of their Christian neutrality and some Witness children were expelled from school for the same reason. In recent decades, though, Jehovah’s servants living in the realm of that king have faced more subtle tests of their loyalty to God’s Kingdom. For instance, during election campaigns, a Christian might feel tempted to support one political party or candidate over another. He may not go so far as to vote; but in his mind and heart, he takes sides. How important it is that <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>we remain politically neutral not only in our actions but also in our thoughts and feelings!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:18-43:15:19" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 15:18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 18:36</a>.</p>
