<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE Bible compares our life as Christians to a race. The runners who successfully cross the finish line are rewarded with everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:7-55:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:7, 8</a>) We need to make every effort to keep on running, especially because the finish line is closer than ever. The apostle Paul, who successfully finished his race for life, identified what will help us to win the race. He directed us to “throw off every weight and . . . run with endurance the race that is set before us.”​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:1-58:12:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 12:1</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> When Paul wrote that we must “throw off <strong><em>every</em></strong> weight,” did he mean that there was no load a Christian should carry? No, that was not his point. Rather, he meant that we need to get rid of every <strong><em>unnecessary</em></strong> weight. This type of weight could hinder us and cause us to tire out. To endure, we must quickly identify and discard any unnecessary weight that could slow us down. At the same time, however, we do not want to cast aside loads that we should carry. Otherwise, we could disqualify ourselves from the race. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:5-55:2:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:5</a>) What loads must we carry?</p>

He wrote that “each one will carry his own load.” Paul here referred to our personal load of responsibility before God, something we must carry on our own. In this article, we will consider what is included in our “own load” and how we can carry it. Also, we will identify unnecessary weights that we might be carrying and learn how we can throw them off. Carrying our own load and throwing off unnecessary weight will help us to run our race for life successfully.</p>
