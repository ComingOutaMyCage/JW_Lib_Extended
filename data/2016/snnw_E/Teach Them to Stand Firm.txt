Teach Them to Stand Firm

(Matthew 28:19, 20)



             What a joy to teach Jehovah’s sheep
And to see how they have grown.
We have seen how he has guided them
As they’ve made the truth their own.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah, may you hear our prayer
And keep them in your watchful care.
In Jesus’ name, for them we plead: May they succeed;
May ev’ry one of them stand firm.


             Ev’ry day we said a prayer for them,
As their faith was under test.
We made time to teach and care for them;
They’ve grown strong, and they’ve been blessed.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah, may you hear our prayer
And keep them in your watchful care.
In Jesus’ name, for them we plead: May they succeed;
May ev’ry one of them stand firm.


             May they all maintain their confidence,
Trust in God and in his Son.
Through endurance and obedience,
May their race for life be won.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah, may you hear our prayer
And keep them in your watchful care.
In Jesus’ name, for them we plead: May they succeed;
May ev’ry one of them stand firm.
