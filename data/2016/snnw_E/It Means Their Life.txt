It Means Their Life

(Ezekiel 3:17-19)



             In this year of goodwill
by our God, all need to hear
That the day of his anger
will come, and it is near.
(CHORUS)
It means their life, but not just theirs;
It means our own life as well.
It means their life if they obey,
So all the nations we must tell;
We must tell.


             There’s a message to preach,
so we spread it all abroad.
We invite all to come and
be reconciled to God.
(CHORUS)
It means their life, but not just theirs;
It means our own life as well.
It means their life if they obey,
So all the nations we must tell;
We must tell.

(BRIDGE)
It’s urgent, it’s important,
That people listen, learn, and live.
We tell them, and we teach them;
Life-giving truth we freely give.
(CHORUS)
It means their life, but not just theirs;
It means our own life as well.
It means their life if they obey,
So all the nations we must tell;
We must tell.
