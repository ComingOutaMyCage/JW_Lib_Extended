We Must Have Faith

(Hebrews 10:38, 39)



1. On many occasions God spoke to men
By means of his prophets of old.
Today he is saying, ‘Let all repent,’
By God’s own Son we are told.
(CHORUS)
Do we have strong faith? Is it real?
We must build such faith to survive.
Is our faith proved true by our works?
By means of faith, we’ll be preserved alive.


2. We gladly obey Christ Jesus’ command
To share Kingdom truth far and wide.
We boldly declare God’s message of hope;
His promise we’ll never hide.
(CHORUS)
Do we have strong faith? Is it real?
We must build such faith to survive.
Is our faith proved true by our works?
By means of faith, we’ll be preserved alive.


3. Our faith is an anchor firm and secure;
We never will shrink back in fear.
Our trust in Jehovah helps us endure;
We know salvation is near.
(CHORUS)
Do we have strong faith? Is it real?
We must build such faith to survive.
Is our faith proved true by our works?
By means of faith, we’ll be preserved alive.
