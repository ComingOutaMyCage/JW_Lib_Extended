The Scriptures​—Inspired of God

(2 Timothy 3:16, 17)



1. God’s Word shines like a brilliant light,
Guides our feet through earth’s dark night.
If we follow it faithfully,
Surely its truth will set us free.

2. He provides us with words inspired,
Helps us learn what is required.
Holy writings can motivate,
Show how to teach and set things straight.

3. By these words from our God above,
We have come to know his love.
As we read in it ev’ry day,
God’s Word will keep us on the way.





(See also Ps. 119:105; Prov. 4:13.)
