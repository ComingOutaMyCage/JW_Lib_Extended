Grateful for God’s Word

(Philippians 2:16)



1. Jehovah, our Father, we want to express
How grateful we are that your Word we possess!
All Scripture is inspired;
its truth has set us free.
Its light gives us knowledge; the truth we can see.

2. Your Word has the power to reach deep inside.
Our thoughts and intentions, it helps to divide.
Your laws are clear and perfect,
your judgments ever true.
Your principles guide us in all that we do.

3. Your Word, O Jehovah, has human appeal.
Your prophets were like us; they felt what we feel.
Please help us build a strong faith
that follows what is heard.
We thank you, Jehovah, for your precious Word!
