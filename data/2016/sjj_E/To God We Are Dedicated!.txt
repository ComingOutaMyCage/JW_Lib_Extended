To God We Are Dedicated!

(Matthew 16:24)



1. To Christ, by our God, Jehovah, we have been drawn
To be his disciples from now on.
From Jehovah’s lofty throne,
How the light of truth has shone.
In our hearts, our faith has grown;
Our lives we vow to disown.
(CHORUS)
To God we are dedicated; This is our choice.
In him and in Jesus we now rejoice.


2. In prayer we have come before Jehovah to say
We’ll serve him forever and obey.
It’s a joy beyond compare,
One that we are glad to share,
As Jehovah’s name we bear,
And Kingdom truth we declare.
(CHORUS)
To God we are dedicated; This is our choice.
In him and in Jesus we now rejoice.
