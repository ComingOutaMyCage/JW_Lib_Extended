Sharing Joyfully in the Harvest

(Matthew 13:1-23)



1. We live in the time of the harvest,
A priv’lege beyond all compare.
The wheat fields stand ready before us,
And eagerly we have a share.
With Jesus, our finest example,
Directing our work in the field,
How happy and honored we feel each day.
We joyfully share in the yield.

2. True love for our God and our neighbor
Now moves us to speed up our pace.
Both preaching and teaching are urgent,
For shortly the end we will face.
The joy we receive is a blessing,
A gift that Jehovah provides.
By faith we endure till this work is done
And joyfully share at his side.





(See also Matt. 24:13; 1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Tim. 4:2.)
