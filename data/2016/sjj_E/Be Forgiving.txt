SONG 130
Be Forgiving

(Psalm 86:5)



1. Lovingly Jehovah
Made provision through his Son
For our sins to be forgiven
And for death to be undone.
If we truly are repentant,
His forgiveness we can claim
On the basis of Christ’s ransom,
Asking pardon in his name.

2. We receive such mercy
When we act like God above
And forgive each other freely,
Showing empathy and love.
Putting up with one another,
Putting hurtfulness away;
Showing honor to our brother,
Showing love’s surpassing way.

3. Mercy is a virtue
That we all should cultivate.
It will keep us from resentment,
From the bitterness of hate.
When we imitate Jehovah,
Who is unsurpassed in love,
We will truly be forgiving;
We will be like God above.





(See also Matt. 6:12; Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13.)
