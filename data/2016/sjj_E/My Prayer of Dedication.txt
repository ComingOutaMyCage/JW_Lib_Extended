My Prayer of Dedication

(Matthew 22:37)



1. Take my heart and may it love
Truth and wisdom from above.
Take my voice and let it sing
Praises always to my King.

2. Take my feet and take my hands;
Let them serve your wise commands.
Take my silver and my gold.
Nothing, Lord, would I withhold.

3. Take my life and bring it, Lord,
With your will, in full accord.
Take myself, may all I do
Be well-pleasing, Jah, to you.





(See also Ps. 40:8; John 8:29; 2 Cor. 10:5.)
