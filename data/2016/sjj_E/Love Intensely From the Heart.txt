Love Intensely From the Heart

(1 Peter 1:22)



1. When our love is pure and intense,
We make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
Love is his greatest quality,
Something that we hold dear.
Warm affection glows in our hearts,
Making a loyal friendship grow.
Love always acts unselfishly,
Proving our love sincere.
When we see a friend in need,
We’ll be there to lend a helping hand.
Truly we can be a friend,
Someone who can understand.
Jesus showed what love really means,
Helping us see Jehovah’s love,
Touching our hearts and moving us.
Tender feelings are a start.
Love intensely from the heart.
