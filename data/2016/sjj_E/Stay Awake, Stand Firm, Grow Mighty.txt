SONG 126
Stay Awake, Stand Firm, Grow Mighty

(1 Corinthians 16:13)



1. Stay awake, stand firm, grow mighty,
Be determined to endure.
Carry on with manly courage,
For the victory is sure.
We obey Christ Jesus’ clear command;
Under him we firmly take our stand.
(CHORUS)
Stay awake, stand firm, and grow mighty!
Carry on right to the end!


2. Stay awake, and keep your senses,
Always ready to obey.
Stay alert to Christ’s direction
Through his faithful slave today.
Heed the counsel of the older men,
Who protect his sheep and truth defend.
(CHORUS)
Stay awake, stand firm, and grow mighty!
Carry on right to the end!


3. Stay awake, remain united
As the good news we defend.
Though our enemies will fight it,
We will preach until the end.
Join the shout of praise throughout the land.
Look! Jehovah’s day is soon at hand!
(CHORUS)
Stay awake, stand firm, and grow mighty!
Carry on right to the end!
