Listen, Obey, and Be Blessed

(Luke 11:28)



1. If we have listened to Christ, will we show it?
His teaching shines as it shows us the way.
It makes us happy to hear and to know it,
But we’ll be blessed if we know and obey.
(CHORUS)
Listen, obey, and be blessed
When you hear God’s will expressed.
If you’d be happy and enter his rest,
Listen, obey, and be blessed.


2. Our way of life, like a house, gives protection
When it is built on the rock, not on sand.
If we apply Jesus’ loving direction,
We’ll build a life which on bedrock will stand.
(CHORUS)
Listen, obey, and be blessed
When you hear God’s will expressed.
If you’d be happy and enter his rest,
Listen, obey, and be blessed.


3. Just as a tree rooted deep by the waters
Gives of its fruit when each season arrives,
If we obey as God’s own sons and daughters,
We’ll all be blessed and enjoy endless lives.
(CHORUS)
Listen, obey, and be blessed
When you hear God’s will expressed.
If you’d be happy and enter his rest,
Listen, obey, and be blessed.
