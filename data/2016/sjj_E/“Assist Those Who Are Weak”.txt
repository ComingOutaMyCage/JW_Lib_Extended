“Assist Those Who Are Weak”

(Acts 20:35)



1. Many are the weaknesses
That we all possess.
Still Jehovah cares for us,
Loves us nonetheless.
He is so merciful;
His love, so powerful.
May we show this kind of love,
Help those in distress.

2. Some at times are weak in faith,
Strong though they appear.
By our reassuring words,
We can calm their fears.
Weak ones to God belong;
His spirit makes them strong.
May we feel their pain and cares,
Help them dry their tears.

3. Rather than condemn the weak,
We should bear in mind
How much we can strengthen them
By our being kind.
May we be diligent,
Give them encouragement.
As we lend our kind support,
Comfort they will find.
