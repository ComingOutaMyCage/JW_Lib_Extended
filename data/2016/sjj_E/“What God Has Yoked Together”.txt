“What God Has Yoked Together”

(Matthew 19:5, 6)



1. With dignity and joy,
A threefold cord is bound.
With God and men to witness,
These sacred vows resound.
(CHORUS 1)
He vowed before Jehovah
To love her from the heart.
“What God has yoked together,
Let no man put apart.”


2. They both have searched God’s Word
To learn to do his will,
And now they seek his blessing,
Their promise to fulfill.
(CHORUS 2)
She vowed before Jehovah
To love him from the heart.
“What God has yoked together,
Let no man put apart.”
