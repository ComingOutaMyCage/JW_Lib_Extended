SONG 30
My Father, My God and Friend

(Hebrews 6:10)



1. Life in this world can be hard.
Life in this world can bring tears and pain.
Still ev’ry day I will say,
“My life is not in vain.”
(CHORUS)
For God is not unrighteous,
And he remembers the love I’ve shown.
So he is ever near me;
With Jehovah, I’m not alone.
Yes, God is my provider
and my protector down to the end.
Yes, Jehovah is my Father,
My God and Friend.


2. Gone are the days of my youth;
Days of calamity now are here.
Still through the eyes of my faith,
My hope is bright and clear.
(CHORUS)
For God is not unrighteous,
And he remembers the love I’ve shown.
So he is ever near me;
With Jehovah, I’m not alone.
Yes, God is my provider
and my protector down to the end.
Yes, Jehovah is my Father,
My God and Friend.






(See also Ps. 71:17, 18.)
