SONG 138
Beauty in Gray-Headedness

(Proverbs 16:31)



1. Here with us are aged ones,
Those whose youth has passed.
Here among us they endure;
Still they’re holding fast.
Loss of strength besets them all;
Loss of mates for some.
Father, please confirm their faith
In the life to come.
(CHORUS)
Father, you remember
How in faith they’ve run.
Give them your assurance;
May they hear, “Well done!”


2. Splendid is gray-headedness
Found in ways of right.
Beautiful are faithful ones
In Jehovah’s sight.
May we always recognize
They were once young too.
Loyally they gave their best
When their strength was new.
(CHORUS)
Father, you remember
How in faith they’ve run.
Give them your assurance;
May they hear, “Well done!”
