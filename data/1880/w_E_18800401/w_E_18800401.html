<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Melchisedec Priesthood.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">DIALOGUE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. We have not had our usual talks of late, Brother A., and I called for one this evening.  Suppose we drop our study of Revelation, tonight, and consider the Melchisedec Priesthood.  I have a new idea concerning Melchisedec, viz.: that he was really Christ Jesus in another manifestation; the same person who was afterward born in Bethlehem. What do you think of it?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. It may be a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thought to you, Brother B., but it certainly is an old one to most of the deep thinkers of the church; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they have usually thought of the question, but usually, also, have concluded that it is a mere random thought, suggested by the statement that he was &quot;without beginning of days, nor end of years,&quot; but upon close examination of the subject it has been dropped.  This, however, is not an argument against your view, which you supposed new.  If you have any good reasons, let me have them, and let us reason together, and let the new idea stand or fall accordingly.  It is a thing we should always remember, however, that all new things are not, because new, true.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. I may have been hasty in deciding on this subject.  The text you refer to has been the one on which I built most--&quot;Without beginning of days, nor end of years.&quot; How would you understand this text unless by supposing that it refers to God, who is &quot;from everlasting to everlasting&quot;?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. Well, to take your view of it would make Melchisedec the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Father,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not our Lord Jesus, who is called the &quot;first-begotten,&quot; &quot;only-begotten,&quot; &quot;the Son,&quot; &quot;the beginning of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">creation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God.&quot;  We believe that Jesus had an existence before He came into the world, that it was in glory, and that He left the glory which He had with the Father </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;before the world was.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We believe the word to teach that since &quot;His obedience unto death, even the death of the cross,&quot; &quot;God (the Father) hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name above every name,&quot; etc.; that now all power in heaven and earth is given unto Him.&quot;  We believe that &quot;of His kingdom there is no end,&quot; and that &quot;His throne is forever and ever.&quot; But we cannot suppose that He never had a beginning, since it is positively stated that He was &quot;the beginning of the creation.&quot;  This, of course, involves the idea that the Heavenly Father and Son are no more one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">person</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than an earthly father and son could be one in person. There is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one-ness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> however, a unity, existing between them, the one-ness of will, aim, &amp;c., as it was written of Jesus, &quot;Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God.&quot;  We remember further that Jesus prayed for us, His church, that we might have the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same kind of unity;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not unity of person, but unity of purpose, aim, and interest.  He prays &quot;That they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> may be ONE, even as Thou, Father, and I are one.&quot;  This shows us clearly the kind of one-ness existing between our Father and our Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If, then, the text, &quot;without beginning of days, nor end of years,&quot; as applied to Melchisedec, means that he never had a beginning nor end of life, it would prove not that he was Jesus, but Jehovah.  We think, however, that this is not its meaning, but--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. Let me first explain my process of reasoning on the matter, that you may more fully answer. Paul says that Jesus was made a priest after the order of Melchisedec. Now, I reason that if of that order, He must have been the head or founder of it; that therefore Melchisedec was Christ.  If Melchisedec was only a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if he were not Christ, would it not imply that Jesus must be lower than him, and consequently not in as high honor as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Melchisedec, who was the head of the order?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. I do not think your reasoning sound.  You seem to forget that men are sometimes used as types of Christ, and that the type is always inferior to the antitype.  For instance: Adam was a type, as the head of the human family; David was the first king who ever &quot;sat on the throne of the Lord;&quot; Moses was a figure of Him that was to come, as it is written: &quot;A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like unto me.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If Christ is a prophet like unto or after the order of Moses, does it prove that Moses was not a man-- that Moses must have been Christ? If David (the name means the anointed --the Christ) was a type of Christ, and called &quot;the Lord's anointed,&quot; does it prove that he was not a man?  If Adam was the head of the race was he really not a man; was he Christ in some previous manifestation?  By no means.  Adam, David, Moses, Aaron, as well as Solomon, Isaac, Jacob, Melchisedec, &amp;c., were but figures of the true </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Head, King,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Prophet, Priest,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and Melchisedec, as a type, showed how the kingly and priestly offices (separate under the law) would both unite in Him, so that He would be a &quot;Priest upon His throne.&quot;  All the types are natural, representing things higher. First, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> head, king, prophet and priest: afterward, the spiritual.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R195 : page 1::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. This, I admit, seems to overturn my new ideas, but let me know how Melchisedec was without father or mother?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. It would scarcely be necessary to remind you that Christ was not without a Father.  Call to mind His words--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Father</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> forgive them;&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Father,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> glorify Thou me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.&quot;  It could not then refer to Christ in His pre-existent state, nor, can it apply to Him as &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ Jesus,&quot; for Jesus was &quot;born of a woman.&quot;  Wakefield's new version renders this (`Heb. 7:3`) &quot;Of whose father, mother, pedigree, birth, and death, we have no account.&quot;  There was a strict record kept of parentage, birth, death, &amp;c., of every Levite, so that any one claiming to be a priest or Levite could prove it by the records.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Diaglott, renders this text, &quot;without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life, but having been made like to the Son of God, remains a priest perpetually.&quot;  Some take the view (as does Wakefield, quoted above) that this text only means that no account was kept of his birth, death, &amp;c.  While we may feel sure that he had a father and mother and a beginning of days, we are not sure that he died.  `Verse 8` seems to imply that he, like Enoch and Elijah, did not die--&quot;Here, indeed, men (the Levitical Priesthood) receive tithes, who die; but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">there,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one (Melchisedec received tithes), of whom it is affirmed that he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lives.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This is a positive statement that Melchisedec did not die.  We must suppose that he was translated.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. Would not the fact that he was called a priest, and that he did not die, give strength to my suggestion that he was Christ?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. No, the very reverse.  It is testified of Melchisedec that he did not die, &quot;that he lives,&quot; but it is testified of Christ that He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">did</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> die. This same Paul could say of Christ: &quot;Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man.&quot;  We conclude, then, that as Christ, on the spiritual plane of life, had a Father, and on the earthly plane a mother, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">did &quot;die</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for our sins,&quot; &quot;even the death of the cross,&quot; therefore He was not the same person as Melchisedec.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. Yes, now I see clearly that they are not the same, but can you show why the two priesthoods are given, and why they are contrasted?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. Jesus fills up so large a work, and so varied, that many types are required to illustrate His work. David illustrated His kingly power --putting down all enemies. Solomon represented His peaceful reign (the millennium), and His wisdom. &quot;In His day the righteous</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R195 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">shall flourish.&quot;  But these were only imperfect types.  Their kingdoms and lives had an end.  A type was needed which would show that His kingdom would have no end.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, the Aaronic Priesthood was a type of the Christian priesthood, during the time Christ and His body suffer and die, down until they shall appear in the glory of the kingdom.  Here the Aaronic type ceases, and where </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ceases the Melchisedec type begins.  The Melchisedec type shows no death, no sacrifice, only the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reigning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">blessing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --king and priest.  How beautifully </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> illustrates what </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we must</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shortly be.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  With Jesus our head, we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soon</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;kings and priests</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto God, and reign on the earth.&quot;  One of the most notable events of that reign will be the blessing of the natural descendants of Abraham, as shown in the type (`Gen. 14:18-20`): &quot;And Melchisedek, king of Salem (type of Christ--head and body) ...blessed Abraham.&quot;  Then &quot;the elder (natural Israel) shall serve the younger&quot; (spiritual Israel), and pay them tribute and homage, as Abraham paid tribute and homage to Melchisedec.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;If He were on earth He could not be a priest,&quot; says Paul.  I am not trying to prove to you that Jesus' claims as a priest are based upon titles of the law.  No, we claim that He came of Judah, the kingly tribe.  As a priest, He did not attempt to usurp your office.  No, He was offered on the great altar--the earth itself, and when He went in with the real blood of sin-offering, He did not attempt to go into the holy places made with hands, but into the real ones, of which yours is only a type or shadow.  Soon the sacrifice will all be over.  He has left a measure of suffering and death to be filled up by us, His body. Soon all will be over, and we &quot;shall appear with Him&quot; to &quot;bless the people&quot; (as you do in symbol), but it will be with kingly power united to our priestly office.  And then, too, when complete, our priesthood shall continue forever.  See, God gave you a type of this higher priesthood in Melchisedec, &quot;King of Peace&quot; and &quot;Priest of God,&quot; of whom it is testified </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;he lives.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  So when our priesthood reaches the plane typified by Melchisedec, we will never die, but abide a &quot;Royal Priesthood&quot; forever.  How indispensable are both of these types, the Aaronic, showing how we must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Him, and the Melchisedec, how we shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">live with Him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and be glorified together; &quot;no cross, no crown.&quot;</font><br />
<br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">DEATH SWALLOWED UP.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then shall be brought to pass the saying, which is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.&quot; `1 Cor. 15:54`. The apostle has just led us down the stream of time, to the resurrection of the church, when they who sleep in Jesus awake immortal, and the living members of His body are changed to His likeness, and together are caught up to meet the Lord in the air.  And here he quotes from `Isaiah 25:8`, saying, that then that prophecy will be fulfilled, not that it is fulfilled by the resurrection of the saints, but that it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;then&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> begins to be fulfilled.  The bruising of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">satan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (&quot;under your feet&quot;), `Rom. 16:20`, and the destroying of death, have both been deferred until the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body of Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the church) is complete.  With the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that company, &quot;the Royal Priesthood,&quot; is complete, and their work is before them.  That work includes the binding of Satan, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">destruction of death; i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the &quot;swallowing up of death in victory,&quot; and the restoration of mankind to harmony with God, and to that condition of life enjoyed before sin entered--a condition of at one-ment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This work of restoration apparently occupied all of the thousand years (`Rev. 20:4`), since it is called &quot;the times (years) of restitution.&quot; Just as death, like a huge monster, has devoured the human family gradually for six thousand years, so</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R87 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to be destroyed gradually (&quot;swallowed up&quot;) during the millennial reign, until, at its close, He shall have completely destroyed death, and him that has the power of death, that is, the devil.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That this is the apostle's thought may be seen by referring to the prophecy from which he quotes. After describing the coming time of trouble in grandly awful and symbolic language, and the exaltation of the kingdom when &quot;the Lord shall reign in Mount Zion,&quot; continues: &quot;And He will destroy in this mountain (kingdom) the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.  He will swallow up death in victory.&quot; Thus our work is seen to be two-fold --destroying and removing sin and its effects, and thus restoring to man happiness, purity, and all that was lost through sin.  But while </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">work</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> really comes in the next age, let us not forget that if we are in full sympathy with the object of &quot;our high calling,&quot; we will be interested in doing all in our power, in the present age, to counteract sin, and to restore mankind to harmony with our Father.  We are thus ambassadors for God, as though He did beseech them through us: We ask them in Christ's stead; be ye reconciled to God. `2 Cor. 5:20`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">====================</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R87 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">FROM AND TO THE WEDDING.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A brother requests our explanation of `Luke 12:36`, and `Matt. 25:10`, intimating the possibility of a mistranslation in one of them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have no fault to find with the translation nor do we know of any critic who materially alters either of these texts.  The Diaglott renders `Luke 12:36`.  &quot;Be you like men waiting for their Master when he will return from the nuptial feasts; that when he comes and knocks they may instantly open to him.&quot;  And `Matt. 25:10`, is rendered: &quot;And while they were going away to buy, the Bridegroom came and they who were prepared entered with him to the nuptual feasts.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The fact that one text speaks of going in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the marriage, and the other of a return from a marriage has troubled some and has given rise to the query: &quot;May not Luke refer to a company not the bride, but coming after?&quot;  We think not, for the reason that the context addresses them as &quot;Little flock&quot;--`vs. 32`.  The marriage (union) of Jesus and his church is so different in many respects from earthly marriages that it can be but imperfectly illustrated by them.  In the earthly, the Bridegroom comes to the Bride's home and there they are married; but not so the heavenly.  True the Bridegroom </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comes</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;The Lord himself shall descend,&quot; but the church also </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">goes</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- &quot;We shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air,&quot; &amp;c.  There is in fact no one scene which could fully picture the event, therefore several are used.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our Lord comes as &quot;a thief&quot; upon the world and takes away his Bride. It is not to be in the general form of a marriage, rather </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">an elopement.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He has communicated to the virgin (chaste) church his design and instructed that during all the night she &quot;sleep not as do others,&quot; (`2 Thes. 4`.) but be awake, robed, ready and eagerly watching the various signs promised.  The earthly marriage feast at the Bride's home lasted an indefinite time and when it was over Bridegroom and Bride went to his home where all things were in readiness and the servants on the alert, robed in their best livery were watching and waiting to receive their Master and Mistress; and woe to the servant found careless or napping on this important occasion.  Our Lord used this illustration to show the proper attitude of his church at his coming.  They are to be on the alert, watching, robed and waiting, having their &quot;loins girt about with truth,&quot; i.e., being nerved up, made strong by the truth and ready for any service.  Our Bridegroom does not come to us after the marriage, but when he comes we are to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as those servants were under</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">those circumstances.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Bride </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thus awake and expecting the Bridegroom hears his knock and opens to him.  The sleeping world and drowsy worldly church, neither hear the knock nor heed his (&quot;parousia&quot;) presence, but eat, drink, plant, build and marry as ever and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;know not&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">His presence.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This scripture has, we believe, been largely fulfilled.  The prophetic arguments have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rapped</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> loudly enough for some to hear who were awake and ready.  They declare to us plainly that--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Our Lord has come to take us home;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       O hail happy day!&quot; Yes we heard his knock and opened by faith and received him, and his words have been fulfilled--&quot;Blessed are those servants.&quot;  Yes truly blessed has been our experience since we recognized his presence and received him.  Verily he has girded himself (become our servant) and caused us to sit down to meat (heavenly food,) and we have feasted and are still feasting upon Jesus and His word. We thank him that ours has been a continuous growth in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus, whom to know is life everlasting. True, we have long known him in a measure and have known much of his plan, &amp;c., but our realization of his love and of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fullness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is in our &quot;Head&quot; and our experimental knowledge of &quot;the deep things of God&quot; have been greater than we could have supposed possible.  It has been &quot;a feast of fat things&quot; of &quot;wines (Joys) well refined.&quot;  But this knock has not been heard by all the servants at once.  It is an individual matter; each must hear for himself as Jesus further explains --`Rev. 3:20` &quot;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me.&quot;  The presence and knock began in the Fall of 1874.  It still continues and many have received him and are being feasted and prepared for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">elopement.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Soon from the field, mill and bed one shall be taken and another left--&quot;caught up to meet (unite with) the Lord in the air.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand the word to teach that those taken, although knowing neither the day nor hour of their taking will not be in darkness on the subject but will have discerned the Lord's presence, received him and been feasted before going to him. Have you heard his knock and opened to him?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us next examine the parable of `Matt. 25`.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THE TEN VIRGINS.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Unlike many of our Lord's parables this one is placed and fixed by the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;then.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Taken in connection with the `preceding chapter`, it is fixed as belonging to the last generation of the church living when the Lord comes.  The kingdom of heaven is a term applicable to the church, which, from its establishment at Pentecost has always been God's kingdom in which He is King and over which his will is law.  True, in the future it will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;set up&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and then it will be more generally recognized by mankind but even now we are really his kingdom; and when it has nearly finished its course in the world--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The name </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">virgin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> means chaste, pure; in the parable ten are made to represent a larger company of chaste ones in the church.  The conditions of this parable have been fulfilled by the church of our day.  At any other period as well as the last, the church might have been properly represented by virgins of any number, but of no other than the last could it be said: &quot;They took their lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom,&quot; because not until this nineteenth century has the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;lamp&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (&quot;Thy word is a lamp&quot;) been in the hands of the virgins--the church, to give them light on the subject of the Bridegroom's coming.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">During the three and a halftimes or 1260 years of Papal supremacy, ending A.D. 1798, these two witnesses (the old and new testaments) had been clothed in the sackcloth of a dead (latin) language, but since that time it has been taken up by bible and tract societies and scattered over the world by the million.  And it is since this book has been thus among the virgins that its teaching of the coming kingdom and coming Bridegroom has begun to contradict the assumptions of Papacy--that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was his kingdom and its Pope his vicegerent.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Just at a proper time then, as the word of God had begun to circulate freely, comes what is commonly known as the Miller movement.  It was a movement among christian people of all denominations, principally Methodists and Baptists, a general awakening, and included many of the best people in all of the churches.  Mr. Wm. Miller, a very Godly man, (a baptist) was the prime mover in this country, though simultaneously Wolf and others were calling attention to the same subject in Europe and Asia; the real movement, however, was in our own land.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the parable mentions a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">going</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to meet, &amp;c.  What does this signify?  This is another evidence of our stage of the church, for although</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the bible had always taught the &quot;second coming of Christ,&quot; yet it had been understood in so general a way that none were able to settle upon any definite time and say-- then he will come; consequently there could be no such </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">going forth to</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">meet him,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as is demanded by the parable.  Now the case is changed, Wm. Miller's attention is attracted to and riveted upon the prophecies. He reads: &quot;Unto 2300 days and the sanctuary shall be cleansed.&quot; He counts and finds that it would end in 1843 or 1844.  He supposes the earth to be the sanctuary and expects its cleansing to be by literal fire.  He, though a calm deliberate man, could not forbear to tell his fellows that so read the prophecies, and so he believed.  It spread rapidly, among old and young alike, and many virgins after examining with the lamp, were convinced that</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R88 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the word taught them to expect the coming of their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bridegroom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in 1844; and on the strength of this faith they went forth to meet him.  In going they walked by faith, not by sight, but they did what the virgins never had done before, because never before had the word, or lamp led them to thus definitely expect him.  (We believe him to have erred both in what the sanctuary is and what the fire is.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Five of the virgins were wise and five were foolish.  Of those who went forth, some were actuated by excitement, and carried along with the occasion, but others--the wise-- not only had the zeal of the moment, but it was backed by a deep, heartfelt desire and spiritual yearning for the Bridegroom's presence. &quot;While the Bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.&quot; Their expectations of the coming of the Bridegroom, and burning of the world, met with disappointment. He &quot;tarried,&quot; and they slept.  They dreamed all sorts of foolish things, and various times for His coming, as illustrated by the various fanciful and fanatical views held by them during many years succeeding.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At midnight, or during the night (the Greek word is not definite, like ours), there was a cry made: &quot;Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.&quot;  Who made the cry is a matter of no consequence. The cry was made before morning too; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the announcement and preaching that the Bridegroom was due to be here in 1874, was made, as is well known by many of our readers. (We understand that morning began to dawn in 1873, where the 6,000 years from Adam ended.)  It was made first among the Second Advent denomination.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The evidences from scripture that the 6,000 years would end and the morning dawn in 1873, and that, with the morning the Bridegroom was due, was preached upon by a brother of very marked ability as a prophetic student, who also published a series of articles on the subject in the leading paper of that denomination, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(&quot;The World's Crisis&quot;)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as well as afterward in a pamphlet, and finally as a monthly paper called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Midnight Cry.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The message attracted general attention from the people of that denomination, so that in a few issues its circulation ran up to 15,000, or more than all other papers devoted to the subject of the Second Advent together.  This, we believe, fulfilled this parable, not that Advent people alone are virgins, but they were the part of the company that were at that time looking for the Bridegroom, but asleep and unconscious as to the time of His coming.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.&quot;  Their lamps once pointed them to 1844, but He &quot;tarried.&quot;  A </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cry</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is now made that the tarrying time was thirty years (from '44 to '74), as paralleled by the thirty years of the Jewish age, from the birth of Jesus until He &quot;came,&quot; being thirty years of age. This cry proclaimed to the virgins that the &quot;2,300 days&quot; did end in 1844, but that the thing expected was wrong.  Instead of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;sanctuary</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> cleansing&quot; meaning the burning of the world, it is now seen that the sanctuary, or God's dwelling-place, is the church, and therefore it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that is to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cleansed.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It is to be cleansed by the separation of the wise and foolish virgins at the end of the tarrying time-- 1874--when the Bridegroom came. When the cry is heard, the virgins begin to awaken.  Some have of the oil (the spirit) in their vessels (themselves), as well as in their lamps (the word).  These are able to see.  To see what?  That the Bridegroom is coming merely? No, they all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knew that,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but it enables them to see </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his coming and to again go forth by faith as before.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lamp</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shed forth light on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at the first going forth, so it shed light again on the same subject --the time--and that time was 1874. And bear in mind that the cry is made before morning--in the night, and that it announces the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Bridegroom&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and further, if at all right--if it was the true cry, &quot;the Bridegroom came&quot; as it had announced.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All of this has been wonderfully fulfilled, it seems to us.  It was first seen that the night (6000 years) would end with 1873.  There the Millennial morn began to dawn. And the monthly, called the &quot;Midnight Cry&quot; ceased because the name was no longer applicable when the morning had begun to dawn. The editor of that magazine tersely remarked (p. 30), &quot;Will some one inform me how a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Midnight Cry&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> can be made in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">morning?&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The division between the wise and foolish virgins, the one part seeing the 1874 time as taught in God's sure word of prophecy, and the others interested at first, but unable upon examination of the word to see any light on the subject, is illustrated by the fact that the 15000 readers of the &quot;Midnight Cry&quot; dwindled down to about 2000.  The others went to the &quot;Eastern Question,&quot; &amp;c., to look for light, confessing that they no longer had light from the sure word of prophecy on the time of the Bridegroom's coming.  They took the paper, examined the arguments and apparently sought to get oil or light from the wise, but it must be an inward oil (the indwelling Spirit) that will reveal some of the deep things of God.  Of this Spirit the wise can have enough for themselves but never enough to spare.  Each virgin must buy for herself.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While the advent people have been used to a large degree as representatives in the movements of the parable, yet we do not think that it is confined to them, nor to people who were interested in the movements prior to the coming of our Bridegroom. (1874.)  The writer, among many others now interested, was sound asleep, in profound ignorance of the cry, etc., until 1876, when being awakened he trimmed his lamp (for it is still very early in the morning.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It showed him clearly that the Bridegroom had come and that he is living &quot;in the days of the Son of Man.&quot;  Yes the Bridegroom has come and is making up his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">jewels,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">early</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before the servants of the house or the outside world are awake the chaste virgin church will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">caught</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">away</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be united to her Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;They that were ready went in with him to the marriage.&quot;  Some time ago we supposed that this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">going</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> meant translation, but it now seems clear to us that it is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">going in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">condition</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> rather than a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">place;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that it implies a withdrawing from the world and a coming in to a condition of special preparation for the marriage. This too has been fulfilled to a great extent, and particularly of late.  The theme of most of our writers and public and private speakers has been Holiness--the &quot;Wedding Garment&quot; --for without </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">holiness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no man shall see the Lord.  And this preparation still continues.  Some are just awakening, and others are more nearly dressed in the spotless robes of Christ's righteousness.  It is a time of helping each other to put on the wedding dress.  (&quot;His Wife hath </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">made herself ready.&quot;)</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another parable (`Matt. 22:11`) shows a work which must take place </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">before the marriage,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> viz.: &quot;When the King came in to see the guests.&quot; This shows an inspection among those assembled, and one not having the wedding garment is cast out from the light of the position into which all had come; cast into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;outer darkness,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the darkness which covers the world on this subject; the darkness in which the foolish virgins were when their lamps would not burn.  These so cast out are not &quot;counted worthy to escape the things coming on the world, and consequently have part in the time of trouble, when there will be &quot;weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But when will our Lord be present as King?  We answer that the parallels of the Jewish and Gospel ages, so perfect throughout, indicate this point also.  It was just three and a half years after John had announced Jesus as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Bridegroom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Jno. 3:29`) to the typical house of Israel, that He came to them as their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;King.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Behold, thy King cometh unto thee&quot; was fulfilled the day Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the ass.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">parallel point</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the Gospel age shows Him to have been due here as King in the Spring of 1878, just three and a half years after He came as Bridegroom, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">some</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time this parable must be fulfilled, and the King inspect the company assembled for the marriage supper.  So at some time after 1878 we may look to see some (we wish there were none) cast out of the light into which all had come. As the light was on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the time of the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bridegroom's coming,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it would seem to teach that some would come to disbelieve the Bridegroom's presence. Why?  Because not clothed with the wedding garment.  Probably they will trust in, and &quot;go about to establish their own righteousness,&quot; which is as &quot;filthy rags,&quot; and endeavor to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">climb</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> up some other way,&quot; and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">win their way to eternal life.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">After inspection, we expect translation --to be &quot;changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye&quot;-- to be &quot;made like unto Christ's glorious body,&quot; and to be &quot;caught up to meet the Lord in the air.&quot;  This will be our marriage--being made like and united to Him.  But the supper is apparently delayed until the company of our loved brethren --those who go through the trouble, and &quot;wash their robes,&quot; etc.--shall have &quot;come up out of (after) the great tribulation,&quot; because, after the marriage of the Lamb, the message goes forth: &quot;Blessed are they that are called unto the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">marriage supper</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lamb.&quot; (`Rev. 19:9`). Among this great company, whom no man can number, will doubtless be many of the foolish virgins. They have lost the position and honors of the Bride, but evidently, ultimately get oil and may gain a place among &quot;the virgins, her companions that follow her.&quot; `Psa. 14:14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the Bridegroom says, in answer to their appeal, &quot;I recognize you not,&quot; we believe it has reference to His not recognizing any as part of His Bride when once that company is complete, or the door to that position closed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Have you heard the cry, the knock announcing our Bridegroom's presence?  Are you awake?  Are you seeing to it that you are clothed with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">righteousness of Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as with a garment.  See that, under His direction, you have it &quot;without spot or wrinkle or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">any such thing,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and help one another, &quot;and so much the more as you see the day approaching,&quot; remembering that it is written, &quot;The Lamb's wife hath </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">made herself ready.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Rev. 19:7`.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE TWO LIKENESSES.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;There are two likenesses spoken of in the bible--the likeness of men, and the likeness of God.  From several scriptures it is evident these cannot be the same, though they are sometimes confounded in the minds of the people.  David says: &quot;I shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">satisfied</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when I awake with thy likeness.&quot; `Psa. 17:15`.  As much as to say I am not satisfied now, because I am not in thy likeness.  We know the Psalmist had the form and likeness of man; hence man is not in the likeness of God.  If it be claimed that this was a prophecy of Christ, the conclusion can not be weakened, but rather strengthened, on account of positive statements. &quot;Who being in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form of God,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form of a servant,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and was made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">likeness of men.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Phil. 2:6,7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here we have a clear statement of the condescension of Christ; in leaving His own exalted condition--&quot;The glory He had with the Father before the world was&quot;--and coming down to the condition of man.  He had the nature and form of God, and took not the nature of Angels. `Heb. 2`; but the seed of Abraham, the nature and form of man.  But if man is in the nature and form of God then the condescension of Christ exists only in name.  &quot;Though He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rich,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> yet for your sakes He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">became</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">poor,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that ye, through His poverty, might be rich.&quot;  This passage gives us the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">object</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of His condescension, to enrich us.  But the value of this offering of Christ depends upon the depth of our poverty, or the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">contrast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> between what He was and what He became.  Or the difference between what we are and what we may become through Him.  He came down to our level that we might go up to His level.  He took our nature and form, that we might become partakers of the Divine Nature, and in due time be made like Him when we shall see Him as He is.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Wondrous love and abasement on His part, glorious exaltation on our part!  But all these scriptures mean nothing, if human nature and Divine Nature are one and the same; or if man is in the likeness of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We, makes a distinction between the terms, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as applied to persons, the former being the foundation of the latter.  The nature is in the seed, but properly speaking, the form is not.  The apple nature, in a seed, will produce an apple tree. The tree has the form.  Human nature produces human forms, and Divine nature produces Divine forms. Those who in this age become partakers of the Divine nature, have the assurance, that &quot;when He shall appear we shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Him.&quot;  &quot;Who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body,&quot; &amp;c. `Phil. 3`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The terms form, likeness and image are used, in reference to persons interchangeably, and apply primarily to what we term body, though it may be proper to use them also in reference to mental conditions, as when the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Heart</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is used to represent the mind.  &quot;Son give me thine </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heart.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;I will create within you a new heart.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The term </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as used in the New Testament, evidently refers to humanity as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not to what covers our bones, in common parlance called flesh.  &quot;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.&quot; `John 3:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This passage is not designated to teach whether man is unit, dual or tripartite, (one, two or three) but simply, that which is produced by human beings is human, and that which is produced by the Divine Spirit is Divine.  &quot;The Word was made flesh,&quot; means simply, what is elsewhere taught in scripture.  That &quot;He was made in the likeness of men&quot;--became a human being.  As a human being--born of the flesh, he was a Jew.  But Jesus has been born again, not of the flesh, but of the spirit; &quot;The firstborn from the dead&quot; and as such is &quot;declared to be the Son of God.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That human beings as represented by &quot;The first man Adam&quot; are &quot;of the Earth, Earthy&quot; is clearly taught by Paul, `1 Cor. 15:47`.  Man made of the dust, is sustained from the ground, and returns thither again.  &quot;Naked came I from the Earth, and naked shall I return thither again.&quot;  All who are born of the flesh &quot;bear the image of the Earthy.&quot; (`Ver. 48,49`.)  Christ Himself in becoming our brother on the plane of the flesh, bore the same image. But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> born of the spirit having &quot;returned to the glory he had with the Father before the world was.&quot;  &quot;He is the brightness of His (Father's) glory, and the express image of His Person.&quot; `Heb. 1:3`.  That is, He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the likeness of man, but He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the likeness of God. Here we have the two likenesses fully developed in the same person. First the Natural, and afterward the Spiritual.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That the foundation for that spiritual body, was laid during His earthly life, in the spirit given Him without measure, we fully believe, but He was not, as a man (to leave out the idea of His Preexistence for in that He is an exception and not our Forerunner, of course) a fully developed spiritual being, until His Resurrection which was His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second birth.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He being the &quot;First Born from the dead.&quot; `Col. 1:18`.  He had the Divine </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nature,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before He was put to death but he was in human </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In His life, death, and resurrection, or in the process of development from the lower to the higher, from the Natural to the Spiritual, He is the Forerunner of His saints; the &quot;Head,&quot; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. `Col. 1:18`. He opens the way and Himself is our Leader.  All who ever enter the Heavenly life, and bear the Divine Image, as Sons of God, must go the way He went.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While in the flesh, which is the first or lowest stage of development, they, by the spirit of God imparted, become partakers of the Divine Nature. They are thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to a lively hope, which hope is consummated when they, like their Head, are borne from the dead.  Those thus begotten by virtue of the spirit given them, call God, Father, claiming Divine Sonship.  By faith they grasp the glorious realities of that Blessed Hope, and so count themselves, as God also counts them, in Christ, as on the Risen side, to die no more.  This is indeed a glorious privilege, and we can exclaim, as John says: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are we the sons of God, but,&quot; we add, which tends both to humility and encouragement, &quot;It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This order of development must be observed by us as it is by the Lord.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;First,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the natural, &amp;c.&quot; Some overlooking the order, and quoting from Paul, &quot;There </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a natural body, and there </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a spiritual body,&quot; conclude at once that both bodies exist together, and that at death the spiritual body leaves or is withdrawn from the natural body, and that this is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Resurrection.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  By this view they are forced to ignore the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Apostolic</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> teaching concerning the Resurrection and the coming of Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nothing is more simple than that death and resurrection are not at the same time.  &quot;As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive, but every man </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in his own order.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ, the first fruits, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">afterward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they that are Christ's at His coming. Even Christ was not raised until the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">third day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> after His death.  But they that are Christ's, no matter when they died, are raised at His coming. &quot;At the last trump,&quot; says Paul, and all must admit the seventh or last trumpet did not sound all the way through, as men have been dying.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The stress laid by some on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present tense</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the verb, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">be,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the passage: &quot;There is a natural body and there </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a spiritual body,&quot; is of no value as an argument.  It proves nothing.  &quot;Unto us a child </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> born,&quot; spoken by Isaiah hundreds of years before the birth of Christ, is understood by all.  In common language we say: &quot;As the twig </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> bent, the tree </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> inclined.&quot;  All understand it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the twig and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">afterward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the tree. &quot;As </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the child, so </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the man.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Describing the order of seasons in a year we may say: There </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Spring, it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> followed by Summer, &amp;c.  Paul was speaking on the same principle in reference to the order of human development, from the lower to the higher; and of its stages he says: &quot;There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:44`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The first half of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same verse</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shows that they do not exist together, but, &quot;It is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sown</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a natural body, it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raised</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a spiritual body.&quot;  But as if he were anticipating the caviling which would come, and determined to give a clear offset to it, he says: &quot;Howbeit that was not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which was spiritual, but that which is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (is first) and AFTERWARD that which is spiritual.&quot; (`Ver. 46`.) The whole passage is luminous with the glorious hope of Eternal life and glory at the coming of Christ, the Life Giver, at the last trump. &quot;As we have borne (in this life) the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">image</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the earthly, we shall also (in the future life) bear the image of the heavenly.&quot; (`Ver. 49`.)  Glorious promise and hope.  Here again is the positive evidence that here, in the flesh, men have not attained the likeness or image of God, but that it is something to be attained, when that which is perfect is come.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is, we are well aware, the general impression, and not without apparent good reason, that man was at first created, and is, in the image of God.  &quot;Let us make man in our own </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">likeness.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But the harmony will be seen by those, and those only, who will take a glimpse at God's revealed plan as a whole, and remember that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that is done on the plane of the flesh is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">preparatory,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life is only the first step in the plan of development.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It may be said that the first is typical of the second, or higher, to which the lower points.  The whole plan is built on the two phases, &quot;First the natural and afterward the spiritual.&quot;  There are two creations, two Adams, two Eves, two marriages, two births and two lives, and consequently the two likenesses.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R90 : page 3::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ, as already seen, was Adam-like, the first to enter the second, or higher life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R90 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">By his life, drawn from his side, so to speak, the church, Eve-like, derives her life, and being called out during the gospel, enters fully on her higher life at his coming to claim his Bride, when the marriage takes place.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then the plan reaches the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as on the plane of the flesh, none entered life excepting Adam and his wife until after their marriage, so none enter the higher--the Eternal Life--excepting Christ and his wife --the Church--until after the marriage of the Lamb.  Then follows the Regeneration.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The life to come is the perfect life, and until that is reached, we must ever speak of God's plan as in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">process</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not complete.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The New Testament is the complement of the Old, and it clearly reveals when and how we are to attain the maturity--the glory, the perfect day.  The prophetic eye of the Psalmist looked forward, and seeing the perfection of character and person combined, he exclaimed, &quot;I will behold thy face in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Righteousness.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I shall be satisfied when </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I awake in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thy likeness.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Psalm 17:15`.)</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">STAND FAST.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. `Gal. 5:1`.  To </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stand,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to adhere to fixed principles; or in other words, to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">steadfast,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> immovable, always abounding in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">work</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. `1 Cor. 15:58`.  We are frequently exhorted to stand; to be steadfast; to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">continue,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc.  Watch ye, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stand fast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the faith, quit you like men, be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">strong.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `1 Cor. 16:13`. Stand fast in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one spirit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with one mind striving for the faith of the gospel. `Phil. 1:27`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But no one can stand in his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">own</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> strength; so we are admonished to stand fast in the Lord. `Phil. 4:1`. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Take heed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">departing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the living God.  But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exhort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one another daily, while it is called to-day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  For we are made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partakers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">steadfast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">end.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Heb. 3:12,14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">steadfast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `2 Pet. 5:8-9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Stand fast therefore, in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">liberty,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wherewith Christ hath made you free.  But what </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the liberty, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">freedom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which we have in Christ?  But now being made free from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">end</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--not beginning--everlasting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Rom. 6:22`.  Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">promises;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that by these ye might be partakers of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine nature,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> having escaped the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">corruption</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that is in the world, through lust.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And besides this, giving all diligence, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">add</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> virtue or fortitude; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance--or self-control, Godliness; and to Godliness, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brotherly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">kindness;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and to brotherly kindness, love; for if these things be in you and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">abound,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they shall make you neither barren nor </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unfruitful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of our Lord Jesus Christ. `2 Pet. 1:4-8`.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has reference to something previously stated; so we read in `Gal. 4`.: When we were children, (under the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">law,)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we were in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bondage</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> under the elements of the world; but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law, to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redeem</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them that were under law, that we might </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">receive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the adoption of sons.  And because ye </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father.  Wherefore thou art no more a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">servant,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Son;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and if a son, then an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heir</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ.  How be it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are not Gods; but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And you, that were some time alienated and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enemies</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in your mind by wicked works, yet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hath he reconciled in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to present you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">holy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unblamable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and unreprovable in his sight; if ye </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">continue</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> grounded and settled, and be not moved </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">away</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard. `Col. 1:21-23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As ye therefore have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">received</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ Jesus the Lord, so </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">walk</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ye in him; rooted and built up in him, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stablished</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Beware</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> lest any man </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spoil</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you through philosophy and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">vain deceit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> after the rudiments of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not after Christ. `Col. 2:6-8`. Wherefore if ye be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Christ from the rudiments of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> why as though </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">living</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are ye subject to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ordinances,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> after the commandments and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">doctrines</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of men?  Touch not; taste not; handle not; which (ordinances) are all to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perish</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with their using. `Col. 2:20-22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, in `Gal. 4`., freedom in Christ is illustrated by an allegory. Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?  For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free woman.  But he who was of the bond-woman was born after the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but he of the free woman was by promise.  (They which are the children of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> these are not the children of God; but the children of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">promise</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are counted for the seed. `Rom. 9:8`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Which things are an allegory; for these are the two covenants; the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bondage,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is Agar.  For this Agar is, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">signifies,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Mount Sinai in Arabia, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">answereth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to Jerusalem which now is, and is in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bondage</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with her children.  But Jerusalem which is above is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">free,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is the mother of us all.  Now </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">promise.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Nevertheless what saith the scripture?  Cast out the bond-woman and her son; for the son of the bond-woman shall not be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heir</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the son of the free woman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bond-woman,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">free.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Stand fast </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the liberty or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">freedom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wherewith </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hath made us free, and be not entangled </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the yoke of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bondage.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In this condition, we are exempt from the works of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">old</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> law, and are under a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> law.  The law of the Spirit of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ Jesus, hath made us </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">free</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the law of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Rom. 8:2`.  Behold, I, Paul, say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall profit you nothing.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thoughts on the Lord's Prayer.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">`Matt. 6:9-13`</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The `17 chapter of John` is more properly the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lord's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> prayer, the earnest expression of his own heart. This, usually so called, is rather the disciple's prayer, learned from the Lord in answer to the request, &quot;Lord teach us to pray.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Coming from His lips it can not be unimportant.  We are impressed with its simplicity, brevity, and comprehensiveness. It contains no &quot;vain repetitions.&quot;  Christians should follow Christ rather than the heathen, who &quot;think they shall&quot; be heard for much speaking.&quot; `Ver. 7`.  Prayer is not designed as a lecture of suggestion or instruction to the Lord, for he knoweth what things we need before we ask. `Ver. 8`.  And yet he teaches us to pray.  It seems important that we should feel our need, and dependence on the Lord as the Giver.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R90 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">express</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our wants makes a deeper </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impression</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on our own hearts. Even </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">vocal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> prayer has thus an important use, though we are glad our Father recognizes even our thoughts, and &quot;is able to do exceeding abundantly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">above</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all that we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ask</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">think.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Eph. 3:20`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We do not regard this as designed for a stereotyped </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of prayer. There may be as much danger of mere formalism in repeating this as any other form of prayer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">manner</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the prayer on which Christ lays the stress.  &quot;After </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this manner,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> therefore, pray ye.&quot;  It is clear, childlike and pointed; and it is in harmony with God's plan. We should know what we want, and ask expecting to receive.  Prayer must be intelligent in order to be of faith, for faith is not feeling, but a depending on God's promises; it is taking him at his word.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is interesting to observe the divisions of this prayer.  It has three parts.  The first relates to God, the second to others, or the general cause, and the third to ourselves. This is important.  True prayer is</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R91 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">humble worshipful and unselfish-- &quot;Our Father&quot; first, ourselves last. He should be recognized first because of what he is and what he deserves. Let his sacred Name be spoken with reverence.  A careless use of God's name is profanity.  Morality relates to human relations Christianity includes both human and Divine.  A proper recognition of our relations to God will best secure the performance of our duty to humanity.  As God in man is man's hope, so to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">realize</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God, is the mainspring of life. For this reason doubtless God is placed first in the arrangement of the prayer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R91 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The prayer recognizes the plan of the ages, and the dispensational steps of advancement; and to lose sight of God's order of development is as unreasonable as to expect harvest without seedtime, or fruit before the tree is grown.  &quot;Our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Father&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> savors of the Gospel dispensation, which was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dawning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when Christ taught his disciples.  Former dispensations revealed God as Creator, Lawgiver and Judge, and the terrors of Sinai were characteristic of the effect produced on the minds of the people.  The gospel reveals him as a Father, and we as brethren. That was bondage; but God hath not given </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the spirit of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">adoption</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whereby we cry Abba--Father. `Rom. 8:15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The former church were mere servants and to them Christ came, but to as many as received him he gave power to become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sons.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Jno. 1:12`. This new name brings new and exalted privileges, even </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fellowship</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with God and his Son Jesus Christ.  This gives a new basis for action, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> instead of fear and leads to certain success.  The complete realization of this unity, is the prime element of our Blessed Hope.  For this the Saviour prayed--the marriage --&quot;That they all may be one,&quot; &quot;even as we are one,&quot; &quot;made perfect in one&quot; &quot;that the world may believe.&quot; `Jno. 17:20-23`.  This unity is thus shown to be not only the Christian's life and hope, but also the basis of the world's hope.  Certain it is that the world cannot be saved until after the church is glorified.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do we, when we say &quot;Our Father&quot; realize how much it means.  He that does not receive Christ as his Saviour and elder Brother cannot consistently or truthfully say &quot;Our Father.&quot;  This is the prayer of the disciples of Christ, or the son of God, not by Adam but by the Divine Nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The prayer is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prophetic.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The second part shows this.  In this it resembles the `17th of John`.  The fact that they were taught to pray &quot;Thy Kingdom come&quot; is an indication of God's plan, and the assurance of its success.  Prayer moved by the spirit will be answered.  &quot;Thy will be done in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Earth&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> finds its assurance in the promise.  &quot;The Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord,&quot; and its many kindred statements.  The coming of the kingdom must precede the state of holiness referred to.  In &quot;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,&quot; the relation of cause and effect between the two parts of the sentence is too often lost sight of.  The prayer, &quot;Thy will be done,&quot; is certainly appropriate to cases where, as individuals, we are subjected, in God's arrangements, to trying circumstances, as when Jesus said, &quot;Not as I will, but as Thou wilt.&quot;  But is it not too often applied where the circumstances are not of God, but of our own arrangement?  That this second phase of the prayer is for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">others,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> more than for ourselves, will be most appreciated by those who know the glorious truth that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">object</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for which Christ and the saints will reign is to bless the nations.  With this in view, the Christian's hope is unselfish.  As the joy set before Christ was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">well-being of others,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for which he endured the cross, and despised the shame, so for the same joy we can endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ; and as now in part, by and by to the full extent, we shall &quot;enter into the joy of our Lord.&quot;  Whoever can appreciate this fact concerning the coming kingdom, must of necessity appreciate the gospel dispensation and its privileges.  As we are being nourished for Christ and His work, all personal benefits are given by Our Father, and received by us as a means to a great end, and we can, for this reason, pray, &quot;Father, give us&quot;--to use for Thee.

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">NUMBER SEVEN.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Seven is a peculiar and much-used number in the bible.  It is the basis of reckoning in many prophetic arguments.  It is what may be termed a complete number.  It represents the whole of that to which it is applied, and the whole is often divided into seven parts.  It may be to others, as well as ourselves, both interesting and profitable to consider the relation of this number to the various elements of God's revealed plan.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The thoughtful reader of the bible may have been impressed with the oft-repeated use of this number. It suggests to our minds, in harmony with many other things, the idea of order in the plan.  The idea of the bible being a chance book cannot long be entertained by those who can see the systematic development in its revelations.  We believe the veil will be removed from the face of the nations (`Isa. 25:7`), by the manifestation of long-hidden truths, whatever means God may use to bring it about, and it is doubtless the duty and privilege of all who have any degree of light, to let it shine.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The first use of the number seven in the bible is in the formation of the week.  The creation week was seven days.  We do not assert that they were each twenty-four hours in length.  A day is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">any</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> specified period of time.  The twenty-four hour day, as is well known, is caused by the revolution of the earth on its axis. The evening and morning of such a day are caused by the sun's shining on each part of the earth half the time during the daily revolution. For this reason it seems clear that the creation days could not have been mere twenty-four hour days, because the record shows that the sun was not made to shine on the earth until the fourth creation day. `Gen. 1:14-19`.  Those days were doubtless long periods, as geologists claim, and yet the principle is made the basis of our ordinary week. Why should there be seven days in a week rather than some other number?  We regard it, of course, as of Divine arrangement.  Attempts have been made to change it, as when the French arranged one day in ten for rest, but it proved a failure. This cycle of seven is not caused by astronomy, as are the length of the day and the year.  We believe it is caused by the Divine impression of God's plan of salvation on the history of mankind. Can any skeptical friend suggest a better reason for this otherwise arbitrary arrangement?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are many reasons for believing that the seven days of a week are typical of the seven thousand years of the world's history. The statement that &quot;One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day&quot; (`2 Pet. 3:8`), is not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">proof</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the position taken, but it suggests that a thousand years, rather than a million or some other number, is one of the kinds of day used in God's plan.  According to the bible chronology, with which many of our readers are more or less familiar, the six thousand years from the creation of Adam ended in the year 1873, and the seventh thousand is therefore commenced.  Not only is the number seven made prominent, but in many cases the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seventh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is made specially prominent.  In six days the Lord made heaven and earth, but the seventh day is the Sabbath.  This prominence of the seventh day holds good in the week of creation, the ordinary week and the week of thousands.  The number seven is made prominent in several ways between the creation and the coming out of Israel from Egypt, but up to that time there is no bible evidence that the Lord commanded the observance of the seventh day, or that anyone did observe it, or that anyone was punished for its non-observance.  That the seventh day of the creation week is the rest-day of the Lord, and that He set it apart for some great purpose, are both true. `Gen. 2:2,3`. That the same principle of six days of work and the seventh day for rest (not any day of the seven, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seventh),</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was afterward made the basis of the ordinary week, is also true. `Ex. 20:8-11`. But there are reasons for believing that the grand object of the Lord in setting apart the seventh day, was to make it a type of the Great Sabbath, or seventh thousand years.  It may be asked: &quot;If the six thousand years are ended, and the seventh thousand is the Sabbath, why do so many of the conditions of the times past still continue?  We believe even this is foreshadowed in the stated facts concerning the seventh day of the creation week.  The work of the six days extended into and was ended in the seventh.  &quot;On the seventh day God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ended</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his work, and He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rested</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the seventh day.&quot; `Gen. 2:2`.  This double statement has often been overlooked, but the first is as true as the second, and there is a meaning in both.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are many evidences, which have been given from time to time, that the Millennium is to be introduced by a time of trouble, in which existing organizations are to be removed, as rubbish, to make way for the verdure of peace and righteousness which is to follow.  But there is another phase of this subject in which we are specially interested. The closing work of the old creation, before the generation of the family began, was getting a wife for Adam, and it would therefore appear that this was the work extended into the beginning of the seventh day.  It is often said that man is the noblest work of God; &quot;but the woman is the glory of the man.&quot; `1 Cor. 11:7`. This progression, from the lower to the higher, in creation, illustrates the progression, in God's plan of the ages.  The last work of the new creation, before the millennial work, is getting a wife--the</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R92 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">church--for the Second Adam, and, according to the evidences, this work is extended into the beginning of the seventh thousand years. With this in mind, we may see a significance in the promise of Christ to the overcomer: &quot;I will give him the morning star.&quot; `Rev. 2:28`. Christ is called both the &quot;Morning Star,&quot; and the &quot;Sun of Righteousness,&quot; and these seem to be related to each other as the &quot;day dawn&quot; and the &quot;perfect day.&quot;  When Christ rose from the dead, on the first day of the week, it was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;early,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">when it was yet dark.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Jno. 20:1`. It was in the dawn of the day, (`Matt. 28:1`), and this, together with the many evidences, seem to show that the same is to be true of the church in the dawn of this great day.  It is during this day-dawn, or transition between the Gospel Age and the Millennium, that Babylon is to go down to rise no more, as a millstone cast into the sea; and when this takes place, the holy apostles and prophets are called upon to rejoice over the destruction of that corrupt system. `Rev. 18:20,21`. The inference is, that the resurrection of these holy men of old takes place before Babylon falls. Then, indeed, they would have the &quot;morning star,&quot; and it would be very early in the morning, while it is yet dark to the world at large. It seems that it will require the terrible events of the day of wrath to awaken the world from its stupor, and bring them to the consciousness of the presence of the &quot;King of Kings and Lord of Lords.&quot;  There are several otherwise dark sayings</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R92 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of our Lord, that seem clear with the idea that the seven thousand years are known as seven days.  In answer to the statement of the Pharisees, &quot;Get thee out, and depart hence, for Herod will kill thee,&quot; He said: &quot;Go ye, and tell that fox: Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.&quot; `Luke 13:31,32`.  These days could not have been twenty-four-hour days in any case.  The third day could not have been the day of His death (even if that could have brought perfection), for in the `next verse` He added: &quot;Nevertheless I must walk to-day, and to-morrow, and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.&quot; This shows that He was not to be put to death until He had reached Jerusalem, and that it was not accomplished on the third day from the time He spoke.  His use of the word day in two senses in the same connection, without an explanation, is similar to His use of the word death in two senses in the statement: &quot;Let the dead bury their dead.&quot;  Even had He been put to death on the very day He used the language, He could have had no reference to His resurrection on the third literal day, for He did not do cures and cast out devils when He was dead.  There was a complete suspension of both physical and spiritual healing from the time He left their house desolate until the day of Pentecost.  Take the broad view that He spoke not merely of Himself, but of the body of which He is the Head, and that instead of twenty-four-hour days He meant thousand-year-days, and all seems plain.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was near the beginning of the fifth thousand years that He spoke. That was the &quot;to-day&quot; of His language; &quot;to-morrow&quot; was the sixth thousand, and the &quot;third day&quot; is the seventh thousand.  We cannot doubt that the physical cures that Jesus performed while in the flesh were used, partly, to represent the higher work of the healing of spiritual maladies.  On this principle, He, in and by His body--the church--has been doing His work, but in only a limited and imperfect manner.  The mortal phase of the church is always called His body-- even &quot;the whole body;&quot; `Eph. 4:16` --but it is so only in a preparatory and representative sense.  He is not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfected</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until all, both the living and the dead members, are glorified with Him.  As Eve was the glory of Adam, and his complement, so of the church in relation to Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While doing the work of Christ during the fifth and sixth thousand-year-days, the church has also been called upon to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suffer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Christ, and to have conformity to His death. `Phil. 3:10`.  Another dark saying of Jesus seems to represent this phase of the experience of His church. &quot;Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.&quot; `Jno. 2:19`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are told that He spake of the temple of His body.  This had of course, its primary fulfillment in Jesus personally.  He often showed that He would rise the third day. But what was true of Him personally on the third day, of twenty-four hours, is true of His body--the church--in the third day of a thousand years each.  Jesus was talking of the temple and this was what confused the minds of His hearers.  But the temple was a type of the church as well as a type of each member of the same.  Jesus was the temple of God, for God dwelt in him.  The body of each Christian is the temple of God, by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. `1 Cor. 6:19`.  And the whole church groweth into a holy temple for the habitation of God. `Eph. 2:20-22`.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">words</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that Jesus used referred to the type, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spirit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or meaning, of those words was the antitype.  All through the period of their sufferings, the church could be comforted with the assurance that when they suffered He, the sympathizing Friend, suffered with them.  &quot;Why persecutest thou me?&quot; `Acts 22:7-8`.  &quot;Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it unto me.&quot; `Matt. 25:40`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul declares that Jesus &quot;rose the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">third day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> according to the scriptures.&quot; `1 Cor. 15:4`.  He must have referred to the Old Testament, for the New Testament was yet unwritten.  But what scriptures foretold that Christ should rise the third day?  None directly, that we can find; but indirectly it is taught, like many other things.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When asked for a sign, the Saviour referred to Jonah as a sign, and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one that wicked generation could have.  The time that Jonah was in the deep, the Saviour Himself applies to the period of His own death.  It was not thirty-three years and a half, but &quot;He died, and rose again the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">third day.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But there can be no doubt that it has a broader if not a deeper meaning as we have applied it to the church.  We are satisfied that the reason that Christ rose the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">third</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> day, instead of any other, was to represent the days of the great plan, each day being a type of a thousand years.  What is true of the glorification of the church of Christ, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as to time,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has been shown to be true also of the restoration of Israel.  And if anyone who believes the many scriptures which teach the idea of their restoration, will read the prayer of Jonah, while he was buried in the deep, as recorded in the `second chapter of the book of Jonah`, he will have but little difficulty in seeing a type of the history of the nation of Israel since Jesus left their house desolate.  Another prophecy of the same thing and in very plain words may be found in `Hosea 6:1-3`.  &quot;He hath </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">torn,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and He will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us; He hath </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">smitten,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and He will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bind us up.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">After two days</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">revive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us: in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">third day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Is it true that the Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> always means a resurrection to spiritual life?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. Our English word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> signifies </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to raise up again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and it does not indicate whether the body or thing raised has any life.  The Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> translated resurrection seems to have a similar meaning--to raise up again.  In scriptural use it is understood to imply that the ones </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raised up have</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> since it is so stated sometimes, but that it always means a resurrection to spiritual life, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is not true.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> There shall be a resurrection </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(anastasis)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> both of the just and unjust-- All shall live again, but to rise spiritual beings, immortal &amp;c., is promised only to those who have part in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection.  &quot;Blessed and holy are all they that have part in the first </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[anastasis]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection; On such the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hath no power.&quot;  The natural inference is that those who arise in subsequent resurrections, are not blessed and holy and that over these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death has power.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In other words the teaching is, that the first class are raised with such a life as cannot die, (immortal) while all others are raised to a life which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">can be forfeited.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the teaching of Jesus and the Apostles the difference between these resurrections is clearly discernable as expressed in the Greek. (Our regular English version fails to show it properly.)  Thus, Jesus says that in THE resurrection (i.e. the special resurrection) they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like unto the angels &amp;c.  Paul knew that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would rise, but says, &quot;If by any means I might attain unto THE resurrection&quot;--the first-- the prize.  He knew that because Jesus had ransomed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all, all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must be released from death, but he knew also that to the realization of the &quot;exceeding great and precious promises&quot; of &quot;being like Him,&quot; and &quot;like unto the angels&quot;--possessing &quot;immortality&quot; i.e. such a condition of life that he could not die any more, nor be hurt of the second death; all these, as well as the sitting in the throne depended upon his attaining the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;first&quot;--&quot;THE resurrection.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The following texts show that the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> does not always mean </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raising to spiritual life.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Matt. 22:23`. &quot;Scribes say that there is no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(anastasis) resurrection.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Luke 20:27`. &quot;Deny that there is any </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(anastasis)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Luke 2:34`. &quot;This child is set for the fall and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(anastasis) rising again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of many in</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R93 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Israel.&quot;  Israel stumbled and fell as a nation as well as individually and is to rise again.  They did not fall from being spiritual bodies nor are they to rise in that way.  Again, `Heb. 11:35`, &quot;Women received their dead </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(anastasis) raised</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to life again.&quot; Were they raised to spiritual life or to natural?  The latter, certainly, Christ Jesus being the first born to the higher plane.  We read further-- &quot;Others were tortured...that they might obtain a better </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(anastasis) resurrection.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Better than </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">what,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> means </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a giving of spiritual life?</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. In the text--&quot;Woe unto them that desire the day of the Lord&quot;--how are we to understand the Prophet?  Why is there a woe on them?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. It cannot refer to those who are &quot;accounted worthy to escape;&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are to &quot;lift up their heads and rejoice.&quot;  I suppose it has reference to the great mass of the human family which Paul says is waiting and expecting--&quot;The earnest expectation of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">creature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> waiteth for the manifestation of the Sons of God.&quot; Yet mankind will be subjected to a great time of trouble before their expectations are realized.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quicken Your Mortal Bodies.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Please give me your explanation of the text, &quot;He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> bodies by His spirit that dwelleth in you.&quot; Does it refer to the resurrection of the saints at the coming of Christ referred to in `1 Cor. 15`.  If so, how shall we harmonize this statement with the one there made, viz.: &quot;It is sown a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body; raised a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body.&quot;  &quot;It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.&quot; Now, if God merely makes alive (quickens) the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body, would it be anything more than a living </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body?  Can </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be properly termed &quot;a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual body?&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. Undoubtedly a living </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body is not a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body; and Paul is not in the text quoted referring to the same thing as in `1 Cor. 15`. But before we explain, please read the text referred to, `Rom. 8:11`. Now read the ten preceding and the `five succeeding verses`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Christians die literally and will have an actual resurrection, as mentioned in `1 Cor. 15`, and elsewhere but they are frequently spoken of as dying in another sense, as in `Rom. 6:11`: &quot;Reckon ye yourselves to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">be</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R93 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> indeed unto sin, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">alive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Let not sin, therefore, reign in (control) your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> bodies,...but yield yourselves [while still </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> bodies] unto God, as those that are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">alive from the dead.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  So also in the text you quote.  The `preceding verse` declares that &quot;If Christ be in you, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body is dead,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but the spirit is alive, and in this `verse 11`, he assures that the power of God, which was mighty enough to raise up Jesus, is able and &quot;shall quicken our mortal bodies by His spirit which dwelleth in us.&quot;  In other words, the same spirit, by which we crucify the flesh and reckon ourselves </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is able to so </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">subdue</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and control this mortal body, that it will be alive and active, in harmony with our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or spiritual nature.  Would that more of God's children knew, experimentally, of this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and this quickening.  We become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">alive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> toward God just in proportion as we become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to sin.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Can the term </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be properly applied to any but that company of saints who will have part in the first resurrection?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. The term church signifies congregation.  The Greek is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ekklesia,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and signifies </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the called-out ones.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It would be, therefore, proper enough to apply it to any called-out company. In the New Testament use of the word, however, it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">almost</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> invariably used in reference to the first resurrection saints, of whom it is said: &quot;God did visit the Gentiles to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">take out</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of them a people for His name.&quot;  An exception to this rule occurs in `Acts 7:38`, where the word congregation--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ekklesia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--is applied to fleshly Israel.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Will dead saints be resurrected in their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal bodies,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and afterward </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> along with the living?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. We think not.  Paul is our authority for saying &quot;It is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raised</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a spiritual body&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;raised</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in incorruption&quot; --&quot;power,&quot; and &quot;glory.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:42-44`.)</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">OUR AUTHORITY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some facts relative to the return of the Jews mentioned in our last, seemed to directly point to the fulfillment of the prophecies relative to their return, that some seem disposed to question the reliability of our information, Bro. H. A. King writes, &quot;what is your authority for saying that Russia has enacted laws compelling the Jews to leave that country?&quot; (The peculiarity </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">noted,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was, that just as God had opened up Palestine so that the Jew might return and enjoy a measure of liberty, He, at the same time, was forcing them </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">from</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Russia where about one-third of all that people are living.) We answer, as Brok, that the public press is our authority and it certainly is a disinterested witness; for instance, we clip from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Pittsburg</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dispatch</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of to-day (March 29th) the following:</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Instead of the concessions expected before the anniversary of the Czar's accession to the throne, regarding the position of the Jews, there is increased severity.  The Jews are driven to represent themselves as Protestant Christians, to escape expulsion from St. Petersburg.

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When we speak of a sin forgiven it implies that a sin has been committed, and that the one who committed it is a sinner.  And when of Jesus it is written: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin of the world,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we realize somehow that the whole world are sinners and that Jesus is their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Redeemer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from all sin.  This is Paul's thought when he wrote: &quot;All have sinned.&quot; `John 1:1-10`, says: &quot;If we say we have not sinned, we make him (God) a liar.&quot; As </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all are sinners</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wages</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of sin is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we read: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hath passed upon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have sinned.&quot;  We are in a bad condition in two ways; first, our characters and lives are stained with sin--and secondly because so marred by sin we are cut off from life and placed in the grasp of death.  We are apt to take a superficial view of the matter and to think of being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">released from</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the thing chiefly to be desired, but this is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">false view.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If released from death and not from sin which causes death, you would again die.  You would die because as a sinner you would have no right to life. The wages or legitimate end of sin is death.  &quot;Sin when it is finished bringeth forth death and if you could be released from death a thousand times yet not forgiven the sin, you would again be obliged to die.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our real aim and desire should be to get forgiveness of sins, for then the penalty--death--can be removed legally.  And in fact when we are forgiven or justified in God's sight, he is bound by his own justice to release such a forgiven and justified one from death.  But can we obtain forgiveness of sins if God's punishment for sin was a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> penalty? Could he be just and forgive or excuse sin?  We answer, no; God's mercy and love can never be exercised at the expense of his justice. How then can we be forgiven?  We answer: &quot;The Lamb of God taketh away the sin of the world.&quot; `Jno. 1:29`. Yes says `John (1:35`) &quot;Ye know that he was manifested to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">take away</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our sins and in him is no sin.&quot; First, he was manifested, tried in all points yet without sin, that he might after being thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">proved,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> act as our High Priest and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;put away sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the sacrifice of himself.&quot; `Heb. 9:26`. He who knew no sin was made sin for us,&quot; i.e. on our account he was treated as though he were the sinner (`2 Cor. 5:21`), and God &quot;Laid upon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">iniquity of us all,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;We have redemption through his blood, even </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forgiveness of sins.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Col. 1:14`. &quot;The blood (life given i.e. death) of Jesus Christ </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cleanseth us from all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `1 Jno. 1:7`.  &quot;We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.&quot; `Eph. 1:7`.  Thus &quot;Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death for every man;&quot; therefore &quot;God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you;&quot; (`Eph. 4:32`.) because</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Jesus paid it all,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       All the debt we owe;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Sin had left a crimson stain,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       He washed it white as snow.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And because thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransomed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from sin with a price, even the precious blood of Christ, the &quot;sins are blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He shall send Jesus etc.&quot; `Acts 3:19`.  For</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R94 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">as God was just to punish for sin and would by no means clear the guilty, so also &quot;He is just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity&quot; since Jesus paid for us the price of our sins.  And if the sin is forgiven will not its wages--death --be abolished?  Yes, by ransoming us from sin Jesus obtained the right to destroy death; and when sin is abolished, it may well be asked-- &quot;O death, where is thy sting?  For the sting of death is sin.&quot;  THANKS be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Verily, as in Adam all die so, in Christ shall all be made alive.  All were condemned to death because of sin and all are justified to life again because &quot;Jesus paid it all.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But what shall we say of those who claim that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus was a sinner,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who claim that he died </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for himself,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that he appeared in the world on the &quot;lowest round of the ladder,&quot; a sinner among sinners merely to set us an example and by working his way up to life to show humanity how they could work their way up and each </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">win life for himself?&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We say: God pity them and show them the value of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;the blood of the cross,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Gal. 1:20`.) that it was because the penalty of our sin was death that &quot;He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross&quot; that we might be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forgiven.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Oh no; Add nothing to their burden, they will have enough to bear; They will find it a difficult task to do as he did--keep the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole law</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> blameless, and thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">work their way</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up to life.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They will in time find a necessity for &quot;forgiveness through His blood,&quot; of whom it was written --&quot;Ye shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sin.&quot;  By and by they will learn--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;What grace was in the Lamb of God,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Who died to make them free.&quot; The doctrine of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;forgiveness of sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through his blood&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Col. 1:14`) is the one on which the whole fabric of christianity is built.  It is the basis of all our faith and hopes as christians. If we are not forgiven, we cannot approach God as &quot;Our Father.&quot; He is not the father of sinners.  Unless forgiven we cannot approach God in prayer, for &quot;God heareth not sinners.&quot;  We must first have his forgiveness before any of the blessings are ours, as it is written: &quot;Being justified by faith (in the perfection of his offering) we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; And we must first be forgiven before we can receive the Holy Spirit, as Paul says: `Eph. 1:13`.  &quot;In whom ye also trusted after ye had heard the word of truth--the gospel (good news) of your salvation. (from sin, i.e. forgiveness.)  In whom also after ye believed that ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Brethren, &quot;Let us draw near (to God) with a true heart in full assurance of faith, (that our sins are forgiven) having our hearts sprinkled from a consciousness of evil, (sin) and our bodies washed in pure water&quot; (our fleshly nature cleansed by, and brought into harmony with the truth.) (`Heb. 10:22`.) and &quot;Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering,&quot; for, in this--God's way of forgiving sin.  &quot;The righteousness of God is manifested&quot; most beautifully and his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justice, mercy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all find harmonious expression for, &quot;Herein is manifested the love of God, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.&quot;</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CHRIST OUR PASSOVER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed for us; therefore, let us keep the feast.&quot; (`1 Cor. 5:7`).  The passover was one of the most important of the types given to the Children of Israel, and was ever observed by them as one of their most solemn feasts.  They kept it in remembrance of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">passing over</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of their first-born when the tenth plague was visited upon the first-born of Egypt. They commemorated it every year on the anniversary of the event, slaying a lamb each year on the fourteenth day of the first month. They saw only the type: We, instructed by the Holy Ghost through the apostles, are able to recognize the antitype as &quot;Christ our Passover Lamb slain for us&quot;--&quot;the Lamb of God.&quot;  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would pass upon us, were it not that our Lamb's blood is sprinkled upon us, but in Him we have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As the typical </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lamb</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was put to death on the fourteenth of the first month, so our Passover Lamb was put to death on the same day.  No other day would fulfill the type, and so it was, as we read, `Luke 22:7`. As they feasted on the typical lamb, we feast on our Lamb.  It was on this same day that Jesus gave to the apostles the symbols of His broken body and shed blood, saying: &quot;THIS do in remembrance of me;&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> keep </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> feast hereafter, thinking of me as your Lamb.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It has for several years been the custom of many of us here in Pittsburgh to do </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this; i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> remember the Passover, and eat the emblems of our Lord's body and blood, and it has ever been an occasion of solemn pleasure and communion, and was particularly so this year.  We met on the night of March 24th, as usual, at the house of Brother and Sister Conley (it being the most commodious); and ate together the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unleavened</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> bread--eating, meantime </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which it symbolized, viz: That Jesus was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unleavened</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (without sin), holy, harmless, undefiled, and therefore food &quot;of which, if a man eat, he shall never die.&quot;  We said, with Paul, &quot;Christ, our Passover is slain; therefore, let us keep the feast.&quot;  We saw clearly that because we had Christ within, therefore (soon, we believe), all the church of the first-born will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">passed over,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and spared, as it is written: &quot;I will spare them, as a man spareth his only son that serveth him,&quot; and we said one to another, &quot;Watch that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things coming upon the world, and stand before the Son of Man.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We read, also, how that if we are Christ's, we are part of the same loaf; to be broken as He was; to die, as He did to the flesh--crucifying the flesh.  &quot;The loaf, which we break, is it not the communion of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ?  For we, being many, are one loaf and one body.&quot; (`1 Cor. 10:17`.)  We saw, also, that if we would count ourselves parts of that loaf, and be broken, we must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;purge out therefrom the old </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">leaven&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of sin, that we may be like our Master, &quot;who knew no sin.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">After supper, we took the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cup</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the wine.  As we took it, we remembered that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was not represented by the type, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">passover supper,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but that it was the symbol of joy and life.  After supper, He took the cup,... saying, &quot;Drink ye all of it,&quot; and we realized that, when the present night of eating the Lamb with bitter herbs (afflictions) has passed, our Lord will give us the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and new joys, saying, &quot;Enter thou into the joys of thy Lord,&quot;  And we realized, even now and here, a foretaste of those joys of Paradise.  Thus, the wine of our feast was but typical of the joys of the kingdom, when we shall drink it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Him, in our Father's kingdom--&quot;after supper.&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the title of the new book referred to in our Feb'y No. we are pleased to know that it will soon be ready--probably about May 1st. The table of contents before us, show it to contain 28 chapters (probably from 350 to 400 pages.) on subjects of deepest interest to all of us.  It will we doubt not supply a long felt want, viz: A book containing a connected and well expressed account, of our understanding of the prophecies their import and teaching as well as their harmony with the other teachings of God's word.  In a word &quot;The Law,&quot; &quot;The Prophets&quot; and &quot;The Gospel&quot; and their unity.</font><br />
