<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to ‘‘fill the earth&quot; with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THOSE THAT FORGET GOD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.&quot;—Ps. 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TEHOVAH has made known his fixed rule, as set I forth in the above text, and which rule applies </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font5"> to all persons or nations that at one time pretended or claimed to serve Him and then turned away from and against the Most High. The text, therefore, is a warning from Almighty God given to all those who have assumed the obligation of serving him. He compels no one to serve him, but when they undertake it they must bear the responsibility of fulfilling their covenant. One may enter into an actual covenant with God to do his will, while others may be in an implied covenant to do the will of God by reason of their information and outward claim of being the servants of God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The “wicked” are those who have received some light of truth of and concerning Jehovah’s purpose and who by reason thereof start in the way of righteousness, and who then forsake the pathway of righteousness and turn to lawlessness. Lucifer was an enlightened one, made acquainted to some extent with the purpose of Almighty God; was appointed to a high position in the organization of Jehovah, and thereafter rebelled against God, and since then has pursued a way of lawlessness. For that reason he is called “the wicked one”, and bears the names “Satan”, “Serpent,” “Dragon,” and “Devil”, all of which bespeak wickedness. Because of his wickedness Satan is sentenced by Jehovah to everlasting destruction, which judgment will be executed in God’s due time. His fate or destiny is the fate or destiny of all men and nations that take a like course. God does not change, neither do his rules change. God is no respecter of persons. He makes known his rules, and the creature who agrees or undertakes to obey them must perform or take the consequences.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Set over in exact contrast with the wicked are those who have covenanted to do God’s will and who faithfully and steadfastly abide by that agreement and carry out their covenant; and concerning such it is written: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” (Ps. 33:12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> The destiny for such is life everlasting in peace, joy and glory forever in the presence of the Most High. That blessed “nation” is the nation of which Christ Jesus is the Head, including all who are made members of God’s capital organization under Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The purpose of Almighty God he works out and puts into operation exactly on time and in his due time. He first approved certain individuals who voluntarily and faithfully devoted themselves to him and shunned the course of lawlessness, and who were diligent to serve God. Then, as a people for his purpose, he selected the Israelites and made a covenant with that nation. Israel was a typical nation, and the course thereof foretold and foreshadowed God’s purpose of selecting from amongst men a people for his name, to be used with Christ Jesus in his kingdom, and which is God’s “holy nation”. The antitypical nation of Israel is the nation of God “chosen for his own inheritance”. Now God’s due time has come when he, by and through Christ Jesus, is gathering unto himself his “other sheep”, that is to say, that company of persons that shall form the “great multitude”. In view of this fact it is now of very great importance that those “other sheep”, known also today as “Jonadabs” and who shall form the “great multitude”, should be enlightened concerning what is required of all who undertake to be the servants of God and Christ. What God has caused to be written in his Word of and concerning others that have gone before serves to furnish a guide to those who are now seeking the way of faithful service and everlasting life. Hence </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> briefly reviews the matter set forth in the Bible concerning God’s rule, which applies to those who claim to be walking in the way of righteousness as God’s servants. The warning given by Jehovah in his Word, and which has applied to others in times past, should now serve as a warning to the Lord’s “other sheep”, that they, having fled to the “city of refuge”, may keep themselves within bounds and faithfully serve the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> While the descendants of Israel were domiciled in Egypt Jehovah God selected them as a people for his name and made a covenant with them and by the hand of Moses led them out of Egypt. At Mount</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Sinai God confirmed that covenant, giving to the Israelites his law at the same time. Then God led them on a long journey to the land of Canaan, and, while on that journey, they were subjected to severe tests to determine whether or not they would love the Lord God, who had delivered them from Egypt. After reaching Canaan the nation of Israel was put to many other tests. When that typical nation kept covenant with the Lord and obeyed the Most High they were favored by him. That the Israelites understood that they were to be obedient to God’s law is clearly shown from the Scriptures. That nation had solemnly promised God to do and perform his will, and the Scriptures showed that they knew that they must do his will in order to receive his blessing. (Ex. 19:3-8) The Israelites knew that they could not forget God and their covenant with impunity. They were specifically warned against religion and told that they must keep away from and avoid such. That warning was to enable them to walk in the way of righteousness and receive God’s blessing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> When the Israelites refrained from having anything to do with the demon gods, or religion, and when they served God sincerely, they were free from taint; but as soon as they stretched out their hand to the religionists then they became defiled. In order to test their integrity God permitted them to suffer at the hands of religious practitioners and their persecutors. It was under such conditions that the following Psalm was written: “For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god [such as saluting flags or images, or giving praise and worship to creatures and things, indulging in religious formalism]; shall not God search this out! for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.”—Ps. 44:16-21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah, thus dealing with his typical covenant people, made known to them his rule that discipline must be applied to all who receive his approval and that often that discipline brings a severe test upon his chosen people. Long thereafter the apostle restated that divine rule relative to discipline as applied to the antitypical or spiritual Israelites, showing that the rule applies to all who enter into a covenant to do God’s will. (Heb. 12: 5-13) The nation of Israel did forget God and their covenant with him. They failed to give heed to his warning concerning religion or idolatry. Their leaders turned to tradition and forgot and ignored the Word of God and thus made God’s Word of none effect toward aiding his people. Hence Jehovah enforced his judgment against that nation by completely destroying it. (Ps. 106:36,37; Matt. 23:38) That nation, destroyed as such, never again can exist. There were some individuals amongst the Israelites, however, that remained true and faithful to God, and these were approved by him and shall have his everlasting blessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ Israel’s destiny foreshadowed the destiny of “Christendom”, that is, the nations that call themselves “Christian”, because such nations openly declare themselves to be the servants of Almighty God. Such nations, therefore, are in an implied covenant to be obedient to God. The things that came to pass upon Israel, the typical nation, were ensamples, or types, of what must come to pass at the end of the world affecting particularly those nations that claim to be Christian nations. “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he stand-eth take heed lest he fall.”—1 Cor. 10:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CHURCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’“The church of the living God” is the “church of the firstborn”, composed of Christ Jesus and the members of “his body” in glory. (1 Tim. 3:15; Heb. 12: 22, 23; Eph. 1: 22, 23) The church is the “holy nation” of Jehovah, devoted wholly and entirely to the service of Almighty God. It is the chosen inheritance of Jehovah which shall be forever to his praise. “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.”—1 Pet. 2: 9,10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> That holy nation has but dne God, who is Jehovah, and concerning which it is written: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.” Those who enter into a covenant to become a part of that nation must follow righteousness, and, they failing to do so, their destiny is destruction: “Righteousness exalteth a nation : but sin is a reproach to any people.”—Prov. 14: 34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Companies or congregations of the church began to be established by the apostles of Jesus Christ, who went about and gathered together Christians that they might be instructed and grow up in a knowledge and wisdom of the Lord. Such companies or congregations met for study and worship in the private homes, and these companies were called “the church” because they were prospective members of the church: “Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.” (Col. 4:15,16) “Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.” (Rom. 16: 5; Philem. 2) These and many other scriptures show that the church of God is not an organization ruled by man or a company of men. Christ Jesus is the Head and Ruler of the church, by the will of Almighty God. The Lord Jesus began to choose the members of the church when he was on the earth in the flesh. After his resurrection and ascension into heaven he sent his apostles forth, who went about preaching the true gospel and baptizing those who came to the Lord and entered into a covenant to do his will. The apostles made no effort to organize and arbitrarily rule the body, which body should have its own fixed rules and regulations; but they did appoint servants in the congregation who were to aid, direct and comfort the congregation by and with the Word of God. It was after the apostles had finished their earthly existence that the organization became defiled and selfish men, called “the clergy”, were put in control.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> “Catholic” means “general” or “universal”, and is not a name that properly belongs to a religious organization. For some time after the apostles’ time the term “Catholic” was applied to the entire body of Christian people who worshiped God in spirit and in truth. It then included all the Christian people throughout the earth. Later there was a separation between the western and eastern companies and the western division assumed the title “Catholic” and the eastern took the name “Orthodox”, and each became a religious institution in due time. It was after the Reformation that the organization at Rome asserted its claim to the exclusive use of the name “Catholic”. Undoubtedly in the earlier days there were genuine and faithful Christians in both the eastern and the western organization above mentioned. But gradually ambitious men came into power in the organization. The translation of the Scriptures into the Latin called “the Vulgate”, and which name means the “common” edition of the Scriptures, was done mostly by Jerome, a very devout man. It seems certain that he was devoted fully to the Lord God and to Christ Jesus. There must have been many others of such unselfish men during the early days of the Christian era. The Roman Catholic organization has since adopted the Vulgate as the official Bible of that organization; and the Douay Version, used generally by the Catholic organization, was translated from the Vulgate. No doubt there have been sincere men among the servants and priests of the Catholic Church organization, and which is called “the Catholic Church”, even though the name “church” does not properly belong to that organization. It is the doctrines and practices of the Catholic organization that are in complete conflict with the Word of God, and for this reason attention is called to the same from time to time. It is never proper or right to ridicule any man or group of men because they are Catholic, but it is entirely right and proper to call attention to the fact that the Catholic organization has turned away from the Bible and forgotten God. The purpose of this is to enable those sincere Catholic persons to see and appreciate their privilege to flee from religion and flee to the Lord under the protection of the King of the great Theocracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The term “Catholic Church” strictly means the controlling or ruling body of authority, called “the Hierarchy”. That body of men in control was organized long after the days of the apostles and after the days of the early Christians. The many members of the Catholic Church organization are called “the children of the church”, and these have nothing to say about the government of that body. Ambitious men organized and gained control of the Roman Catholic organization, which is now devoted to religion and politics. Catholic doctrines and “Catholic Action” show that the organization as such has forgotten God. Sincere' Catholic men and women have separated themselves from that “church” organization and have freely set forth the facts showing the reason why a true and sincere Christian cannot remain in it. As proof that the Catholic “church” organization has fallen away from the Bible and forgotten God the followingquotations set out below are taken from a book entitled “Rome Stoops to Conquer”, written by a sincere Catholic, Doctor Barrett, and published in 1935:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“A large proportion of Catholic Action partakes of politics, and is a political penetration, an infiltration into the political world of a new force and agency. . . . 'That the Catholic Church is, to say the least, certainly one of the major forces of the world ... is generally admitted.’ This ‘admittedly major force of the world’ is focused today on the problem of the future of this country. . . . Catholic Action ... in practice ... is the Catholic group fighting their way to control America. . . . There was a time —it is now past—when only pious Catholics took part in the work of the Church. But today many Catholics who cannot qualify as pious are busy about Catholic Action. Catholicism now is something that partakes of clannishness, and that is constituted in large part by social and political and ‘club’ affiliations.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Then Doctor Barrett quotes from a high Catholic official these words, which appear in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> January 7, 1935: “Catholic men should unite in order to be able to tell legislatures that they must not introduce bills which are inimical to the ideals of the family or the ideals of the Catholic Church. They should organize so as to be strong enough to insist that school teachers who teach ‘pernicious doctrines’ be removed.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>15</sup> The Converted Catholic,</span><span class="font5"> a magazine published by sincere men who withdrew from the priesthood of the Catholic organization, in its issue of June, 1940, published the following: Hitler’s “objectives are the same as those sought for four centuries by Jesuit-led Catholicism in its efforts to destroy the effects of the Reformation. Nazi-fascist dictators, all products of the Catholic Church, have supplied the means that are rapidly bringing these objectives to realization.” “In Germany and in Central Europe Hitler has undertaken to destroy entirely all freedom of the spirit, and his attack can be placed in the win column of the Catholic Church.” “Catholic Action in the United States is feverishly working for ‘the organization of a corporative movement and the creation of a corporative state’.” ’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WORSHIP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> Compulsory worship is an abomination in the sight of God even as hypocrisy is abominable: “God is a spirit; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” (John 4:24) Because that old, religious system persecuted men in Europe and compelled them to indulge in formal religious ceremonies or suffer severe bodily punishment, sincere men and women immigrated to the new land of America, where they might worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. Organizations composed of sincere believers in God and in Christ sprang up throughout America and then the nation advanced. States were formed and organized and in due time these states united in what is since known as the United States of America and became the nation where it was declared that every man has the right to worship God in his own way, which does not do injury to others. The states each adopted a constitution or fundamental law, in which Almighty God is recognized as supreme, and in which it is declared that the people have a right to worship God in spirit and in truth according to their conscience. The states separately and unitedly thereafter called themselves Christian, and the nation of America has since claimed to be a Christian nation. The highest court of America in terms declared: “This is a Christian nation.” By the course of action of the states and of the nation America became a part of “Christendom”, and is in an implied covenant to obey the law of Almighty God, and to refrain from enacting or enforcing any law that is contrary to the law of Almighty God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Eminent law-writers have proclaimed the true doctrine that all laws of the nations find their authority only in the law of God. The constitution of the United States provides that Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, thus recognizing that every man is free to worship or not to worship as he may be moved by his own conscience and sincere desire to serve God. But since the year 1914 the states and the nation have taken a contrary course. Many of the states attempt by law to forbid the freedom of worship in the manner God has prescribed in his Word and, contrary to God’s Word, attempt to compel the people to indulge in certain forms of worship. The states and the nation have clearly forgotten God and his law, which must govern all that are in an actual or in an implied covenant to do God’s law.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> All the nations of Europe have claimed to be Christian nations, and thereby all together form what is generally known as “Christendom”. In each and every one of these nations the Bible has been published and recognized for a time as God’s Word. By their claim and course of action such nations entered into an implied covenant and recognized and agreed to obey the law of God. All these nations, as the indisputable facts show, have forgotten God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> All the nations of “Christendom” have received the warning by and through the Word of God that “righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people”. (Prov. 14: 34) Not only have the nations had the Word of God, by which they could have been properly guided, but they have had the history of the experiences of others that have gone before and have been destroyed because they had forgotten God and his Word. Jehovah God brought the flood upon the world, which destroyed all save eight persons, Noah and his family. This He did because that people pushed aside and wholly ignored God’s Word. This forms a warning to “Christendom”, but “Christendom” has forgotten to give heed to that warning. “Christendom” has forgotten that God vindicated his name by the flood and that he will likewise vindicate his name by destroying all who turn away from him. “Because they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.”—Ps. 28: 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIGHTING GOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The nations of “Christendom” have forgotten that God long ago declared his purpose to rule the world by his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, and that God gave warning to all rulers to receive and support Christ the King, or otherwise suffer the consequences: “Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.”—Ps. 2:10-12.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Instead of supporting the King, the nations fight against him and against Jehovah and persecute those servants of God who tell the people of his righteous government, The Theocracy. In every nation of “Christendom” the servants of Jehovah and his King are persecuted, and the Lord Jesus Christ counts such treatment as done unto himself. Therefore God’s servants pray the prayer which he recorded in his Word and taught them to pray, to wit: “Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in thy sight. Put them in fear, O Lord; that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.” (Ps. 9:19, 20) It is certain, therefore, that all nations shall soon know that Jehovah is the Mighty God and that puny man cannot successfully fight against him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The “times of the nations” have come to an end, and of that all the nations that have had the Bible have received due warning. That end of the nations under Satan’s uninterrupted rule came in 1914, when Christ Jesus was enthroned as King of The Theocracy. (Luke 21:24) Christ Jesus, the great Judge, now has before him all the nations for judgment, and he is judging and separating the obedient from those who have forgotten God. By their course of action those opposing The Theocracy are all put on the side or in the group of those who have forgotten God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Christians have been duly warned of the Lord to keep themselves separate and apart from the politics and commerce and military rule of this wicked world. The religious institutions that claim to be Christian have forgotten the Word of God concerning such, and which plainly states: “For the worship that is pure and holy before God the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, and that one keep himself unspotted from the world.” (Jas. 1: 27, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Syriac)</span><span class="font5"> “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” (Jas. 4: 4) All the religious institutions today participate in the political affairs of this world, even though the Scriptures and the facts show beyond any question that Christ Jesus is now present putting his kingdom in operation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> The nations of Italy and Germany for centuries have claimed to be Christian nations, and within those nations there have been many faithful and true witnesses to the name and kingdom of Jehovah. Today those two nations are ultra-religious and are engaged, with the full co-operation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that old religious institution, in a wicked and bloody effort to compel all the people to come under dictatorial power. Falsely and arbitrarily those religious leaders claim to operate in the name of God, and yet they ignore entirely his Word and hesitate not to kill the servants of God. Not only do such nations prosecute a cruel and wicked war, which has brought great suffering and mourning upon the people, but they blaspheme and reproach the name of God and his King. Those nations, together with the other nations that have claimed to be Christian, have forgotten God’s “everlasting covenant” concerning the sanctity of human blood. They go on, ruthlessly and wickedly, in the destruction of human life. Therefore says Jehovah concerning them: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.”— Isa. 24:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> Many professed “Christian nations” provide their church basements with implements of war and destruction contrary to the Word of God. They join their forces with others engaging in mortal combat to gratify ambitious desires to gain power and control of the people. Such deplorable conditions Jehovah by his prophet long ago foretold, and that the net results would be as stated in the following texts: “The earth mourneth, and fadeth away; the world languisheth, and fadeth away; the haughty people of the earth do languish. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.”—Isa. 24: 4, 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VERY </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">religious</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> Forgetting their covenant with God, the Israelites became very religious and turned to demon practices, and in this they foreshadowed “Christendom” and concerning which Jehovah says: “For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities [failing to rely upon God’s promise for defense and protection] ; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.”—Hos. 8:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> A similar condition was also foretold by the apostle, which would obtain in the “last days”, where we now are, and this serves as a warning to the faithful that they should avoid all religious practices or demonism, to wit: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away.”—2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> In these days of great world distress and suffering, made so by reason of the Devil’s activities as foretold by the Lord (Rev. 12:12), the religious leaders of the world, forgetting God’s commandment, set specific times for public prayers for peace. At these appointed times they draw nigh to God with their mouths, but with no heart devotion whatsoever to Jehovah and his King. They desire to receive that which pleases them, but ignore God’s will. The Jew religionists did so, and now the religionists of the nations of “Christendom” do likewise. Therefore says the Lord Jehovah: “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me [inside their cathedrals and temples], but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark [where conspiracies are hatched against the Theocratic servants], and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? Surely your turning of things upside down [putting the state above God, and man’s law above God’s law] shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay [subject to the will of the potter]; for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?” (Isa. 29:13-16) Therefore the nations and theii’ religious, political leaders are made ‘vessels fit for destruction’ at Armageddon, as the Lord declares.— Rom. 9:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> In these days of peril the religionists are exactly in a state like unto that of the Pharisees in Jesus’ time. (Matt. 15:1-9) The religious leaders convince themselves that they are right, and therefore rely upon their own wisdom, and this is due to the fact that they have forgotten God and his Word. Concerning such it is written: “There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.” (Prov. 14:12) “The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.”—Prov. 12:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Pastors of religious organizations other than the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have forgotten that the only true guide for the Christian is God’s Word. Becoming wise in their own conceits, they turn to imperfect reasoning of men and proclaim man’s so-called “wisdom” in the place and stead of God’s Word. A well-known pastor of a religious organization recently, by radio, made a statement to this effect: “Christianity is progressive. The world is piogressing in Christianity and in due time will reach perfection.” Had he relied upon God’s Word he would not have made that statement. Christ Jesus is the great Christian, and hence Christianity is perfect, and not progressive. Christ is the “express image” of Almighty God, and all His works are perfect and “done in righteousness”. All true followers of Christ Jesus are guided by the Word of God. It being perfect at all times, it is not progressive from a lower to a higher degree. Religious leaders, such as the pastor above mentioned, by relying upon human philosophy waste and destroy in the minds of others the Word of God; and concerning such it is written: “For the pastors are become brutish [wasters, destructive as by fire], and have not sought the Lord; therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.”—Jer. 10:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> The pastors or religious teachers claim to represent God and, instead of teaching the Word of God, teach the wisdom or tradition of men, and thereby not only have they forgotten God, but they do harm to those persons who stay under their teaching. They steal from the people the Word of God and substitute therefor the doctrines of men. It was so amongst the Israelites, and hence what God said to the pastors of the Jews applies with even stronger force now to the pastors of “Christendom”, who claim to teach the Bible and who ignore the same. Such pastors are called “prophets” because they proclaim, and concerning them it is written: “I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams, which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal. The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Lord. Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that steal my words everyone from his neighbour. Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the Lord, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies; and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord.”—Jer. 23: 25-32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> The Israelites were God’s covenant people, and they forgot God. “Christendom” claims to be God’s covenant people and has forgotten God. The Word of God spoken against those who forget him applies both to Israelites and to professed Christians: “Because my people [‘Christendom’, the professed people] hath forgotten me, they have turned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up; to make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head. I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity. Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah [Jehovah’s witnesses, of which Jeremiah was one, and who foreshadowed the present-day witnesses of Jehovah] ; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet: come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.”—Jer. 18:15-18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EVIL SERVANT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Christ Jesus tells of the action and the destiny of the “evil servant”. Such have forgotten God and his commandments. Once claiming to be for the Kingdom, now such show by their course of action that they have forgotten God, and to them Jehovah says: “But ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain [the Kingdom, The Theocracy], that prepare a table for that troop [Gad; a demon (see margin)], and that furnish the drink offering unto that number [Meni; a demon (see marginal reading)]. Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.”—Isa. 65:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> The “evil servant” smites the witnesses of Jehovah and thus fights against The Theocracy, and their destiny is the same as that of the hypocrites: “And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 24: 51.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UNGODLY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> There are those who have had every opportunity to know the Word of God and have spurned it. The evolutionists, many of whom pose as preachers in some church organization, deny the Word of God and teach their students and parishioners at colleges and school to ignore the Word of God. They do not believe in God and His Word because they are wise in their own conceits. The day of judgment has come and Christ Jesus, the great Judge, accompanied by his host of angels, now judges the nations. (Matt. 25: 31-35) Concerning the same it is written: “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”—Jude 14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> The religious leaders, the “man of sin”, the “evil servant”, the ungodly, and the sinners, utter cruel speech against the faithful servants of Jehovah who declare his name and his Theocratic Government, and bring much trouble upon such faithful servants of the Most High. Therefore it is written of them, and which applies at the present time: “seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, rest with us; when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.”—2 Thess. 1: 6-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> If any person thinks that the religious systems have not corrupted the nations of earth, that person is deceived. God has not left the matter in doubt. The religions of earth, the product of demons, have brought about great confusion; and hence demon organizations, with religion riding on the top, are called “Babylon”; and concerning this it is written : “Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord’s hand, that made all the earth drunken; the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed; howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.” (Jer. 51:7-9) In further support of that conclusion the Lord says: “And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."—Rev. 18: 2-4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WARNING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” This warning is sounded by the Lord for the benefit of all persons of good-will toward The Theocracy. Such as heed the warning will speedily flee out and away from religious organizations and find safety under the Lord Jesus Christ. Those who believe God and his Word should now see and understand that God is not a respecter of persons or nations, and that all who have learned of Jehovah and his kingdom and have then forgotten God and turned away to the “beggarly elements” of the world, and also all who fail and refuse to hear and obey God and his King, shall go down at Armageddon, which is near. God’s judgment is written, and it is certain to be executed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>39</sup> But before the execution of his judgment the Lord sends forth his witnesses to declare his name and his kingdom throughout the earth. This he does for a witness, in order that the nations may have no excuse for their course of action and end. They fix their own destiny. Therefore the Lord sends forth his servants with this commandment, which they must obey: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> The fact that in all the nations Jehovah’s witnesses are now hated and persecuted is strong circumstantial evidence that the witness work is about completed and that Armageddon is very near. Because many have forgotten God and become enemies of God and of his servants the words of the prophet now apply to them, to wit: “My zeal hath consumed me; because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. Thy word is very pure; therefore thy servant loveth it. I am small and despised; yet do not I forget thy precepts.”—Ps. 119:139-141.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“ With the zeal that belongs to the “house [or organization] of the Lord” the faithful remnant and their companions now say, as God has taught them: “0 worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; fear before him, all the earth. Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people righteously.” (Ps. 96:9,10) Those who are of good-will toward God will now hear the glad news and hasten to the Lord that they may have a share in proclaiming his name and his kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The remnant of God’s “holy nation” still on the earth have not forgotten God. The “other sheep” of the Lord now fleeing to the antitypical “city of refuge” do not forget God and his “wonderful works to the children of men”. Such “other sheep” continue faithful and in due time will form the “great multitude” and constitute the “nations” that shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth”. Therefore Jehovah now says to the remnant and to his “other sheep”: “Rejoice, 0 ye nations, with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.”—Deut. 32:43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> The “great multitude” is taken from the various nations, kindreds, people and tongues and shall form the new nations of the earth. God’s spiritual class, now with Christ Jesus, and having in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mind at all times the name of Jehovah, sing: “Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name! for thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.” (Rev. 15:4) Those who are of good-will toward God hear the glad song and hasten to join the singers in doing service to the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DESTINY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> The judgment of the nations is now in progress, and hence all are before Christ Jesus, the great Judge. The religious organizations claim to serve God, but they have forgotten him and his Word and have turned entirely to the things of this world. Such religious institutions join forces with political and commercial strong men, and together they say, "We will rule the earth.” They have forgotten that Jesus directs all Christians to pray for the coming of The Theocracy, which shall rule the world in righteousness. (Matt. 6:10) Religious great men and their political allies assert their claim to rule the world, and thus, together, they constitute “the abomination of desolation”. This truth now plainly appears to all persons of good-will, and to such the Lord now says: “But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains.”— Mark 13:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> The Lord here also warns those who start to flee that they must not turn back, and that if they do turn back and forget God and his provision for them their destiny will be the same as that of others who forget God. Such are put in the same class with the wicked, the “evil servant” and the hypocrites, and the destiny of such the Lord declares in these words: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” (Ps. 9:17) “The Lord pre-serveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.”—Ps. 145: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>46</sup> Those who are of good-will toward God and who desire life must now flee: “For the day of the Lord [Armageddon] is near upon all the heathen [the nations that are against The Theocracy] ; as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen [the nations that are against The Theocracy] drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.” —Obad. 15,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE “OTHER SHEEP”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>47</sup> Those of good-will, the “other sheep” of the Lord, who will form the “great multitude”, must be faithful, and will be to the everlasting praise of Jehovah and the vindication of his name. All such, who have now taken the step to put themselves on the side of the Lord, must see to it that they do not forget God. What must one do to avoid that calamity! Shun religion, because it is demonism. Avoid the vain babblings of so-called worldly “wise men” and study to show yourself approved unto God. (2 Tim. 2:15,16; 1 Tim. 6:20,21) Do not lean to your own selfish reasoning, nor to that of any man: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” (Prov. 3:5,6) That means, in everything you have, acknowledge the Lord God and, in everything you receive at his gracious hands, acknowledge him and give him the thanks for the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> To “seek meekness” means to be willing to learn and diligent to ascertain the will of God; and this you must do by continuously applying yourself to the study of God’s Word. It is of vital importance that you learn God’s way, because that is the way of righteousness. “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.”—Ps. 25: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>49</sup> The enemies of all of God’s people are many. Satan, the chief of demons, leading a host of demons associated with him; the religionists of earth, who practice demonism; and all who are under the influence and power of demons, are fighting against the covenant people of God. All such hate those who have declared themselves for Jehovah and his Theocracy. If you have taken your stand on the side of God and his kingdom, see to it that you are continuously loyal and faithful to The Theocracy, walk in the way of the Lord, and continue to pray unto God through Christ Jesus. An appropriate prayer the Lord has put before all who have agreed to do his will, in these words: “Consider mine enemies; for they are many: and they hate me with cruel hatred. 0 keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.”—Ps. 25:19-21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> There is but one way to heal the people of the nations which are now desirous of being healed, and that is the way which Jehovah God has provided. Christ Jesus is at the temple of God, and his “holy city”, Zion, is builded up, and out from the holy city begins to flow the water of life, that all who will may partake thereof and live. (Rev. 22:17) The remnant were first permitted to see and appreciate the water of life coming from the throne of God, after the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple. Now the “other sheep” have the privilege of seeing and partaking of the blessings thus provided. Concerning this it is written : “And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, in the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.” (Rev. 22:1,2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)—</span><span class="font5">See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font5"> Book Two, page 254; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font5"> Book Three, page 303.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>61</sup> Christ Jesus, with his own precious lifeblood, has bought the human race, and those who believe in God and Christ and devote themselves to the Lord and obey his rules shall have the benefit of the means God has provided to give them life through Christ Jesus. There is no other means of salvation. (Acts 4:12) Demonism, religion, and human philosophy are altogether in vain. Jehovah God is the “fountain of life”, and he ministers life by and through Jesus Christ, and administers that life and attending blessings to those who faithfully obey and serve him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ASSEMBLY FOR WORSHIP</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font3">LL Christians worship </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah God</span><span class="font3"> in spirit and in truth. All such love Jehovah and Christ his King and love those who truly worship Jehovah and the King. It is a joy to such and a source of great spiritual strength to assemble together to worship the Lord, and it is certain that such is pleasing to the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The evidence is certain that Jehovah is guiding his devoted people at the present time and that he is leading them to one place that they may there assemble and worship Almighty God as he has commanded. For the year 1941 it appears to be pleasing to Jehovah to have his people assemble at St. Louis, August 6-10 inclusive. The place of assembly will be at The Arena, 5700 Oakland Avenue, where space is provided for the assembly and accommodation of approximately 75,000 persons. If a greater number than that attend additional space can be readily provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just why Jehovah is leading his covenant people to the Missouri city it is not necessary now for us to know. In his due time he will make that clearly to appear. It is sufficient now to know that the spirit of God leads his people there. All who love righteousness and hate wickedness, and who strive to do right, will be welcome. That means all persons who are of good-will toward the great </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocrat</span><span class="font3"> will be welcome, and it is hoped that as many as possible will attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Throughout the entire earth the people now mourn and many are seeking that which would bring them comfort. Jehovah has commissioned his people to “comfort all that mourn”. All who are fully devoted to Jehovah will be diligent to fulfill that divinely given commission. As the consecrated journey to and from the convention, and while there, each one should be diligent to render comfort to those who have a hearing ear, desiring to know of God’s gracious provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At other times many cities have been tied together with land wires and by radio and all have participated in one convention though gathered together at many different points. This year it appears to be Jehovah’s will that all who can do so shall personally attend at one point. That fact calls to mind the Scriptures concerning “the general assembly ... of the firstborn”, which assembly may be quite near. For many who attend there will be some inconveniences and some hardships, no doubt, but all such will remember the words of the apostle recorded at Acts 14:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The joys and attending blessings will far outweigh all inconveniences. The Almighty God and His King will make all necessary provision for the protection and blessing of those who are devoted to </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy.</span><span class="font3"> Let all such now turn their hearts and faces toward the convention of August 6-10 and keep before the Lord in prayer and supplication that coming assembly, that Jehovah may there pour out a great blessing upon all who love and serve Him that these may have a part in the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>&quot;HIS CHARIOT”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Who </span><span class="font3">maketh the clouds his chariot.” “The char-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thou’ ” sands upon thousands: the Lord is among them.” (Psalm 104: 3 and 68:17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> Chariots are symbols of war, and the mention of them in prophecy suggests that the day of God’s wrath and the execution of his judgment against the enemy has come. That in the Scriptures chariots are used to symbolize war equipment, and the preparation for war as well as war itself, note Isaiah 66:15,16: “For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh; and the slain of the Lord shall be many.” This text and others prove that the fight at the universal war of Armageddon will not be merely a symbolic affair, because Jehovah God announces his purpose to clean Satan’s organization off the earth. Let those who would put on the soft pedal concerning that wicked organization of the Devil, visible and invisible, beware. The invisible army of the Lord God is marching on to victory. Jehovah marches to war with his “thousands upon thousands” of chariots of war. Knowing in advance that this victory is certain is a source of great courage and strength to all who love righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hundreds of years before Christ the prophet Zechariah was given a vision of the militant organization of Jehovah. The prophet looked again, and tells what he saw: “And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.” (Zech. 6:1) “Chariots” here are symbols of Jehovah’s great war organization, and there being four chariots means that God’s organization is a four-square one, fully equipped to push the enemy from every point and to completely defeat and destroy him. The fact that these chariots come out from between two mountains of brass symbolically says that they are exceedingly strong. “And the mountains were mountains of copper.” (Leeser’s trans.) Gold, silver and copper are classed as “noble” metals, and hence their coming out from between mountains of copper or brass shows they are beyond the earthly quality, therefore superhuman, and are sent by Jehovah God and hence are in no way a part of Satan’s visible, earthly government. .These chariots picture the fighting organization of Jehovah God under the leadership of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ancient Israelites misused and abused Jehovah’s, temple at Jerusalem, and Jehovah therefore caused the prophet Ezekiel to prophesy of the destruction of Jerusalem. “Christendom,” or “organized Christianity”, and which is the nominal spiritual Israel, has misused and abused God’s true spiritual temple, and God’s judgment of destruction against it is recorded in the Scriptures and is now being pronounced by &quot;his witnesses on earth. The first chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy is a description of Jehovah’s organization as it appeared under symbols to the prophet. This vision of Ezekiel shows the Lord God Almighty sitting upon his throne over and above all the forces of his organization and coming “out of the north” and moving forward to the destruction of the unfaithful city Jerusalem, picturing “Christendom” of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God has a universal organization. He has always had an organization, and from time immemorial his only begotten Son, The Logos or Word of God, was the chief officer of Jehovah’s organization. Because of the rebellion of Satan and the resulting fall of man, Jehovah God made the Logos a man upon earth. At the time of Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan, there began God’s “new creation”, which He will use in the vindication of His name and in dealing with mankind, “reconciling the world unto himself.” Jesus Christ was put to the test, and proved faithful and true, and was exalted to the highest place in heaven next to Jehovah God himself and was made the Head of God’s capital organization, Zion, for ever. And this was in fulfillment of prophecy.—Ps. 110:1-4; Heb. 7:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the Israelites of old Jehovah God organized typical Zion, which was prophetic of the real Zion to come. He then organized the real Zion, with Christ Jesus as Head, and which is therefore God’s organization real. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus, finally 144,000 in number, are built up in Zion and made a part thereof. (Rev. 7: 4-8; and 14:1-3) The exalted Lord Jesus, as God’s executive officer, prepares a place for his faithful followers in. that capital organization.—John 14:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet Ezekiel, when sent to prophesy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, was caused to write down his vision of God’s organization, as depicted on the front-cover page of this magazine, which please see. (Ezek. 1:4-28) He writes: “And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.” In that vision there now appeared four living creatures, every one of which had four faces and four wings. Ezekiel writes: “Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and they four had their faces and their wings. Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.”—Vss. 4-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many centuries later the apostle John in exile had a like vision of four living creatures attending upon the Lord at his temple. John writes of his vision: “And before the throne [there was] as it were a sea of glass like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. And the first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.” (Rev. 4: 6-8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> Christ Jesus is “in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures”. (Rev. 5: 6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> He is the first of God’s organization, and all other creatures therein operate around his throne. The four living creatures, or living ones, therefore represent the foursquareness or completeness of God’s organization. These are “full of eyes before and behind”, showing that those of God’s organization are ever on the alert beholding His hand that they may do his will as he indicates, and hence are guided by divine wisdom.—Ps. 123:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">John’s description of the four living creatures, that is, of God’s organization, follows, and the first one is “like a lion”, denoting courage and royal justice. (Ps. 89:14; Ps 9:4) Justice holds the place of first importance. The second living creature resembled an ox or “steer”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott </span><span class="font3">trans.) In the prophetic temple built by King Solomon the copper laver or “molten sea” rested upon twelve oxen. The ox denotes power and strength, and the symbol seems to say: Almighty power and strength supports the divine organization, and God will accomplish his purposes by and through his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The third living one or creature had the face of a man, which depicts love as the motive. “God is love”; and man is described as being made in the image of God. The man Christ Jesus said: “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,” because he is perfect in love. Every action in God’s organization is prompted by love. Nothing else could be in harmony with him or pleasing to him. It therefore shows that those who are privileged to have any part in his organization must be prompted wholly by unselfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fourth living creature was “like a flying eagle”; which depicts far-sightedness, exalted wisdom and swiftness in action: “Swifter than the eagles of the heaven.” (Lam. 4:19) “Fly away, as an eagle toward heaven.” (Prov. 23:5) “Wisdom is too high for a fool.” (Prov. 24: 7) The eagle flies high, and wisdom is never dimmed by age. “Thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.” (Ps. 103: 5) Every part of God’s organization is swift to obey his commandments, and they are guided by divine wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The four living creatures John saw had each six wings. The three pairs of wings had by each would suggest that the possessor can fly and provide protection at the same time, therefore that the creatures of God’s organization move swiftly without hindrance in the performance of Jehovah’s purposes and at the same time full protection is provided for those members of his organization that are on the earth. Their protection, of course, is provided by invisible members of the organization. These creatures never rest, showing that the organization of Jehovah is always alert and on the move. Nor do those of the organization keep silence lest they should disturb the peace of some of Satan’s organization. (Isa. 62: 6, 7) Continuously they sing praises to the name of the eternal King, saying: “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The four creatures that the prophet Ezekiel saw had each the four faces of the four living creatures seen by the apostle John: “Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps; it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.” (Vss. 11-13) “And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings.” (Chapter 10, verse 8) The form of a man’s hand under the wings of these living creatures seems to say that God has used the hand of human creatures to bear the coals of God’s message of fiery indignation which the Lord will use against the enemy organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By each of the living creatures which had four faces there appeared in the vision also one wheel upon the earth, all four wheels being of one likeness and being related to one another like the wheels of a four-wheeled chariot. “And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. Now, as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl; and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. When they went, they went upon their four sides; and they turned not when they went. As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.”—Ezek. 1:14-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus there appeared over the heads of the living creatures a great expanse like terrible crystal to look upon. Under the expanse were the wings of the living creatures, each having four wings, two on each side of the body. When these creatures went, the sound of the wings was like the sound of many waters. “And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings. And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.” (Vss. 24, 25) Thus the Lord calls attention to his coming in the most impressive manner, causing his message to be given a far-sounding proclamation. The world sees not his coming; but his faithful witnesses discern it and are caused to give proper announcement thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then the prophet beheld in the vision a firmament, and above the firmament and above everything animate and inanimate there appeared the likeness of a throne upon which a glorious person sat enshrined in perfect light: “And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.”—Vss. 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus above the expanse or firmament was the likeness of a great throne having the appearance of a sapphire stone, and upon the throne was one having the appearance of a man. There was the appearance of fire round about and within it, and the color was of amber. After describing the appearance of the one on the throne, then the prophecy adds: “As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.” (Vs. 28) Ezekiel was there given a vision of Jehovah’s mighty organization and he fell upon his face. The vision pictured Jehovah’s superiority over his organization. God’s faithful remnant of witnesses on earth, whom Ezekiel foreshadowed, now must recognize Jehovah’s great organization and show proper veneration for it. They must worship and be fully obedient to “The Higher Powers”, to wit, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.—Rom. 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus it is seen that the prophetic description is one fitly representing a mighty war chariot The number “four” appears prominently therein and is a divine number representing completeness. The vision, therefore, speaks prophetically of something complete, and is a prophecy to have a fulfillment in due time. The living creatures and the inanimate objects, or instruments, appearing in the vision, together give the appearance of an enormous living chariotlike organization extending high into the heavens, and over all of which Jehovah God presides. In that organization, and appearing next to Jehovah, is his great High Priest and Executive Officer, Christ Jesus. With him in heaven, and forming a part of the great living organization, are those faithful followers of Christ Jesus, including the apostles, who died and for whom the Lord prepared a place in God’s organization, and who had their resurrection to life in the spirit and were put in their places when the Lord Jesus came to his temple in 1918 for the judgment of his followers and the nations. Such resurrected ones are part of “the body of Christ”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In that organization are also seraphim. There appear in the organization cherubim, who are executive officers of Jehovah and therefore members of the organization. Then appear legions of pure and mighty angels who have their places in the organization and perform their respective duties. Down on the earth are the anointed remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, who constitute the “feet of Him”, which means the last members of the “body of Christ” on earth and for whom the Lord has prepared a place to stand and walk about in God’s organization; and these do what the Lord has for them to do, and they are a part of his organization. Now also a multitude of persons of good-will, who shall form the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors, become companions of the remnant in the Lord’s witness work, and thus become associated with God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The entire organization, represented by the symbols in the vision, revolves within a circle of divine wisdom, represented by “eyes”, and is directed by the perfect wisdom that is from heaven above. The vision, therefore, speaks prophetically of God’s perfect and mighty organization. The prophet says that in the vision “out of the fire went forth lightning”. That must mean that Jehovah sends forth his truth through his organization, and that the “lightning” represents the illumination of that truth which comes from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vision is a prophecy now in course of fulfillment, because that Theocratic organization is functioning since Jehovah by his representative Christ Jesus came to his temple. Furthermore, the coming of the Lord to his temple indicates that the time of hostilities for the destruction of Satan’s organization in heaven and earth has arrived, by reason of the fact that Jehovah is accompanied by his living creatures of his great organization and it moves in a great chariot-like formation prepared for and advancing for war, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font3">BOUT two hundred and fifty years after man went wrong a grandson of Adam, named Enos, was born. By that time, as far as the Scriptures disclose, every man on earth was following the course of wickedness. This, of course, warrants the conclusion that all the human race was by that time under the control of man’s enemy, the Devil. This one must have thought that he had succeeded in having all men worship him and that he had turned them all away from their Creator; and therefore he set about to mock God by establishing a system of hypocrisy. It was in the days of Enos that hypocrisy began to manifest itself for the first time, and then in connection with a form of worship called religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Record it is written, at Genesis 4:26, marginal reading: “And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call themselves by the name of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font3"> [Jehovah].” Why should they desire to call themselves by the name of the Lord if they were wicked? The answer is, that such was a scheme of the great slanderer, or the Devil, to have the people pretend to be sons of God and yet to pursue a course in exact opposition to God, and thereby to ridicule and reproach God and hold his name up to scorn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This ancient occurrence discloses a scheme of Satan the Devil which he has practiced ever since, namely, to have as a part of his visible organization amongst men some kind of organized system of religion, such as “Christendom”, by which he could bring ridicule and reproach upon the name of Jehovah. Furthermore, Satan knew that man was so constituted that he would need to worship someone higher than himself. Satan, of course, wished to keep man always under his control and have man to worship him; but should he not be able to keep man completely under his control and have his worship, then he would establish amongst men hypocrisy, and thus, while they would pretend to worship their Creator, they would be unfaithful to God. This practice of hypocrisy, or religion, would be a reproach upon the name of Jehovah and a ridicule of God. Later a few men did turn to the worship of the true God, but it is observed that throughout the ages the major portion of men’s worship has been religion, which is in reality demonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After Abel the first man mentioned with favor in the Scriptures was Enoch. He was of the seventh generation from Adam. (See Jude 14.) Enoch is held forth in great contrast to Enos and other men of his time. Aside from Abel every man from Adam down to the birth of Enoch was undoubtedly evil. The human race was going the road of corruption. Enoch was the exception. He believed in Jehovah God. He believed that some day God would reward all those who would obey Him. So active had Satan the Devil been that the people of earth by that time even doubted the existence of Jehovah God. It was necessary for Enoch to exercise faith that God actually exists. This was necessary in order for him to please God. As written at Hebrews 11:6: “Without faith it is impossible to please God; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” That Enoch pleased God is shown by the following record, at Genesis 5:24: “And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.” To the same effect Hebrews</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">11:5 testifies: “By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Enoch was a witness on the earth for Jehovah God. Surely he was known amongst the other men and known by the fact that he believed on God and served him, while all others were against Jehovah. Such faith under such adverse conditions was pleasing to God, and God rewarded that faith by translating Enoch. In those days it was usual for men to live for seven or eight centuries. Enoch lived only three hundred and sixty-five years, and then God took him away. No one saw him go, no one buried him, and no one knew where he went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan the Devil had the power of death, and without doubt he would have killed Enoch had not God prevented him from so doing. Of course, God has the power of death, but he did not put Enoch to death for any wrongful act on Enoch’s part. Nor did Enoch die because of sickness, the result of the inheritance from Adam, his grandfather The Devil had nothing to do with putting Enoch to death. Enoch was a young man compared with his father Jared, who lived 800 years after he begot Enoch. While in the vigor of youth and while he walked with God and joyfully conformed himself to God’s righteous law, the Lord manifested his pleasure in the faith of Enoch by taking him away, by putting him to sleep without his having to pass through the bitter waters of a lingering or agonizing death</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems reasonable that Enoch never saw anyone die, because the inspired apostle Paul testifies that Enoch did “not see death”. This same apostle, after enumerating a number of faithful men of old, including Enoch, states: “These all died in faith.” (Hebrews 11:5-13) It follows, of course, that Enoch was not taken away to live on some other planet, but that God took him by quietly and suddenly putting him to sleep without pain or anguish and without fear of the terrible monster death. Here God began to indicate that at some time he would destroy death and deliver all those who have faith in him from all their enemies, including the enemy death.—1 Cor. 15: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jude 14,15 records that Enoch prophesied that in some future time the Lord would come with a mighty host of holy ones and execute judgment upon the ungodly. Of course, he would give utterance to this prophecy in the presence of other men, and they would mock and jeer and taunt him, and then the Devil would use every power at his command to destroy Enoch. But Jehovah God held his hand over Enoch. It is evident that God had told Enoch, or by some means had put it into Enoch’s mind, that sometime in the future he would send His mighty representative, Christ Jesus, to execute judgment upon all the enemies of Jehovah God and deliver the people of good-will from bondage. The spirit of the Lord moved upon Enoch’s mind and caused him to prophesy, because his heart was right toward God. Enoch’s was the first prophecy by man of a coming Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus, by these two men, Enos and Enoch, are made manifest religion, a detestable and hypocritical thing in the sight of Jehovah God, and the opposite, true faith, which is pleasing to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERING IN EGYPT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I was giving explanation of the Bible to about ten listeners, Italians, Mohammedans and Copts. Suddenly a Coptic priest came, the people giving him honor, a seat, and kissing his hands and offering him cigarettes. He asked what I was doing there. I started to give him the message. Astonished, he confidentially whispered: 'Where did you study such things ?’ I then said loudly before all listeners: ‘If you will also study such things, you have to take off your robe and follow Christ and his teachings.’ Mortified, he asked the grocer for his Bible so that I could prove to him the passages concerning the clerics. I asked him to read Matthew 23. Not knowing its contents, the clergyman took a grand position, pulled up his wide sleeves and started loudly to read in front of all listeners the passages thereof, while all were laughing at seeing him swallowing hard his spittle and uttering the words identifying himself in the passages he was reading; so he said: ‘Enough, please.’ At this I greeted them friendlily and left. For a week-end I had opportunity to go to Minia, Upper Egypt, and took some literature with me. In four days I distributed about 27 books and 81 booklets, and this very easily. Sunday I decided to distribute literature in the St. Tadros Coptic church. I sat beside a well-dressed lady, asking when the service would end. I asked what does the priest explain. She said she did not really understand. I then said I had books which translate the Scriptures properly, and attracted all her attention. She took eight booklets on a contribution. The collection of the church came along, one following the other, and the fourth was at the end a demonstration of beggars. I saw through a window there was a room attached to the auditorium of the church, in which a priest was sitting, the collectors giving him their collection. I rushed to this room, asking the priest to permit me to distribute some booklets on the Bible. He agreed, called me inside the church, set a desk for me, boys took my bag and spread its contents over the desk, I gave a little witness, and in about ten minutes all my literature was distributed in the very heart of this church. I gave a booklet as well to the priest, thanked him and went out. Next day I had to leave Minia by 5 a.m. tram for Port Said, nine hours of continuous travel on express. In the train was a crowd of British soldiers coming from service for the week-end. I gave them the message, unfortunately having no books with me except a few </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> They took them happily. At Port Said I went to pay a visit to the sub-commandant and the commandant of the police, both British. We have long known each other. Though German-born I never cared about my own people, as I experienced from them the worst behavior a human could experience. I took with me the gramophone with the entire speech of Judge Rutherford, ‘Government and Peace.’ The commandant objected, but, after seeing the sub-commandant insisted, he consented, and they with their families listened to the whole speech and appointed me to come and get the gramophone two days later. Three days after, I called at their office, and they asked me to leave it another day for some others to listen to the speech in their houses. I asked the sub-commandant kindly to note the listeners in order to report to you the number of attendance.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERS CARRY ON BY BACK-CALLS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Working in this district for some time prior to the outlawing of our organization, we had met a number of people of good-will and at that time were carrying on back-calls and model studies. We kept in touch with every one that showed the slightest interest, realizing that ‘this gospel of the kingdom must continue to be preached’. From personal experience, we cannot say too much in favor of obeying instructions published in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> One point that helped us very much was to remember that ‘every call was a prospective back-call, every back-call a prospective model study, every person attending the model study a prospective publisher’. Indeed it has worked out that way in this district. There has been an increase of twenty-five active publishers, the direct result of back-calls and model studies; while others just coming in are showing evidence of desiring to have a part in the work. Some who have been identified with the organization for some time and who were rather reluctant to have a part in the work ‘while the dew was on the ground’, were encouraged when they saw the zeal of the new publishers, and have put forth greater efforts in the service. It naturally follows that we have had the Lord’s blessing in this district; the fellowship enjoyed by all is a joy to our hearts in spite of the element of danger we feel every time we go forth to ‘sow seed’. Again we say with heartfelt thanks to Jehovah for his goodness, ‘Obey instructions for results.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER BEFORE A TEXAS GRAND JURY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A man acted very rudely, cursing, tried to push me off the porch, threw my book satchel into the yard and scattered my books. We went to the police. They sent us to the district attorney. One of his assistants filed the case, which was stopped immediately. We then followed instructions from the Lord’s organization, made out affidavits stating what had happened and mailed them to the proper authorities. I received a letter from the district attorney asking me to come to see him. When I asked why the filing of the case had been stopped he said they handled cases different ways and he preferred to let me appear as a witness before the grand jury and state the case to them. January 17 the grand jury was in session. I appeared. The foreman asked me to tell just what happened. I gave name, address and identification card and said I was consecrated to do God’s will and obey his commandments as stated in Isaiah 61:1, 2. I started to quote, and the foreman said: ‘We don’t want any preaching now.’ I said: ‘I’m not preaching. It is necessary to cite the scriptures to show why I was doing this work so you may understand the case better.’ He said, ‘Go on!’ So I did, quoting Matthew 24:14 and other scriptures. Then I stated what happened. The foreman said, ‘Just show us exactly what happened.’ So I opened the phonograph and demonstrated the doorstep method. After I finished, the foreman said, Let’s hear what the record says.’ After the record finished there was an entirely different attitude. The others asked questions, and I showed the literature and explained about the coming of the Kingdom, witnessing for the name of Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus. I left them twelve copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and some copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font3"> It was wonderful to get to witness before a grand jury, and especially to play the phonograph.”</span></p>
