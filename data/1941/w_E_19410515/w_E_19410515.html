<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth&quot; with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>NOAH’S DAY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.&quot;—Gen. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">JEHOVAH has set Noah before men as an example I for those to follow who have faith in God and in </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font6"> his kingdom and who would be faithful. When God puts his approval on a man, others who come afterwards do well to give consideration as to why God marks that man with approval. God never changes, and when he approves one man we may be sure that his approval will be placed upon other men who likewise do well before him. God is no respecter of persons. What is required of one to merit God’s approval he likewise requires of all others who receive his approval.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The Scriptures disclose the reason why God approved Noah. He was just, was blameless in his conduct, maintained his integrity, was a man of faith, and was faithful under the test. It is written: “Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.” (Gen. 6: 9) The word “perfect” used in the foregoing text is defined by the best Biblical authorities as “blameless, sound, sincere, undefiled and upright, one of integrity and a bearer of the truth”. Noah was a man of faith, and he was faithfully obedient to God. He ascertained God’s commandment and rendered himself in obedience thereto. It follows, therefore, that every other who may expect and hope to receive God’s approval must be just, sincere, pure in thought and action, a bearer of the truth, and one who maintains his integrity toward God. He must have faith in God and be faithfully obedient to the will or commandment of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> The scripture further emphasizes the necessity for and the importance of faith and why this record of Noah was made. “But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”—Heb. 11: 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">‘ Furthermore the Scriptures speak of Noah as “a preacher of righteousness” at a time when the earth was filled with violence. Undoubtedly Noah maintained his integrity toward God under great adversity and shunned not to declare the truth under all circumstances, which truth he received from God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Says the scripture: “Noah was . . . perfect in his generations.” That means that he had employed his organism in the right way. His God-given equipment he used in a right way. He had in no wise defiled himself with other creatures. He was blameless before the Lord. His children were conceived and brought forth without fault on his part. Being an offspring of Adam, he was by nature under condemnation, and that was not the fault of Noah. His children were born in the proper manner, and aside from Noah there were no others on the earth perfect in generation as he was, but all others aside from him and his family were defiled. Noah stood out in contrast to all others on the earth. God was pleased with him. He is therefore a proper example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Noah was a type of Christ Jesus and was used by Jehovah to make a prophetic drama foretelling the Lord Jesus and some of his work. Because the members of his family held steadfastly with Noah to the course of righteousness they were used by the Lord God to foretell the Lord’s “other sheep”, or Jonadabs, who will form the “great multitude”. (Rev. 7:9-17) Noah busied himself with preaching the name of Jehovah God, and no doubt the members of his family worked with him, and hence they were, in fact, companions to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> Jesus says: “As it was in the days of No'e, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” (Luke 17: 26) These words not only are a confirmation of the record written long before concerning Noah, the ark and the flood, but show that Noah’s testimony and his work were so important in the carrying out of Jehovah’s purposes that God used him to foretell what must come to pass at the time of setting up of the kingdom under Christ Jesus, the King. The ark, which Noah builded at the command of Jehovah, pictured the organization builded by the Most High by and through Christ Jesus, and which is God’s capital organization, with Christ Jesus as the Head thereof. The saving and carrying over the flood of the eight persons pictured the survivors of Armageddon that the Lord will carry over to the new and righteous world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BLIND INDIFFERENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> The people that were on earth in Noah’s day heard the sound of Noah’s voice warning of the coming flood, but they gave no heed to that warning. They knew Noah was building the ark, or great boat,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">which was a testimony of Noah’s faith in God, but the people who saw it regarded it as of no importance and as evidence of Noah’s “weakness of mind”. No doubt they often derided Noah and made much sport of him. What the people really did was to satisfy and glorify their own desires; as the apostle puts it, they made their belly their god and ignored everything that tends to righteousness: “They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.” (Luke 17: 27) “For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into the ark, and knew not, until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”—Matt. 24: 38, 39.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> It thus appears from these scriptures that the people were entirely indifferent to what Noah told them about the approaching disaster. They indulged in eating, drinking and marrying, and everything that would satisfy their beastly desires. Eating, drinking and marrying in the proper way are according to God’s provision for man; but manifestly the conduct of the people in Noah’s time, and which is mentioned in the Genesis account as in using these things in an improper way, is called to attention in the Scriptures to show that they were using proper things in a wrongful manner. Since Jesus says that which existed in Noah’s day constitutes a type of what comes to pass in the day when Christ Jesus comes to set up his kingdom, it is certain that the Bible account of the prevailing state of affairs in Noah’s day, which is set forth in the sixth chapter of Genesis, was typical and foretells the prevailing state of affairs or like conditions on earth at and during the time of the setting up of the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STATE OF AFFAIRS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> The state of affairs that existed in Noah’s day included more than marrying, giving in marriage, eating and drinking. Manifestly these were mentioned specifically by Jesus and the faithful servants of the Lord to further compare what did exist in Noah’s day with what exists at the present time. The state of affairs in Noah’s day summed up in brief, as set forth in the Scriptures, was this: Satan, chief of demons, was desperately working to make good his wicked challenge that no man would be faithful to God when put to the test. Satan’s endeavor was to turn all men against Jehovah. Associated with </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font6">were then and still are a company of demons, called “Nephilim”, bullies or tyrants, all bent on defeating God and turning all creation against God. (Gen. 6: 4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> The acts and conduct of those demons and those connected with them foretold a like condition or state of affairs on earth at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. In Noah’s day there were angels, called “sons of God”, which had power to materialize in human form. The sly, subtle, wily foe Satan tricked those angels into marrying the offspring of Adam, with the result that there were brought forth on the earth human creatures who were given over entirely to wickedness: “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.”—Gen. 6: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> Since Satan’s rebellion all who follow him in that rebellion are wicked and have been and are blind as to Jehovah’s purposes. Being wicked, they have no faith and hence cannot understand or appreciate the goodness of God. Those wicked ones opposed God in all things. It is written concerning Satan that he, as the invisible ruler of the -wicked world, blinds others to God’s purposes. “In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”—2 Cor. 4: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> It follows, then, that all who give themselves over to the demons are mentally and morally and spiritually blind. Satan has continued in that course of wickedness even till now because he is totally depraved. The religious leaders amongst the Jews were denounced by Jesus as “blind guides” for the reason that they had forgotten God and yielded to the power and influence of the demons. Not only were they blind themselves, but they led the people into blindness. In Noah’s day blindness as to God’s purpose was a part of the state of affairs, foretelling a like state at the time of the presence of the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VIOLENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> Another prevailing state of affairs was that of violence. Undoubtedly all manner of debauchery and violence were indulged in and none had any regard for the rights and privileges of others, but all were bent on doing mischief. That state of affairs existed immediately preceding the time of the flood. “And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.”—Gen. 6:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> The Nephilim, bullies or tyrants, and their associates in violence, such as wicked men, doubtless would have killed Noah and his family had not Almighty God prevented them from so doing. God preserved Noah and his family for his own purpose and for his own name’s sake.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> Sexual immorality must have been terrible in Noah’s day, and that was a part of the state of affairs existing. The people, under the influence and power of the demons, were given over to looseness, lewd and lascivious conduct. They indulged in all manner of debauchery, the result of which was to turn all men’s thoughts from Almighty God: ‘And every imagination of the thoughts of their heart was evil continually.’—Gen. 6: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> All of such was an abomination in the sight of God: “And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.”—Gen. 6:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>17</sup> The only exception to the terrible debauchery and wicked state of affairs that prevailed upon earth then was Noah and the members of his family. Because of their faith and obedience they found grace or favor in the eyes of the Lord and were saved by him. Thus they pictured a class of people who find grace in the eyes of the Lord in this day and who are saved from the deluge of fire at Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY RECORDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Why would Almighty God cause a record to be made and kept of such wickedness as that described in the Genesis account? The Scriptures answer that the same was recorded as a warning foretelling what shall come to pass at the end of the world. (1 Cor. 10:11; Rom. 15:4) There could be no occasion or necessity to give such warning unless a like and terrible state of affairs was anticipated to come to the earth at a later time. That warning is further given for the express benefit of persons now on the earth that they, being warned, may escape the pitfall set by the demons and find a place of safety under the direction of the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS DAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> The present time is “his day”, that is, the day of the Son of man, Christ Jesus the Lord and King. When on earth Jesus gave warning that a state of affairs like that which existed in Noah’s day would exist and persist in the day of the coming of the Lord and the setting up of his kingdom. It is true that the peoples of the earth today ‘eat, drink, marry<sup>5 </sup>and seek personal selfish gratification, and show indifference to the message of the Kingdom, and will continue to do so until Armageddon sweeps them away. To the warning they give no heed. They are blind to Jehovah’s purpose, and they continue in that way until the wrath of God is expressed at Armageddon. And why are they blind and understand not and have no interest in the Kingdom? Because of the seductive influence of Satan and his associate demons. There has been a world-wide witness to the name and kingdom of God during the past twenty-five years, and the net result is that only a small number of persons have heard and given heed to that warning and some have fled and more are fleeing to the Lord. All the others are blind and continue in blindness. The blindness and indifference to God’s message today are similar to what prevailed in Noah’s day. Are such things all that are similar or alike of the two periods of time? No, there are others. In Noah’s day there were bullies browbeating and overrunning the people of the world. Also there prevailed in Noah’s time a state of lawlessness or moral wickedness resulting in debauchery of all human creatures aside from Noah and his family. In all the nations of earth today there prevails a state of affairs of violence similar to that of Noah’s day. All of this is the result of the influence of the demons under the leadership of Satan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> That Satan and his associate host of demons continued to operate after the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, and still operate at the present time, there cannot be the slightest doubt. Those same demons performed their wicked deeds amongst the people when Jesus was in the flesh. The blind religionists carried out the orders of Satan, they also being entirely blind to God’s purpose. To the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, who are looking to and are in the way for the Kingdom, these words of admonition are addressed: “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” (Eph. 6:10-12) This is proof that in the present time the demons are operating.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> What is the purpose of the conflict between the demons and the Lord’s devoted people ? On the part of Satan the purpose is to carry out his original challenge to Jehovah and to bring about the destruction of all those who have made a covenant to do the will of God. As to Jehovah and his purpose, He permits the Devil and his associate demons to beset His covenant people in order to give Satan full opportunity to carry out his wicked challenge and at the same time to afford an opportunity for those who have made a covenant with God to obey Him and maintain their integrity toward him. It is the time of crucial testing. The same rules of the Lord apply to those who are Jonadabs and who have hope to be of the “great multitude” as apply to others who have made a covenant to do the Lord’s will. Let this be kept in mind: that the demons now direct their wicked action chiefly against God’s covenant people, both of the “remnant” and of the Jonadabs, because the demons have control over all the others of this wicked world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> The prevailing state of affairs in the nations of earth today is such that the rights of the people are ignored and the bullies, visible and invisible, browbeat, oppress and rule the people in a harsh and cruel way. There is no righteous rule, and for that reason the people mourn. Religious and political dictators and commercial giants together destroy the liberties of the people. Wickedness prevails, and the wicked are in control. “The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.” (Ps. 10:4) This prevailing state of affairs is the result of the influence and power of the demons.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VIOLENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> As it was in Noah’s day so it is at the present time, where now ‘the earth is filled with violence’. In every nation violence is directed especially against those who are in a covenant to do the will of God and who are diligent to keep faithfully that covenant. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus are violently ‘hated for his name’s sake’, even as Jesus foretold. (Matt. 24:9) During the year last past violence against Jehovah’s witnesses has been shown particularly throughout that part of the earth known as “Christendom”. Mobs, led by religious preachers, have wickedly and violently assaulted and beaten and otherwise ill-used the true followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> Political officers, sworn to uphold the law and order of the land, acting together with the religious preachers, wholly disregard all law and rules of righteousness and indulge in violent assaults upon the followers of Christ Jesus, treat them cruelly and imprison them. It is certain that all of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions today would be slain by the violent ones were it not for the protection the Lord provides for them. The rights of the people and the freedom which at one time they enjoyed are no longer given consideration by many of the ruling element. For instance, when Christian citizens appeared before the legislative committee of the State of Connecticut in March, 1941, to express opposition to the Bill pending before that legislature, which, if enacted into law, would destroy the Constitutional rights of citizens to preach the truth, members of the legislative committee brazenly and violently replied to such protest: “We are not interested in your Constitutional rights.” Thus men elected by the people to safeguard the people’s interests have no interest in the rights of the people. Religion, politics, commerce, and their agencies have united in their efforts to heap violence upon all those who boldly declare the name of and the kingdom of Jehovah. Freedom of worship of Almighty God has disappeared from the earth, and only Jehovah and his King give protection to those who love righteousness. Violence is bad enough, but there is a more subtle way in which the demons now attempt to wreck the world and to destroy those who have made a covenant to do the will of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MORAL DELINQUENCY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> “Seduction” is the act of leading aside or astray from the path of rectitude, virtue and duty, and into paths of evil, to corrupt men. “Debauchery. means to degrade and corrupt, and is usually the result of seduction. In Noah’s day and up to the time of the flood Satan and his associate demons seduced angels and human creatures, leading them away from the path of duty, rectitude and virtue and into the paths of degradation. The “sons of God” of the angelic order materialized and by the demons were induced to take human women for wives and therefore to take a course contrary to God’s fixed law. These indulged sexually with women, and the result was that both were debauched and the offspring of that action were morally delinquent to the extreme; as it is written: “For all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.” (Gen. 6:12) There was a clear line of demarcation or distinction between “all flesh . . . upon the earth” and the eight persons of Noah’s family, these being the exception. That was in Noah’s day, and, says Jesus, “so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>26</sup> The present is the day of the Son of man. And what are the facts as related to the prophecy uttered by Jesus as above? In 1914 Christ Jesus was enthroned and sent forth to rule, while the wicked ones still operated. The “war in heaven” followed, and the demons were defeated and cast down to earth. (Rev. 12:1-12) From 1914 onward the moral standard upon earth has continued to be lowered. Religion has become more outwardly degrading. In the name of the Lord the people are invited to religious meetings, there to indulge in bingo games and other gambling games and in other practices that are far from righteous. Religion is used as a shield to carry on many other immoral and wicked schemes. Politics has moved to a far lower standard. Commerce and commercial operations have lowered their standard and become more cruel and heartless. Morality has greatly lowered its standard in regard to the relationship between the sexes. Less than half a century ago few women indulged in intoxicating drinks to excess, and few, if any, indulged at all in the use of tobacco. Today almost all women indulge in both to great excess and their moral and mental state and standard are greatly lowered. The relationship between the sexes has become deplorable. Both the rulers and the ruled find themselves today on the toboggan slide hurrying madly on their downward way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> Why this marked change for the worse since 1914? The Lord gives the answer, which now sounds the warning: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”—Rev. 12:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Like the torrential waters of the swollen Jordan river, the population of the world is madly and heedlessly rushing downward to the antitypical sea of death. And that is not all. Against whom in particular is the seductive campaign of the demons directed? All who are of the world and who hold onto the world are already under the wicked one. (1 John 5:19) Against whom, then, is the assault now being made particularly? The subtle and seductive shafts of the demons are now specifically directed against the covenant people of God. The demons in their wicked activities endeavor to cause God’s covenant people to violate their covenant and to join the world in destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>29</sup> Subtly the demons endeavor to cause the covenant people of God to become careless and to let down the proper bars between the sexes, so that moral and sexual delinquency is the result. Those who are watching the developments of present-day affairs see the evidence of a retrograde movement to moral delinquency. Undue familiarity, at first intended to be innocent and appearing as such, often opens the gate to greater dangers. Seductive methods are at work, and debauchery is certain to result unless those wrongful methods are strongly resisted. The demons set snares, and the careless are led into such snares and, once in them, find it difficult to extricate themselves. Carelessness and loose conduct tighten the snare about them. This is one of the great dangers today to the covenant people of God. The Lord sounds the warning saying: As it was in Noah’s day, so shall it be also in the day of the Son of man.’ The covenant people of God must take warning and give heed to the Lord’s warning if they would safeguard themselves from the assaults of the demons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> Sodom and Gomorrah are also set forth as examples of the state of affairs that would come to pass at the present time : “Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” (Jude 7) “Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.”—Luke 17: 28-30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> What led to the seduction and debauchery of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah by the demons? Pride, idleness, fullness of bread, and sexual abominations : “Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.”—Ezek. 16: 49, 50.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>32</sup> Noah and his family were saved from the assaults of the demons by reason of their faithful obedience to the commandments of Almighty God. Lot and the faithful members of his family likewise were saved from destruction because of their faith and obedience to the Lord’s commandments. God’s rules do not change.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SAFETY NOW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> There is one, and only one, place of safety for God’s covenant people. “The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” (Prov. 18:10) Only those who love Jehovah and his kingdom can remain in that place of safety. To love the Lord means to keep his commandments. For such the following scripture was written: “I will love thee, 0 Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.” (Ps. 18:1-3) “For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.”—Ps. 61: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>34</sup> These are “the last days” and therefore are days of great peril. (2 Tim. 3:1) These are like Noah’s day and even worse. That the warfare today of God’s people is with the demons there cannot be the slightest doubt, because this admonition is given : “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”—Eph. 6:10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>35</sup> The rules laid down in the Scriptures for the benefit of the spiritual class of God's covenant people likewise apply to the Lord’s “other sheep”. God changes not, nor do his rules change. (Mal. 3:6) God is no respecter of persons. (Acts 10: 34) All who live must come under the same rules.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SHUN WHAT?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>36</sup> What shall the people of God shun? Everything that tends to corrupt the mind and body must be shunned and avoided. Uncleanness, fornication, lasciviousness, and suchlike. (2 Cor. 12: 21) The “works of the flesh”, specially enumerated by the apostle at Galatians 5:17-21, must be shunned. The way that is traveled by the peoples of the world who are not in a covenant with God must be shunned by those who are in a covenant with him. The ways of darkness and death must be shunned: “And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God: praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel.”—Eph. 6:17-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>37</sup> Unclean thoughts and meditations must be shunned. (Mark 7:15-22) Idleness and slothfulness lead to disaster. The mind and the hands must be occupied in things that are profitable and works that are righteous in order to avoid the pitfalls set by Satan and his emissaries. Idleness contributed to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The demons see to it that the idle brain is filled with improper thoughts and leads to improper action.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DO WHAT 7</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> What must God’s covenant people do ? The remnant must obey the commandments of God. The “other sheep” of the Lord must do likewise. The “other sheep” find protection within the “city of refuge”, that is to say, under the organization of the Lord, and they must stay within bounds and obey the rules and commandments of the Lord’s organization which he gives. The first great commandment is to love God; as it is written: “Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”—Matt. 22:37-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>39</sup> To show one’s love for God means to be diligent to obey God’s commandment. The “neighbor” of the consecrated is everyone who is in a covenant to do the will of God; and to love one’s neighbor’ means to look out well for the interest of that consecrated person, even as you would for your own interest. The vital interest of both is the Kingdom interest; therefore to love one’s neighbor means to help him to advance the Kingdom interest and hence to do the will of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> Thoughts and actions must be clean, and the body must be kept clean. The rules primarily given to the spiritual company of the Lord’s sheep apply in the present time to his “other sheep”, amongst which rules is the following: “Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”—2 Cor. 7:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> The body of flesh must be kept clean because it is the organism devoted to the service of the Lord. The mind of the creature must be kept clean by filling it with thoughts pertaining to The Theocracy. Everything pertaining to The Theocratic Government is clean, and those who receive the benefits of that government must be in full harmony with the great Theocrat and his King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> As to what is proper thinking, the following admonition applies to both remnant and Jonadabs: “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.”—Phil. 4: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>43</sup> Obeying this rule one must have his mind free from improper, unclean thoughts and his mind filled with thoughts concerning The Theocracy and what he may do to advance the interest thereof. Doing thus he could have no time to indulge in loose, lewd, or improper thoughts or conduct. One whose mind is constantly filled with thoughts concerning the great Theocracy and his own relationship thereto will thus be keeping up the barrier against the demons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>44</sup> If one who has made a covenant to obey God and who has fled to the Lord for refuge becomes careless in his thoughts and actions and permits his mind to dwell on lewd, lascivious, selfish or improper things, he thereby lets down the bars or guards that have been erected against the demons, and therefore the demons invade his mind. Attending and participating in social parties and thus wasting time and energy that might be properly employed in the Lord’s service is a very dangerous course of action, because the barriers to the intrusion of the demons are thus let down.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>43</sup> Study classes and service meetings are regularly held amongst the Lord’s people for the purpose of enabling them to keep in mind the proper things and their mind fixed upon the righteous things of the Lord. Every one of God’s covenant people should attend such meetings when it is reasonably possible and take an active part therein. One who is negligent and not attending such study classes is failing to seek righteousness and meekness, which the Lord requires of all whom he approves.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> Said Jesus: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” (John 5:17) That text announces the rule that everyone should work. One who has covenanted to serve God and his kingdom must do works of righteousness. With him the Kingdom interests are all-important at all times. He will not content himself by devoting seven to ten hours per day to doing work in the office or factory of the Lord’s organization, or by going from house to house telling the people of the Kingdom. He will not divide his time and his energy between such service work and other things out of harmony with the Kingdom. He will devote himself wholly and entirely to matters pertaining to the Kingdom; as it is written: “And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.”—Col. 3: 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>47</sup> The work in which the Christian engages is not for the benefit of or profit to the Lord, but the Lord affords his covenant people the opportunity to work that they might prove their unqualified devotion to Jehovah and his kingdom. It will therefore not do to say, “I will perform my assigned task and then I will spend the rest of the time jazzing about attending social gatherings and indulging in that which gratifies the imperfect human desires.” A man who is in a covenant to serve Jehovah is the bond servant of the Lord and must see to it that he gives his all to the service of the Lord and Master. God has given his covenant people the opportunity to prove their integrity toward him and to receive life everlasting. Therefore he admonishes his people, “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling [fearing lest one fail to please God] : for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Do all things without murmurings and disputings; that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.”—Phil. 2:12-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> Satan and other demons are arrayed in battle against all who have taken their positive stand for Jehovah and his King. Why give advantage to the enemy by having fellowship with the works of wickedness and the works of iniquity? To associate with the workers of iniquity or wickedness is to open the door to the demons, inviting them to come in and assault you, and is therefore equivalent to laying down the weapons of defense which the Lord has provided for his people. The conflict today is a real one between the demons and the covenant people of God. There could be no compromise and nothing in common between them. Those who receive God’s protection and final approval must seek righteousness and do what is right at all times, and not merely a part of the time. Both mind and hands must be employed in works of righteousness all the time in order to successfully withstand the assaults of the enemy. The people of God must have on the armor which the Lord has provided for them, and must use it at all times. That armor is specifically described at Ephesians 6:13-18 and shows that the one who has that armor must be a faithful servant of the Lord at all times. The Scriptures are provided by the Lord for his covenant people that they may be fully equipped for every good work. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) One who neglects to study the Scriptures and to be guided by the advice and admonition there given cannot have the approval of the Lord. We must study his Word and do his works, that we may receive his approval. —2 Tim. 2:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> All who seek refuge under the Lord’s organization, the antitypical “city of refuge”, must be obedient to the rules of the Lord’s organization, one of which announced is the following scripture, which applies both to the remnant and the “other sheep” of the Lord: “See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the spirit.”—Eph. 5:15-18.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> Walking circumspectly, within the meaning of the foregoing scripture, means to keep one’s eyes open and looking about and seeing to it that one makes straight paths for his feet to avoid the snares of the enemy. Excess in everything should be avoided. To keep covenant with the Lord means to diligently obey His commandments; and once learning them, one must obey them: “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. For thy name’s sake, 0 Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.”—Ps. 25:10-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>51</sup> Both the remnant and the Jonadabs must now “gird up the loins of your mind, be sober”. (1 Peter 1:13) Be watchful and faithful in the performance of duty, and at the same time avoid the “beggarly elements” of this wicked world, and bend all efforts and all energy to the service of The Theocratic Government and its King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>52</sup> The Devil is the great waster, and with his host of wicked ones is attempting to waste all things of righteousness. Any person today who has made a covenant to do the will of God and who then becomes indifferent and slothful concerning the work and service for The Theocracy or any other proper work to which he is assigned is thereby opening the way for the demons to completely control him. “He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.” (Prov. 18:9) “The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.” —Prov. 21: 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” It is observed that at the present time there are those amongst the consecrated who have children, and who have failed to put their children to work and who fail to even encourage them to work. They proceed upon the theory that the children must be left to their own desires for idleness and play. In this the parents are doing a great injury to the children and to their own selves. For the protection and betterment of the child every child should be taught the Word of God and righteousness and the necessity to obey God’s commandments. That child should also be assigned to a daily task or duty, and the parents should see to it that the child is diligent to perform the assigned task or duty. If the parents fail to do this they are doing great injury to their own children as well as to themselves. The children should be taught to keep themselves clean in body and clean in mind and to indulge only in that which is pure and righteous. The Jonadabs must now see to it that both they and their children keep themselves busily engaged in the work of righteousness and keep their place of abode and themselves in a cleanly manner and be diligent at all times to ascertain and to do the will of God. Keep in mind the admonition which Jehovah has given to such: “Seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—Zeph. 2: 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>54</sup> Concerning those who will compose the “great multitude” it is written that they serve the Lord and his kingdom “day and night”, that is to say, all the time. Let none of them now think it is sufficient and in fulfillment of their covenant to spend part of the hours distributing literature or manufacturing the same, and then to employ the remainder of their time in foolish things, such as social parties or “jazzing about”. Some time is required for study and meditation and careful planning the work that is to be done. The time is brief, and there is much to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>35</sup> Let everyone now on the earth who is in a covenant to do the will of God have in mind at all times these things, to wit: We have taken our position on the side of The Theocracy and openly declared ourselves for Jehovah and his King. The demons, led by Satan their chief, together with all of the organization of that wicked one, are arrayed against us and seek our destruction. We desire to win. We must win, and there is only one way to win, and that is, by the grace and strength of the Lord. We must give heed to and obey his commandments, else we fail. We must constantly study to know his will and what he would have us do that we may have his approval, protection and blessings. And what shall we do f</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> 'He hath shewed thee, 0 man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God ?” (Mic. 6:8) That scripture contains the answer for both the remnant and the “other sheep” of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>37</sup> “To do justly” means to do that which is right, that which is just and righteous. The command of the Lord is to “seek righteousness”; and seeking righteousness, one must do that which is right and righteous. One must be entirely for Jehovah and his kingdom, with no deviation from that course.

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WHAT BODY IS RAISED?</span></h4>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font4">SK a so-called “orthodox” clergyman about this and he will answer to this effect: “When death occurs the soul, which is immortal, departs and goes back to God, and the body is put into the tomb. When the resurrection trump is sounded the soul is brought back, and the same body which that soul once possessed will be resurrected, and the soul and body will again be united.’ That theory is so completely out of harmony with the Scriptures, of course, that it is hardly worth considering; but many have believed that theory regardless of how unreasonable and unscriptural it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In discussing the resurrection of the dead in the graves the inspired apostle Paul said, among other things: “But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.” (1 Cor. 15: 38) Then he adds, at verse 44: “It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.” The question at once arises, What did the apostle mean by the word “it” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the Scriptural definition of “soul”, the creation of which is described at Genesis 2:7, no soul can exist without a body. Man’s body of flesh was first made from the elements of the earth, and then the breath of life was breathed into it; and by this union a moving, sentient creature or “soul” came into existence. That soul, like all other human souls, consisted of a will, mind, heart and bodily organism. A soul could no more exist without a body than it could without the breath of life. That being true, when a man dies it is the soul that dies; hence there is no soul to which a body could be resurrected. When the soul or creature is resurrected that soul or creature must be made up of will, mind, heart and body, with the breath of life causing the organs of the body to function; and therefore there could be no occasion to say that the soul or creature is brought forth and given a body. By the inspired Scriptures we know to a certainty that the dead are dead, unconscious and completely out of existence until God’s due time to awaken them in the resurrection. We speak of death as “sleep” because of God’s purpose to awaken the dead that are in the graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first one resurrected from the dead was Jesus Christ. “And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead , that in all things he might have the pre-eminence.” (Col. 1:18) “The Christ” is composed of Jesus the Head and the church, which is “his body” and being composed finally of 144,000 members. (See Revelation 7:4-8 and 14:1-3.) It is not unusual for the Scriptures to refer to The Christ collectively, or as one. In his prayer on the night preceding his being nailed to the tree Jesus prayed in behalf of his disciples who had been faithful, and also in behalf of those others who should come into a like precious relationship with him. His prayer, as recorded in John, chapter 17, was that these all might be made one. (Vs. 21) That this thought was in the mind of the apostle Paul is clearly proved by his words when he refers to all anointed Christians as “one body”, meaning The Christ.—See 1 Corinthians 10:17; Ephesians 4: 4, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Taking the entire chapter fifteen of his first letter to the Corinthians together, what is the paramount question for determination? It is this: Was Christ raised from the dead? Satan, acting through his visible representatives on</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">earth, had tried to destroy all the evidence concerning the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Jewish priests and other clergymen bribed witnesses to lie concerning his resurrection. Of course, Satan was using every possible means to destroy men’s faith in the resurrection of Christ. (See Matthew 26:63-65; 28:11-15.) An examination of the entire chapter (1 Corinthians 15) discloses these cardinal points, to wit: (1) That the resurrection of Christ is the paramount question at issue. (2) That this resurrection includes the body members of The Christ with the Head thereof, and that all constitute one. And (3) that the “it” mentioned in verse 44 and other places in this same chapter does not mean the soul, the new creature, the ego, the character, entity or identity, and has no reference to an individual, but that the “it” means The Christ, the anointed of God, “Christ” meaning “anointed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At verses 35-38 the apostle’s argument is, in substance : 'I have shown you that Christ was raised from the dead and that the resurrection of all others depends upon that great fact. But opponents of the truth of the resurrection will raise some captious questions. Some among them who deny the resurrection will say, How can the dead be raised ? With what body do they come? Those are foolish questions. I will give you an illustration: When you sow a seed no life springs from it except it first die. If you sow wheat, that grain of wheat dies and a body comes forth. If you sow some other grain, that grain dies and a body comes forth. The same body or grain that you put into the ground does not come forth. God has provided a body, and will provide a body for every seed according to its kind. If it is wheat seed a body of that kind will come forth, or if some other seed a body that is suitable.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At verses 39-41 the argument is, in substance: ‘As a further illustration: All flesh is not the same. There are human flesh and cattle and birds and fishes, all of different flesh. Bodies are not all the same. You look above you, and see the heavenly bodies; and you look about you, and you see earthly bodies. They are different in glory. That is the way it will be in the resurrection; there will be some heavenly bodies and some earthly, and they will be different in glory.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At verses 42-44 the argument is, in substance ‘But now I am writing you Christians concerning the resurrection of Christ, which is disputed by our opponents The all-important question is his resurrection, because without his resurrection all other resurrection is impossible. In this same letter I have shown you that although The Christ is made up of many members, yet they form one body; The Christ is one. By one spirit all of us Christians are baptized into one body. [“Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”—1 Cor. 12:12-27] The body of Christ, consisting of the members in particular on this earth, is a dying body. It is a body of humiliation. It is weak and dishonorable in the sight of men. Christ Jesus, the Head of The Christ, went into death dishonored of men; and all the members of the body of Christ must follow the same course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘Therefore concerning the resurrection of Christ I say unto you: </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“It</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] is sown in corruption, </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] is raised in incorruption; </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] is sown in dishonour; </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] is raised in glory; </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] is sown in weakness; </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] is raised in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">155</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">power; </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] is sown a natural body; </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] is raised a spiritual body.” [Vss. 42-44] The Christ on earth anointed of God is a body of humiliation, a natural body. In the resurrection it is a spiritual body of glory and honor. “Christ” means “Anointed One” of God. The anointing with his spirit takes place on earth. The body when anointed is natural or human. It is planted in death, and then God raises it up out of death and gives it a body as it pleaseth him.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At verses 45-50 the argument is, in substance: You know that it is written in the Scriptures that Adam, the first man, who was to give life to the human race, was “made a living soul”. That soul or person or creature was made by forming the body from the elements of the earth and then breathing into it the breath of lives. That human soul failed because of sin. The last Adam, The Christ, is a life-giving spirit when completed in the resurrection, and will give life to the obedient ones of the human race; and there is no other means given under heaven whereby mankind can get life, except through Christ Jesus. (John 10:10) The spiritual was not made first: the animal was made first, and later comes the spirit. Christ must die as the animal body and be raised out of death a spiritual body, because such is God’s purpose. Those who are now devoted to God and who are in Christ are men. Our human nature is animal, our body is animal, and we are members of the body of Christ, and we are in humiliation. We must go down into death in the image of Christ Jesus, as when he died, and then we shall bear the image of the heavenly in the resurrection.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But suppose one who heard Paul’s argument at that time should have said: “But, Paul, may I ask a question? You have stated that </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘it’</span><span class="font4"> is sown in corruption, and that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘it’</span><span class="font4"> means Christ. Did Jesus Christ have a corruptible body ? Was it not written of him that his body did not see corruption ?”—Ps. 16: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To this the apostle would answer: ‘True, it was written concerning the Lord Jesus that his literal body did not see corruption. That body would have corrupted, because it was an animal body, except for the miracle performed by Jehovah our Father, who in his own good way and for his own good purposes dissolved that body to the dust that it should not see corruption. But every member of the body of Christ, which is the church, is imperfect; and therefore </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> must go into death a corruptible body, and in the resurrection God raises up The Christ incorruptible. As I said to you, the seed which you sow is not the body which comes forth, but God gives that seed a body suitable to its kind. The Christ is the seed of promise, which seed God promised to Abraham. (Galatians 3:16) That seed is sown a natural body. It pleases God to give that seed at the resurrection a spiritual body. Now I assure you, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither can a corruptible body be in the kingdom of God.’— 1 Cor. 15: 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At verses 51-55 the argument is, in substance: ‘Now I will disclose to you a mystery and a secret concerning the resurrection. The faithful members of the body of Christ who go into death prior to his second coming, as he promised, shall be out of existence until the coming of the Lord; and in that day he shall raise them up. But some members of the body that remain on earth till the time of his coming will not sleep in death, but at death will be instantaneously changed from an animal to a spiritual body. This will take place in a moment, because all members of the body of Christ must be changed from animal to spiritual in order to be of The Christ. The body this side the veil of death and which is corruptible must put on incorruption; the mortal must put on immortality. When this change takes place from corruptible to incorruption, and this mortal has become the immortal Christ, then shall be brought to pass the saying of God’s prophet: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” Then can be said: “O death, where is thy sting ? O grave, where is thy victory ?” Those who shall constitute the glorious body of Christ will never be subject to the power of death.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The conclusion is irresistible that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”</span><span class="font4"> refers to The Christ. With the exception of Jehovah God, no one outside of The Christ will ever be incorruptible. It is to The Christ alone that the promise is given that over such the second death will have no power. (See Revelation 2:11; 20:6.) None outside of Christ will ever receive immortality. These are they that are admonished while on earth to seek immortality. (Rom. 2:7) The members of The Christ while on earth are, by God’s will and his precious promises, begotten to an “inheritance incorruptible, . . . reserved in heaven”, which is life divine in the spirit. (See James 1:18; 1 Peter 1:1-4; 2 Peter 1:3, 4.) No others are begotten to this incorruptible inheritance, which is immortality. No others will ever have even a chance of being immortal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In using the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”,</span><span class="font4"> which he says is sown corruptible and is raised incorruptible, the apostle does not refer to individual souls or creatures or characters or entities or egos, but his reference is to </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Christ as a whole.</span><span class="font4"> If, when he says that God gives it a body as it pleases him, the apostle means each individual, and that some of these get mortal bodies and others immortal bodies, the apostle would be manifestly inconsistent; because later and in the same argument he says that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”</span><span class="font4"> must “put on immortality”. On this very snag the clergy of “Christendom” have fallen They contend that at the resurrection every one will be given an immortal body, and they use this statement of the apostle Paul as authority. But that is not what the apostle said at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the general resurrection during the thousand-year reign of Christ “all that are in the graves” will be raised up with a human body. Long before the time of the apostle Paul patient Job wrote: “And though, after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” (Job 19:26) Job believed in and spoke of the resurrection The apostle, of course, was familiar with this, and doubtless those Christians at Corinth to whom he wrote were familiar with the same scripture. Other prophets had taught the resurrection of the dead.—Dan. 12:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That question concerning dead humankind coming forth in human bodies was not troubling the Corinthians at all. The apostle was telling them about the resurrection of The Christ, and this they could not understand. The apostle was telling them about a change from human to spirit creature. If the question propounded to the apostle, ‘With what body shall the dead come forth ?’ had reference to the general resurrection of humankind the apostle would not have given the answer, ‘Thou foolish person.’ On the contrary, he would have said; ‘You are familiar with what the prophets have taught. A man is dead and in the tomb. He went down into death a human creature, and he will be brought forth a human creature under the kingdom of God by Christ Jesus.’ This is further proof that the apostle was not discussing the general resurrection, but that he was discussing the first resurrection, the resurrection of The Christ, and showing that the general resurrection absolutely depends upon the resurrection of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle and the others knew that the general resurrection would be in a body known to man; but the apostle did not know what kind of body God would give The Christ. The apostle John writes: “It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he [the Lord] shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.” (1 John 3:2) The apostle Paul, being also an inspired witness of God, would know exactly the same things as expressed by John. Therefore Paul’s answer to the question concerning the resurrection of The Christ was: ‘God will give </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font4"> [The Christ] a body as it pleaseth him’; and it will be a glorious body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Christ,” God’s great mystery, was hid from all for ages and generations. (See Colossians 1: 26, 27; Romans 16 :25,26.) That mystery was first made known to Christ Jesus after he was anointed with God’s spirit after his baptism in the river Jordan. It began to be uncovered and made known to the followers of Christ Jesus after Pentecost, fifty days after his resurrection from the dead. In God’s due time Paul became an apostle of Jesus Christ, and the mystery was revealed to him. He then wrote that those who will inherit the realms of glory must be of Christ. He stated that the true church while on earth is the body of Christ in the flesh, and that this body is suffering ignominy, persecution and shame at the hands of the enemy, even as Christ Jesus the Head suffered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a member of the body of Christ, Paul wrote: “I Paul am made a minister; who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church; whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which Is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God, even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles [the nations] ; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”—Col. 1: 23-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was concerning this mystery or glorious resurrection of The Christ that the apostle was writing to the Corinthians. He knew that if these Christians were to turn away from the great truth of the resurrection of Christ they could never be of the glorious body of Christ. His argument, therefore, was for the purpose of showing them that Christ died and was raised from the dead according to the purpose of Jehovah God; that The Christ is made up of many members, yet all one body; that as the Head suffered, the body must also suffer; that </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”,</span><span class="font4"> The Christ, must go down into death in dishonor and weakness and shame, and that God would raise </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”</span><span class="font4"> up to honor, power, glory and immortality. His argument is clear, cogent and convincing, and brings joy to the heart of the Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now the “remnant” on the earth, who are the last members of the body of Christ, can appreciate the promise of God made through Jesus: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.” (Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> Those who bear the reproaches that came upon the Head, and who go down into death with him, faithful to the end, shall be granted in the resurrection great honor of life divine in the spirit, and be for ever members of the glorious body of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When a Christian dies, to say that his “character” is somewhere in existence and that that is what will be resurrected is without meaning. The character is the man or creature. No man </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">has</span><span class="font4"> a character, separate and distinct from himself. If he is a man he is a character. If the man dies the character is dead. Man is a soul, and when the man dies the soul is dead. Man is a creature; when the creature dies the creature is dead, regardless of whether it is an old creature or a “new creature”. The apostle’s argument was that the “new creature”, a member of Christ, remains dead until the time of the resurrection, which takes place during the second presence of the Lord in the spirit. The creature when dead is nowhere; it is out of existence, and in due time shall be awakened out of death by being brought again into existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a man goes into the grave not ever having known Christ, his opportunity to be brought to a knowledge of the truth is during the reign of Christ. Then the man will be awakened out of death in the general resurrection after the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors have filled this earth with a righteous race, and he will be given a knowledge of the truth and an opportunity for life through Christ. But surely there is no question about what kind of body he will have when he comes forth from the grave in the resurrection. He could have no other kind of body than a human body. It is likewise certain that he would not have the identical body that went down into the tomb; but, nevertheless, he would have a human body given to him at the general resurrection. This question, however, was not really discussed by the apostle Paul, except that he said that during the reign of Christ those in the grave would be brought forth from the tomb. Not so, however, with the members of The Christ. They come forth as spirit creatures, but with what kind of body no man on this earth has ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1 Corinthians chapter 15 the apostle was not discussing the individual members of Christ’s body separately; he was discussing The Christ as a whole. In Revelation 3:12 the promise is made to individuals that those who are overcomers will be made a part of the spiritual temple of God. It would not be possible, however, to be of the temple except one is a member of Christ. When discussing The Christ, if the individual and separate members are kept out of mind and The Christ is considered as one, Head and body, then it is clear what the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”</span><span class="font4"> in 1 Corinthians 15 means. </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“It,”</span><span class="font4"> The Christ, goes into death as a human creature, with a human organism, and comes forth with a divine organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Confusion on this question, as on others, has resulted from thinking that each Christian must ‘develop a character’ when he becomes a “new creature” in Christ, and that each new creature exists inside of a human organism, and that when death ensues the body dies, but the new creature continues to live somewhere and will be resurrected and given a body as pleases the Lord. Confusion is bound to result when we have the wrong premise. When we get the proper understanding of what the “new creature” is and the proper understanding of “character”, then it is easy to see what the apostle meant when he spoke of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”</span><span class="font4"> : that he had reference to The Christ, the seed of God’s promise, which constitutes “the mystery of Christ”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No one will be resurrected as a member of the body of Christ unless while in the flesh he grows into the likeness of Christ Jesus. But this likeness is not so-called “character” likeness, as has been erroneously stated through misunderstanding that the character is something separate and distinct from the man. The likeness of the Lord spoken of in the Scriptures is an unqualified, unswerving and absolute devotion of the creature to Jehovah God; and never, sympathetically or otherwise, allying oneself with any part of the Devil’s organization and its religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jehovah has been during the past nineteen centuries developing and is now completing the “new creation”, which is The Christ. (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15) This new creation stands out separate and distinct from Satan’s organization. When one is begotten and anointed of the invisible power or holy spirit of God and is then put on trial and proves his love for the Lord in the fulfillment of his covenant to do God’s will, Jehovah God will be faithful in the performance of his part of the covenant. Thus doing, the Christian is certain to have a part in the “first resurrection”. He therefore becomes a part of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”</span><span class="font4"> while in the flesh. If faithful unto death, he is a part of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“it”</span><span class="font4"> that is resurrected to immortality.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THE IDEAL GOVERNMENT</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HAT man should have on earth an ideal government has been the purpose of Jehovah from the beginning of creation. For centuries the Creator, God, has been working out his purpose to that end. The Bible and the extraneous evidences in world events are cumulative that a climax in the progressive steps of his great purpose is now at hand. Blessed is the man who can now see and appreciate the fact, and can enter fully into the spirit of that divine arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An ideal thing is that which is perfect, supremely excellent; hence very desirable. An ideal government is a supremely excellent and perfect government. Because such a government seems impossible to man after long experience, man says: ‘An ideal government exists and can exist only in the imagination of men. It is unattainable and therefore impossible.’ With Almighty God it is not impossible; for in his due time such a government among men is absolutely certain. An abiding faith that this conclusion is correct, and the support of that faith by perfect love toward God, make the Christian a power in the hand of Jehovah God. When the Christian, under the supervision of the Lord, exercises that divinely given power, he is approximately living up to his privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The coming ideal government, and our attitude toward it, is the great issue. The word “issue” means the vital question for determination. It means the point to be decided. The question for determination or point to be decided, the paramount issue before the minds of men, is: Satan’s kingdom versus Jehovah’s Theocratic Government under Christ. Shall Satan continue to be the “god of this world” and rule with an oppressive hand? Or has the time come for the great God of heaven to set up an ideal government on earth ? This is the great issue in the campaign that is now on. Let every creature devoted to or of good-will toward God settle that in his mind now. There is no middle ground in this campaign. There is no compromise. Such creature must unreservedly take the side of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government under Christ or lose what he has. No real Christian can be passive in this campaign. He must be active as opportunities are afforded. He must be either cold or hot. To be lukewarm will not do. (See Revelation 3:16.) The more quickly this fact gets thoroughly fixed in the mind and heart, the better for the creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Zeal</span><span class="font4"> means to be heated. It is derived from the Greek word which means to boil. It means ardor for a cause, an enthusiastic fervor and devotion to that cause. The zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, referred to at Psalm 69:9, John 2:17 and Romans 15:3, is the boiling, enthusiastic fervor and devotion for God’s kingdom, for his ideal government over man. This is the time when zeal for the Kingdom or Theocracy is required. It means that one will be actively engaged in the campaign as opportunity is offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What, then, can I do? you ask. At Matthew 24:14 Jesus answers: Tell the good news of the Kingdom to the people of all nations as a witness before the end comes. Tell it now! Tell it by word of mouth. Proclaim it to the people as you have opportunity. Tell it out by the printed page by placing in the hands of the people the books and other literature containing the message of The Theocracy. The Lord has provided the printing presses and other machinery to print and manufacture the books in the various languages, and offers an opportunity to all devoted ones to enter actively into the campaign on the side of the great Theocrat. He has provided the way for some to be full-time publishers as pioneers and for others to be publishers as members of organized companies of Jehovah’s witnesses. He has provided sound-cars and sound-reproducing machines, portable phonographs, with recorded speeches, and provided for the sending forth of the message in that way. He has opened a way for every one who is on his side to do something in the campaign. Hence there is no just cause or excuse for any who really love the Lord to remain silent now. Remember the thousands who went with Gideon for the war and who at the water test bowed down, burying their faces in the brook to drink, and were rejected. Be not of that kind, but be of those who, like the approved 300, dipped the water in their hands and lapped it like a dog, while earnestly watching for opportunities to glorify the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be it remembered, we are now engaged in the greatest campaign of all time. Let us acquit ourselves as becomes the true representatives of the great and new Government, The Theocracy. Call to mind the campaign in worldly polities, how some have engaged therein in times past, how they endured hardships in behalf thereof. How many times have you carried a torch, marched in the ranks or rode in a wagon, waved a flag and shouted and urged the people to vote? How many times have you made a political speech, and diligently distributed literature showing the people what you believed to be the proper way to vote ? And why did you do it? If you were honest you did it because you believed that the officers you were trying to elect, the government you were trying to inaugurate, would help to bring about a better condition amongst the people in general. Those efforts failed because of the imperfections of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we are enlisted in a campaign of the Lord for his ideal government. We are not in doubt as to the result. We know that his kingdom will win. We know that his will be the ideal government and will bring the very things for which man has hoped and watched and prayed, lo, these many centuries past. Do you possess the spirit of the Lord ? Have you perfect love in your heart? If so, then with a burning zeal for his cause you will go forth to do your little part, not because he needs any of us but because we need the opportunity to prove our loyalty and our love. Remember that love is the perfect expression of unselfishness. Remember that the King of The Theocratic Government, Christ Jesus, gave us the example as Jehovah’s “Faithful and True Witness”, and that we must follow in his steps. The way for us now to give expression to unselfishness is joyfully to announce the kingdom that will bring lasting blessings to mankind. This must be done with diligence if we would have an abundant entrance into the Kingdom and into its blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How can anyone in “the present truth”, who appreciates the situation, remain silent and inactive? Let no one deceive you. If you are to be one of God’s “elect” you will not be deceived into believing you can be inactive and yet please the Lord. The Lord has promised that the “elect” shall not be deceived in doctrine. (Psalm 125:3; Isaiah 52:8; Matthew 24:24,25) There is a manifest attempt on the part of the great adversary of God and man to deceive by inducing those devoted to God to remain inactive and silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In ages past governments have risen, only to fall again. Now Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in a campaign for the ideal government which is certain and which will endure forever. Service will mean a sacrifice of worldly ease, wealth, and comfort. It will cost us much, but it is worth more than it costs. If we have started to serve the Lord, we cannot stop and still be pleasing to him. Do not for one moment think that what you did last year will win for you the Kingdom or its blessings. Our victory will be complete at the end, provided we do not relax. (Galatians 6:9) This is no time for quitters. Jesus made this clear when he said: “No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”—Luke 9: 62.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To humankind an ideal government is one the governor of which possesses absolute power and exercises that power always equally in behalf of all, and with partiality to none, granting to each one his full rights and privileges. It means a government of everlasting peace, in which the people will have plenty, will live in contentment, enjoy liberty, life and uninterrupted happiness. That is why, to man, an ideal government has seemed impossible. The kingdom of God and of his Christ will bring to man all of these and much more. That the ones devoted to Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government under Christ might be fully assured and be comforted and encouraged, the Lord has given us cumulative evidence of what blessings The Theocracy shall bring to obedient humankind on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are assured that Jehovah by Christ Jesus shall be king over all the earth (see Zechariah 14:9); that the government shall be upon the shoulders of Christ Jesus (Isaiah 9:6,7) ; that he shall have dominion from sea to sea and to the ends of the earth (Psalm 72: 8) ; that all power and authority are in the hands of God’s anointed King (Matthew 28:18) ; that out from Zion, Jehovah’s capital organization or Theocracy, which is heavenly and hence invisible, shall go forth the law (Isaiah 2:3); that the king shall rule in righteousness, therefore without partiality (Isaiah 32:1); that unto his kingdom shall all people of good-will be gathered (Genesis 49:10); that wars shall be no more and the people shall dwell in peace, and of his peace and his kingdom there shall be no end (Isaiah 2:4; and 9:6, 7) ; that the people shall have plenty and feast to their heart’s content (Isaiah 25:6); that the earth shall yield its increase and the people shall be supplied with an abundance (Isaiah 30:23; Psalm 67:6); that there shall be amongst the people no beastly organization to oppress them, for the Lord shall destroy the oppressor (Psalm 72:4); that every obedient man shall own his home and shall sit under his vine and fig tree and shall fear no one (Micah 4:1-4) ; that their flesh shall become fresher than that of a child (Job 33: 25) ; that none shall fear sickness nor be sick (Isaiah 33:24); that full regeneration to life will be granted to those who prove their loyalty to the King because he gave his life that all such shall live (John 3:15; 10:10) ; that then they that keep his Word shall never die (John 8:51; Revelation 21: 4) ; that the earth, created for man’s happiness, will be brought to a state of Edenic Paradise, and the desert will blossom with abundance (Isaiah 35:1) ; that every one will know of Jehovah, the great Theo-crat, and of his anointed King and Vindicator, Christ Jesus, and will dwell in endless happiness and sing songs of praise to Jehovah and his Christ for ever.—Isa. 11: 9; Ps. 150:6</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The kingdom of the Lord will establish an ideal condition upon the earth for man. That will be the ideal government, The Theocracy. There is not the slightest doubt in the mind of the Christian that such is true and that the Kingdom is now beginning. We are not following some cunningly devised fable; but we have the sure Word of God spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets (2 Pet. 1:16-21) These prophecies have been and are being fulfilled; and we know that the foretold Dayspring from on High has visited humankind of good-will and that the portals of the New World are swinging open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God will make a sharp and quick work of announcing the Kingdom before the complete end of Satan’s wicked world. (Isaiah 28:22, Romans 9:28) The time is short now till the universal war of Armageddon, and the privileges are great beyond the description of human words. The issue is clearly drawn; the fight is on to the finish, the campaign grows with intensity. The Theocratic Government is at hand. The God-given commission is to now tell the good news to the world. Blessed is the man who fulfills that commission. Witness of Jehovah, with zeal and vigor press on to victory and boundless joy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMAN GIRL REFUGEE NOW PIONEERS IN ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“During the ten years I have been privileged to serve as a pioneer I have never had so much joy and encouragement as just during the last few weeks. In one instance, a gentleman, very interested in the Catholic religion, a few years ago had the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font4"> sent to him. He enjoyed reading it, but never heard any more about its message, till perhaps a month ago. Hearing the recorded lecture ‘Government and Peace’, he was so thrilled, ‘Every single word is true,’ was one of his remarks and he asked for all the books and two or three dozen booklets. Each morning he is giving lifts in his car to some people and is using every opportunity to speak about the truth. Then he gives them a booklet with his name and address inside and asks them to call at his house in case they want to know more. In the meantime he and his wife and daughter have heard our two new lectures and are now having a model study in their home. Also they attended service meeting and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study on Sunday, and he has offered his car to all witnesses in his district to take them on the work Sundays. He was anxious to tell his sister who lives in London about the truth, and in her reply she said she has been associated with our Society since 1914. Such a surprise! In another instance, a gentleman and lady had heard about the truth sixteen years ago through some witnesses next to them. They had many arguments, but never agreed. Through moving they lost contact. A few months back these people tried to give a lift to two persons waiting for a bus. They stopped, but could hardly believe their eyes when they realized they were speaking to their old neighbors. It took two hours to do the journey normally done in fifteen minutes, and resulted in giving them the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span><span class="font4"> Two weeks ago I arranged with the lady to call with the lecture. Last Monday night they listened to ‘Religion’. Both said, ‘The more you hear, the more you want to know.’ The first time I called I left two copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> I didn’t want to take anything. He was most upset, and so he put three shillings in my pocket. On my last back-call with the recordings I asked his wife to accept two books and some </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> copies as a small gift from me, which she appreciated very much. Before I realized it, he had put three more shillings in my pocket. They asked about meetings. When I offered to call for them, they said they would come to fetch me instead and take me down in their car. As I was leaving they both seemed quite concerned and asked if I had somebody here in Sheffield to look after me. It was a great pleasure to tell them that the people I am staying with are as kind to me as my own parents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WORKING THE CITY JAIL BUILDING (NEBRASKA)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I went straight to the elevator and asked to be taken to the top floor. Before I got off I witnessed to the elevator man, and that contrary to my regular course. I thought I had made a mistake, but, much to my surprise, he readily took </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font4"> smiled broadly and said: ‘I have taken these from you before. I am for you.’ He then took me to the office of the radio broadcaster and let me in. Whenever the elevator man could run away he would come in and stay until they rang for him, and we almost had a study there. At the prosecutor’s office my reception was much different. How did I get into the building </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font4"> should be locked up! My days for doing this work were numbered, and I and the rest of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">us would be dealt with the same here as in other parts of the country! I told him that that was a great responsibility he was taking upon himself and he would not be able to do one thing until the Lord permitted. So much attention was drawn to me that I had little interest from then on. They were all very fearful on that floor. Every little while the elevator man would walk by to see how I was getting along. He would tell me not to be afraid, not to let them bluff me. Finally I got to the first floor. I was five hours in this building. I got to the captain. He smiled, so amused, and said: ‘Well, hello there! the last time I saw you, you had an escort down here!’ and he laughed heartily. He is a Catholic. I witnessed and he admitted he knew religion is a racket and that we are harmless. He told me to come into his private office and meet the rest of the boys. When they found that one of Jehovah’s witnesses was there they were anxious to hear what I had to say. The switchboard operator came from the next room and asked, and I told him I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He said, ‘Why, I have had fifteen complaints from here in the building, asking why you were not locked up.’ Then the captain saw I had slipped one over on him. He wanted to be angry, scolded me for going through as I did, and said after this I </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font4"> get an order or permission from the chief. Then the switchboard operator asked where the soul went at death. I quoted scriptures and told him that where man’s word differs from the Scriptures man is the liar, not God. He saw what I meant His switchboard was buzzing, bells were ringing, and no one paying attention! All interested in the witness. After I finished he went to his office and said to one of the fellows there: ‘I’ll never go to that d----church again!’ Then you</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">could hear, ‘That’s right! Religion is a racket. She’s right! That’s the truth!’ all talking at once. In the building I placed two bound books and many booklets. The elevator man asked me to be sure to come back, and showed me how much he had read of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font4">—between calls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCHOOL BOARD APPEARS BEFORE JEHOVAH’S WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Grammar school decided everyone must salute the flag </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or else!</span><span class="font4"> That put my 12-year-old daughter out automatically. I could not get up and go to see the board of trustees; so I wrote a letter to the man who made the motion to adopt compulsory saluting. He is also justice of the peace and runs the leading service station here in town I invited him and his colleagues to call and hear our side of the issue more fully. This he did. He came believing in salutes from everybody. He left, and another trustee with him, all wobbly and reeling in their convictions, and in distress because of the position in which my girl had been placed. They took </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font4"> home with them. Then they ‘went to town’ on the school principal, the teacher, and the third member of the board, with the result that the whole silly ruling was quashed, and my girl was back in school by 10 o’clock the morning after the visit. She was out only a week, in which I taught her at home. I am convinced there was no malicious intent on the part of the trustees. New instructions have been sent out to school boards from the inner sanctum of the higher-ups, and among the ‘suggestions’ for adoption by each individual board is this vicious compulsory salute ruling. This neatly circumvents California’s governor’s veto on the state-wide adoption of such a law. Clever guys (?).”</span></p>
