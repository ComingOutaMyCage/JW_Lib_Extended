<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah's kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The midsummer Testimony Period, as above named, includes all of August.

Therefore during this Testimony Period the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> together with the latest published booklet will be placed with everyone possible, on a contribution of 25c. This, which is generally the vacation season and convention time, should allow for many newly interested ones to start out into the field activity, and for ah veteran publishers to get in their full quota of hours. A good report is awaited from each and all at the close of August, marking the special blessing of the Lord upon all that “serve him with one consent”.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTEGRITY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever&quot;—Ps. 41:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TEHOVAH’S purpose to have the world ruled by I his righteous Government is repeatedly empha-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6"> sized in the Scriptures. His Government is the Theocracy over which he has made Christ Jesus the King. It is the kingdom for which Jesus directed all of God’s children to earnestly pray, ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done in earth as it is done in heaven.’ It is the means by which Jehovah will fully vindicate his holy name; and therefore The Theocracy is the greatest and most important doctrine. For many centuries Christian people believed that God’s chief purpose is to save souls from death. In that they greatly erred.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s promise is that “the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day”. (Prov. 4:18) Since Christ Jesus came to the temple the light upon the pathway of God’s people has shone with ever-increasing brilliancy to them, and now we stand at the very portals of the perfect day. Now it is clearly seen that while individual salvation is important, that which is of greatest importance is the vindication of Jehovah’s name and that all who will enter into God’s great organization, and thus receive salvation, must be ardent supporters and advocates of Jehovah’s name and Kingdom. Since The Theocracy is the means of vindicating Jehovah’s name, The Theocracy is vital to the existence of all who shall receive life everlasting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Today we see the wicked powers of this world fighting desperately for world domination and that they are rapidly approaching the final climax; and at the same time we behold the triumphant entrance of the King of The Theocracy, whose rule of the world shall be holy and righteous. Today is the time toward which faithful men have looked during all the centuries past, and now the Kingdom has come and the King is upon his throne. The creature’s greatest privilege and his highest attainment is to have a part in that Theocratic Government.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">* Who shall be exalted in the Theocratic organization? and who shall stand in that righteous government? Only those who are wholly devoted to The </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy ; and thus the Scriptures answer: “He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.” —Ps. 24: 4, 5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> The one who enters and stands there must be clean, and not contaminated by any part of Satan’s organization or by touching the same. He must have a pure heart; that is, his motive must be entirely unselfish. He must be sincere, steadfast and blameless in his devotion to the Kingdom and be entirely free from hypocrisy and deceit. All who are made members of that righteous government, and all who receive a commission from and who serve under that government, must be crucially tested and each approved one must meet that test successfully. Each one who is of The Theocracy or who serves with approval under it must hold fast his integrity. David as the king of Israel, or typical Theocracy, was a type of Christ the King of glory, and the utterance of that typical king applies to The Christ, Head and body. David was fiercely beset by his enemies, and likewise today the prospective members of the Kingdom who are on the earth are severely attacked by the enemies. David exclaimed: “By this I know that thou favour-est me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.”—Ps. 41:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> The fact that his enemies did not triumph over him was to him a sure token from Jehovah that he had received the favor of the Most High. Now those who proclaim The Theocratic Government and hope for complete entrance thereinto with confidence likewise say: ‘I know Jehovah favors me, because he has prevented the enemies from overwhelming me.’ As David said, so now those who likewise hope for deliverance say: “And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.” (Ps. 41:12) Thus it is seen that all who shall stand in favor before the Lord must hold fast their integrity and never be found deficient therein. It is God’s chosen people whom he has called for his purpose; who must now remain steadfast and im-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">movable for The Theocracy, that shall receive the everlasting blessings of the Lord. The salvation of each one of such depends upon complete loyalty and faithfulness to The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PICTURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has made and recorded in the Bible many prophetic pictures disclosing his purpose to create and set up his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Among such pictures is the one in which Job prominently appears; and that picture is of peculiar interest to God’s covenant people at the present time. That great prophetic drama pointed forward to the coming of The Theocratic Government in power and glory and disclosed the narrow and trying way in which creatures must walk who enter that government. The faithful men of old by faith walked in that way. Christ Jesus took the lead and made clear the way of testing which leads to victory and glory. Now Christ Jesus has come and his faithful servants behold the fulfillment of the prophetic drama about completed. This knowledge gives strength and increases the hope of the faithful servants of the Most High, particularly at this time of great distress upon the earth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> When the light of the Lord had not so fully enlightened the minds of his people as it does now it was thought that the picture of Job included the entire human family, to whom God would grant the “blessings of human restitution on the earth”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> publication pointed out what was thought to be Jehovah’s purpose to give restitution to all obedient ones of mankind and that the Job prophetic drama included such. The increased light which the Lord has given to his people in these latter days makes it now to clearly appear that Job did not picture the entire human family who would be granted restitution. It is The Theocratic Government that is of paramount importance, and therefore the prophetic drama of Job includes the Head and body members of that government; it includes the faithful men of old who will be the earthly representatives of that government and rule amongst men, filling the places of visible governors, and also includes those who receive the divine commission from Jehovah and who act under that government to carry out that divine mandate to fill the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Christ Jesus and the 144,000 members of his body constitute the official Theocracy, that is, the Kingdom, the government created by and employed by Jehovah to vindicate his name and to carry out his purpose. That is the government that shall forever rule in righteousness. The faithful men from Abel to the last of the holy prophets include those named at the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, who shall be the governors or princes visible to men and acting for the invisible Christ, and therefore officials and servants of The Theocracy acting by command and under the direction of The Theocratic Government. They shall rule in justice and execute the judgments of The Theocracy in righteousness. The Lord’s “other sheep”, who are carried over Armageddon and who receive the commission to form the “great multitude” and to carry out the divine mandate, will be servants under The Theocratic Government. These, as the Scriptures declare, shall come from the east and the west and sit with or be associated with and directed by the faithful governors in the earth. (Matt. 8:11) The prophetic picture of Job pointing to the main figures in the test primarily applies to Christ Jesus, and the members of his body, with special reference and emphasis to the remnant now on earth. The severe test to which Job was subjected foretold the test to which the members of The Theocracy are put; and a like test is put upon everyone who holds an official position under that righteous government. Each and every one nnder the test must hold fast his integrity in order to receive the approval of the Lord the King and of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HATE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> The name Job means- “hated”; hence to be persecuted by the enemy. Those pictured by Job are hated by all adversaries or enemies of the Kingdom, which enemies are hostile or at enmity with and against the purpose or purposes for which the Job class is used. Some texts following show the use of the word which is translated </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Job.</span><span class="font6"> When God pronounced judgment against the Devil He said thus: “And I will put enmity [hatred] between thee and the woman [picturing God’s universal organization], and between thy seed and her seed.”—Gen. 3: 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> “The seed” of Jehovah’s organization, which organization is pictured by the woman, is The Christ. (Gal. 3:27-29) Concerning that Seed it is written: “And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.” (Gen. 22:17) The prayer which God has put in the mouth of his people is: “So let all thine enemies [haters] perish, 0 Lord; but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.” (Judg. 5:31) The same root word is used in Job’s prayer: “Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.”— Job 27:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> Satan hated the perfect man Adam when he was perfect in Eden because Adam was God’s perfect creature and Satan coveted the worship which Adam properly gave to Jehovah. Satan brought about Adam’s downfall. Since then Satan has not so much hated the imperfect offspring of Adam who have yielded to the Devil’s influence, but his great hatred has been leveled -against those who have devoted themselves to Jehovah and remained loyal to God. These he has not hated because they are the offspring naturally of Adam, but because their devotion has been and is to the Most High. This is particularly shown in the sons of Adam. Abel was faithful to God, and Satan hated him for that reason and caused Cain to show hatred by killing Abel.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The deadly enmity of Satan was shown toward the man Jesus. Repeatedly Satan tried to bring about the destruction of Jesus; and that was due to the fact that Jesus was at all times faithful and loyal to his Father, Jehovah. Jesus at all times is at enmity with Satan. Jesus hates wickedness and all wicked works: “Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”—Ps. 45:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Because of the love of Jesus for righteousness Jehovah has made him the owner by purchase of all of Adam’s race that put themselves on the side of God and Christ and faithfully remain there and obey. The fact that the ransom sacrifice paid by Jesus holds benefits only for believers who are obedient to God thus shows that the prophetic drama of Job does not picture or represent the human family as a whole, but that it represents only those who believe in God and in Christ, and who take their stand on the side of righteousness. Such are then subjected to the test of loyalty and faithfulness pictured by Jpb. Undergoing such test these must withstand the assaults of Satan and of the other demons and must remain faithful and true to the Theocrat and His King. During the millennial reign of Christ Jesus those of the human family who are brought forth from the grave will not be subject to the wicked influence and works of Satan. (Rev. 20:1-3) The prophetic drama of Job appears to apply to all persons who are hated and assaulted by Satan because of their devotion to The Theocratic Government. Since the “other sheep” of the Lord, who form the “great multitude”, are subjected to the test of loyalty before Armageddon and are hated and opposed and persecuted by Satan and his agents, such “other sheep” appear clearly to be embraced within the prophetic drama.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> There appears to be special application of the Job picture to the remnant now on earth. The apostle James refers to the Job picture, using it to give instruction to spiritual Israel, particularly those on earth at the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple, and wherein the apostle says: “The judge standeth before the door.” It is then that the servants of the Lord, the remnant, are subjected to the test: “Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. Grudge no^ one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.”—Jas. 5: 8-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> Christ Jesus as a man was the chief of those who love righteousness, who was hated of all enemies, and who at all times held fast his integrity and, like Job in the prophetic drama, he was qualified to act as an intercessor. (Job 1:5; Job 42: 8, 9) As Job was rendered childless and made exceedingly poor, so the man Jesus was made materially poor and childless and was subjected to all manner of persecution and through it all Jesus held fast his integrity. (Matt. 8: 20; 2 Cor. 8:9) Though reproached and persecuted by Satan and his agents, and also made to appear as afflicted by Jehovah, even as Job suffered and was made to appear, Jesus remained true and steadfast and loyal in his devotion to Jehovah.—Isa. 53: 2-4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ISSUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1T</sup> The issue between Satan and Jehovah was not raised for the first time in Job’s day, but centuries before that time. The prophetic drama of Job discloses what Jehovah requires of all creatures who shall receive his boundless blessings. While the question for determination raised by the prophetic drama was and is, “Can Jehovah put men on earth who, under the most severe test, will prove faithful and true to God!” yet that great issue embraces much more. The Scriptural record is that there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah and Satan came also among them. No doubt Satan there appeared in an arrogant and defiant manner, but it was then in respect to Satan’s boast that Jehovah put the question to Satan: &quot;Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect, upright man, one that feareth God and is without evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.’—Job 2:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> This shows that long before that time Satan had challenged the supremacy of Jehovah and raised the great issue. Many other Scriptures support that conclusion. Satan’s accusing charge was made before the angels of heaven, and hence was known among all the host of heaven, but not properly understandable and appreciated amongst men till the present time. God’s due time now appears when those on earth devoted to him are given an understanding of the real issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The primary issue raised by Satan’s defiant challenge was and is that of universal domination. God had created the earth and created man for the earth. A perfect man upon the earth would worship and serve Almighty God. (Isa. 45:12,18) When God laid even the foundations of the earth Satan had heard the announcement made to the sons of God and learned that much of Jehovah’s purpose. (Job 38:7) Then Satan, moved by covetousness, determined that he would have the worship of men for himself in the place and stead of Jehovah and that therefore he would be the ruler of the universe. (Jer. 51:13) Then it was that Satan began to act to accomplish his wicked purpose, as it is written: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.”—Isa. 14:13,14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> Because Jehovah is righteous and all his ways righteousness Satan chose the way of wickedness that he might turn creatures away from God, turn them into wickedness and rule according to his own selfish desire. He would rule the universe or ruin it. He seduced the many sons of God and brought about the debauchery of humankind, filling the earth with wickedness and violence, until God destroyed all flesh save Noah, a just man, and the members of his family. (Gen. 6:1-13) Following the flood Satan set up Nimrod as the first dictator among men and turned the people away from God and caused them to hail and worship the Devil’s representative as one mightier than Jehovah God. It was after that time that God directed the attention of Satan to faithful Job, and then the great prophetic drama was made. Jehovah would not destroy Job without a cause. Job had remained faithful and true to Jehovah and was rich in material things and surrounded by those who loved him. Satan challenged Jehovah to put Job to the test, and Jehovah permitted Satan to put the test upon Job without informing Job why he was being tested. Job knew that he had not willingly been disloyal, and therefore he could not understand why he, as a servant of God, should suffer. His suffering was a prophetic picture made for the benefit of others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TEST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> The test put upon Job was directly related to world domination, the issue being world domination; and Job being an example used to make the prophetic picture, the test put upon Job necessarily points to the requirements God makes of all who shall have to do with the rule of the world in righteousness. Jehovah had declared his purpose to set up his capital government of righteousness to rule the peoples of the world. Job would know of this promise because the promise had been made to his kinsman Abraham. In opposition to Jehovah Satan had declared that he would rule the world or ruin it. Jehovah had said to Satan: ‘You may go ahead and do what you can. I will permit you to remain for a time, but in the end I will cause my name to be declared throughout the earth and then I will show you my supreme power.’ (Ex. 9:16) With Job Jehovah was making a prophetic picture, chiefly for the instruction and comfort and hope of God’s devoted people who are now on the earth, at the end of the world.—Rom. 15: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> Job had faith in God and in his coming Theocratic Government by the Messiah, and for that reason Satan hated Job and attempted to cause him to repudiate Jehovah and to die. That the test put upon Job involved chiefly his loyalty to the King of The Theocracy is shown by these words of Job: “Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.”—Job 19:23-26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> The test put upon Job being a prophetic picture for the benefit of the remnant of God’s people, it follows that the crucial test must be applied after the Lord comes to the temple. That test is not for the purpose of determining whether or not the devoted covenant people of God are perfect in word or deed or character development. That test is to determine whether or not they* are completely and immovably devoted to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, which has now come to rule the world in righteousness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MEANING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> The meaning of the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">integrity</span><span class="font6"> is “innocence, blamelessness; that is, without fault”. Job stood for Jehovah and his promised Kingdom. God permitted Satan to afflict Job and cause him to suffer loss of everything, and still Job remained loyal to God. He held fast his integrity, and therefore was blameless before God. Was Job blameless because he was perfect in his organism and had the right to life? No; because he was the offspring of Adam and hence under condemnation. (Rom. 5:12) His integrity, or blamelessness, consisted in the fact that he refused to be moved from his steadfast devotion to God and his coming Kingdom by the Messiah. He would suffer all things rather than be unfaithful to The Theocracy. The prophetic drama therefore shows that the integrity of Job foretells that those whom Job pictured must be immovably devoted to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and that regardless of what the enemy is permitted to inflict upon them. They must remain faithful and true and wholly devoted to the Government of Righteousness. In no other way could they be blameless before God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> As further evidence that the issue is The Theocracy, and that the test is whether or not men who have agreed to obey God’s commandments will hold fast their integrity, note the unbroken line of testimony from Abel to the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple in power and glory. The apostle Paul, who had his heart set entirely on the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, summed up the matter as shown by the record at the eleventh chapter of Hebrews. There in substance he says ‘that Abraham was living in Ur, the land of enemies, the same land from whence Job came; that Abraham moved out, and into a country that he knew nothing about, and in that unknown country dwelt with his family in tents, because he relied upon Jehovah’s promise’. What promise? The Scriptural answer is that God would create and set up The Theocratic Government, which should rule the world in righteousness. The testimony of the apostle concerning Abraham is: “For he [Abraham] looked for a city [organized government] which hath foundations [solid, unbreakable and immovable], whose builder and maker is God [that is, the Almighty, the Creator].”—Heb. 11:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>26</sup> Continuing his testimony the apostle further says: “These all died in faith, not having received the promises.” What promises? we ask; and the Scriptural answer is, the promises that Jehovah God would make and set up his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, administered by faithful representatives on earth, and through which all the families of the earth that would obey might receive a blessing. Abraham and his sons believed the promises to be true, and relied upon them. The apostle continues: “But having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.” By faith they looked forward to the day when The Theocratic Government should be set up, and their hope was centered therein. “For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.” (Heb. 11:9-15) Those faithful men came out from the organized government controlled by the Devil, and because of their immovable devotion to The Theocracy they had no desire to return to Satan’s organization. Therefore says the apostle: “But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.” (Heb. 11:16) Their desire and hope was in the government which the God of heaven and earth was preparing, and they held fast to that hope; and because of their blamelessness God was nbt ashamed to acknowledge them as his servants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup> Were those faithful men of old, who had hope in The Theocratic Government, put to the test? They were, and suffered indescribable and horrible punishment at the hand of the Devil and his agents opposing The Theocracy. Concerning this the apostle further says: “Time would fail me to tell of Gedeon [who with a small band of 300 successfully fought the host of Midian, who oppressed and opposed the people of God who were of the typical Theocracy and who showed faith and devotion to the real Theocratic Government], and of Barak [who, because of his faith and devotion to The Theocracy, led his little army of ten thousand against a mighty host of the adversaries and defeated them, by God’s grace and power], and of Samson [who successfully fought the adversaries of the Theocracy and laid down his life for the cause of righteousness], and of Jephthae [who led the forces of Israel, the typical Theocracy, against the foes thereof, and gained, by God’s grace, a great victory and received the everlasting blessings of the Most High].” Such is the substance of the apostle’s argument. Those faithful men and their faithful women suffered all manner of punishment and violent death because of their complete devotion to The Theocracy. Those faithful creatures refused to compromise with Satan’s organization, and they died faithful to The Theocracy; and of them it is written, ‘The world was not worthy of them.’ What world? The world under Satan’s control, to be sure, the world of wickedness.—Heb. 11: 32-38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Then the apostle adds: “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise; God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” (Heb. 11: 39, 40) In other words, Jehovah has in store for those faithful men a great blessing but they must wait until The Theocratic Government is fully set up.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>29</sup> The first announcement made by Jesus Christ after his anointing was concerning the Kingdom, The Theocratic Government. Ever thereafter he put the Kingdom foremost. Satan employed every possible scheme and device to kill Jesus because he was and is the King of The Theocracy. When Satan’s religious representatives on the earth recognized Jesus the King they said: ‘This is the Heir to the throne; come, let us kill him.’ (Mark 12:7) Those representatives of Satan did kill Jesus because he is the King of The Theocratic Government. Jehovah raised Jesus out of death, exalted him to the highest place, and made him Lord and King of The Theocratic Government. That government not having been completed, Jesus must wait, as commanded by Jehovah, until due time for him to take his power, rule in righteousness, and exhibit his power against the enemy.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> The highest hope of the faithful apostles was the coming of Christ and his kingdom. They were persecuted, beaten and imprisoned because they advocated and proclaimed The Theocratic Government; they suffered martyrdom because they refused to compromise with Satan’s organization. Repeatedly punished because of their faithfulness; commanded to refrain from telling of the Kingdom, they answered: “We will obey God rather than men.’ They were hated by the ruling powers of the world, but that hatred originated with and emanated from Satan. Every person who has boldly advocated The Theocracy has been and is hated and persecuted by Satan and his representatives. To such Jesus says: ‘The servant is like the Lord: they have hated and persecuted me, and they will hate and persecute you also.’—John 15:20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CLIMAX</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> The climax must come sometime. In due time there must be a final showdown as to who shall rule the universe. But when must it come? The prophetic drama of Job was made to be fulfilled at the end of the world, where we now are. That end began when Christ Jesus was enthroned, in 1914, when the war began in heaven and Satan and other demons were cast down to the earth. Referring to that very time the Lord Jesus addresses these words to his faithful followers: “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.”—Matt. 24: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>32</sup> The facts today completely fulfill that prophecy uttered by Christ Jesus. Are men hated today because they are called Christians? No, not that. Those persons of the most powerful religious organization on earth, which men are bent on ruling the earth contrary to God’s will, are called Christians, and those hypocritical men are the ones that manifest the greatest hatred against Jehovah’s faithful servants. The faithful followers of Christ are hated today by all nations that are under Satan’s control, and that hatred is because such are witnesses for and advocates of the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. It is a part of the same conflict begun long ago, the Devil against righteousness. Now the King of righteousness has begun to exercise his power as King and the climax foretold by the prophetic drama of Job has come; and this is exactly in harmony with the admonition of the apostle addressed to the faithful ones now on earth. That admonition of the apostle emphasizes the fact that at the second coming of Christ Jesus those who will receive God’s approval must hold fast their integrity, or blamelessness. Desiring that his faithful brethren might receive the full approval of the Lord, the apostle says: “So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the earning of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.”-l Cor. 1:7-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> The only just conclusion that can be reached is that at the coming of Christ Jesus and the beginning of his reign as King the prophetic drama of Job would be fulfilled in completeness; and that then all who receive God’s approval must, as Job did, hold fast their integrity and stand blameless before the King. Furthermore, that the suffering of Job foretells a climax of suffering of God’s faithful witnesses at the present time and that amidst all of such suffering the approved ones must hold fast their integrity; that they must all speak the same thing, that is, this gospel of the Kingdom, The Theocratic Government, and that they must be in complete unity in action, perfectly joined together in their activities for The Theocratic Government.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">facts</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> IN FULFILLMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>84</sup> Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy, came to the temple in 1918 and began his judgment of those who claim to be his followers. Those who feared men quickly fell away to Satan’s organization. Those who trusted God and his King withstood the temple test and have been sent forth as the witnesses of the Lord and have since been subjected to all manner of persecution by the “evil servant” and religious leaders and supporters; and this persecution has been in all the nations of the earth. The Axis powers, the instrument of Satan, began open opposition to The Theocratic Government and Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, and with the avowed and announced purpose of said powers to re-establish the old Roman Empire with the Hierarchy of the Vatican riding on the back of that beastly government. The Axis powers defy Jehovah, the Almighty God. Every one who is a supporter of The Theocratic Government suffers at the hands of the Satanic powers. Within the lands controlled by Germany thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses have long lingered in filthy prisons because they have remained steadfast in their devotion to The Theocracy by Christ Jesus. Many of them have been killed because they refused to compromise with Satan’s representatives. They died in faith and faithful, and, without a doubt, the Lord immediately resurrected such and they are now in the Kingdom with Christ Jesus, because such is the promise of Jehovah, and he never fails in one of His promises. (IrCorinthians 15:51-53) There is an abundance of evidence' that in the suffering of those faithful ones Jehovah and Christ Jesus have greatly comforted them. All of these faithful ones rejoice to be counted worthy to suffer for the Kingdom of Righteousness. They hold fast their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Likewise throughout continental Europe, in Asia and Africa, and in the islands of the sea, Jehovah’s witnesses and faithful servants have suffered and still suffer great persecution because of their devotion to The Theocratic Government. In Canada the religious Hierarchy has exercised its influence and persecuting power to such an extent over the political powers as to have declared the witnesses of Almighty God an “illegal organization”. That declaration, however, cannot prevent the faithful servants of Jehovah from continuing God’s work of testifying to the name and. majesty of Almighty God and his government by Christ Jesus. Those faithful men and women count not their lives dear to them, well knowing that if they suffer violence and death at the hand of the enemy because of their faithfulness to The Theocracy God will avenge them and grant them everlasting life in his Kingdom. (Luke 18:7,8) Therefore they go right on serving God and continuing to do so with joyful heart.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>S0</sup> In the United States, for long “the land of the free and the home of the brave”, Jehovah’s witnesses have been subjected to all manner of cruel persecution for no other reason or exctase than that they are faithfully telling the people that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that his government by Christ Jesus is the only hope for humankind. They have been haled into the courts, charged with sedition and treason because of their obedience to the Lord’s command to tell the people the good news that the Theocracy by Christ Jesus is at hand and that early deliverance of the obedient ones is sure. Some of them have had their houses burned and almost all of their property destroyed as the result of hatred by those who are blinded by Satan and who therefore oppose The Theocracy. Verily the prophetic drama of Job is now having fulfillment upon those who stand firm for the Kingdom under Christ Jesus. But, thanks be unto God, we see the end is at hand and the complete triumph of The Theocratic Government is near!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>37</sup> As soon as Jehovah had announced Christ Jesus as King of The Theocracy the Devil began his subtle and vicious attack upon the Kingdom. He persecuted the Lord with unabated viciousness until the body of Jesus hung lifeless on the tree. Satan thought he had defeated The Theocracy ; but he was doomed to disappointment. Jehovah raised Jesus out of death and exalted him to heaven and proceeded in the selection of the members of his Kingdom. In the centuries that followed the resurrection of Christ Jesus Satan has subtly turned millions of professed Christians away from The Theocracy by turning them to religion and inducing them to believe that man can rule the world contrary to Jehovah’s expressed purpose. By means of religion Satan has blinded many to the truth. The result is that today there is but a small number on the earth who stand firm for The Theocracy and which small number the Lord designates as ‘the remnant of the seed of his organization’. Religion has caused the nations called “Christendom” to forget God; and their judgment is written and is certain of execution.—Ps. 9:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> Now the King of The Theocracy is come in power and glory. The demons, with Satan their chief, are cast down to the earth. Their final wicked assault against The Theocracy is in progress, and the host of wickedness go forth to make war upon the remnant of God’s organization, which keep the commandments of God and have and deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Rev. 12:17) Satan knows that the battle of that great day of God Almighty is near, when he must make his last stand. He now fights desperately against those whom Job pictured, and these must hold fast their integrity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>39</sup> The Lord’s “other sheep” have now become the companions of the remnant and join in the proclamation of the name and kingdom of Jehovah. The prophetic book of Job shows that we must expect to Suffer from the assaults of Satan and other demonized creatures on the earth. With full confidence in God and his King the faithful face the situation fully determined that their zeal and activity for The Theocracy shall not be beaten down, but that they shall maintain their integrity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> The apostle Paul, under inspiration of the holy spirit, saw the present-day situation and left behind a message for the comfort and encouragement of the remnant and their companions. He recounts the exaltation of Christ Jesus the King and points to the time when the tongue of every surviving one shall confess that Christ is Lord and King to the glory of God the Father. Now Paul has fully entered into his resurrection glory and his words of admonition thrill his fellow servants yet on earth, who hold fast their integrity. To them the faithful apostle says: “Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” —Phil. 2:12,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> These words assure God’s servants that if they have remained steadfast on the side of The Theocracy they cannot fail. Then the apostle further says: “Do all4hings without murmurings and disputings; that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.” (Phil. 2:14-18) The saints in heaven rejoice and we now on earth do rejoice that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is at hand.—Rev. 7:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> We must now be blameless and harmless as sons of God. We must hold fast our integrity; and this, by God’s grace, we can do by refusing to compromise with any part of the demonized organization of the enemy. We must and will be entirely, wholly, unreservedly and completely devoted to The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. We can have no part in and nothing in common with Satan’s organization. We are wholly and steadfastly for The Theocratic </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Government, and here, by God’s grace, we will remain. We know it shall vindicate Jehovah’s name and bring deliverance to all who love righteousness and who serve Jehovah under his righteous government.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; As David the king, who was a type of The Christ, prayed, so now let all of Jehovah’s witnesses pray: “Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.” (Ps. 25: 21) “Judge me, 0 Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity; I have trusted also in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide. For thy lov-ingkindness is before mine eyes; and I have walked in thy truth. I will wash mine hands in innocency; so will I compass thine altar, 0 Lord: that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.”—Ps. 26:1, 3, 6, 7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>44</sup> Let nothing move you from the absolute and complete devotion to The Theocracy. Be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord ; and, thus doing, you shall receive and enter into everlasting blessings of Jehovah and his King!</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THE WAY TO LIFE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font4">HERE is a way that leads to destruction. There is a way that leads to preservation. The one means eternal death. The others means eternal life. Each intelligent creature, coming to a knowledge of these ways and then choosing, fixes his own destiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He that has the power of death is now making desperate war against him that has the power of life. The worst of the battle seems to be just ahead. Who is on the right side, and who will be able to stand ? Those persons who are in a covenant with the Supreme Being to do His work and will occupy the most critical position of all on the earth. Falling away now from steadfastness may plunge such into everlasting darkness. Steadfastness, fidelity and loyalty to the Lord God now lead to endless life and joy. Blessed is the person on earth now who has a vision of God’s unfolding purpose. Thrice blessed is he that understands, appreciates and joyfully obeys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reason why this crisis has come, the reason why the battle is so desperate and must increase in severity to the end, the reason why those in a covenant with God stand in such danger and at the same time in such transcendant glory, cannot be so well understood and appreciated without a view of the history of Lucifer and The Logos. The two great ways are marked out by the course these mighty ones have taken. God’s intelligent creatures must know this fact and, knowing, must choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lucifer’s name means “Brilliant Star”. God’s prophet (Isaiah 14:12) speaks of him as “Son of the Morning”. It would be difficult to find words more descriptive of beauty than these. Without doubt he was a part of God’s organization. He was in the holy kingdom of Jehovah God, shining forth among the others of that glorious realm. Doubtless he was more brilliant and showy than any others of the creatures of heaven. He was appointed by Jehovah to a high official position in the kingdom of God. This is made certain by the words of God’s prophet (Ezekiel 28. 14) : “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain [kingdom] of God.” The word “covereth” means to screen, to shield, and to protect. “Anointed” means appointed to official position by Jehovah. Therefore his name indicates that Jehovah appointed him for the purpose of screening, shielding and protecting those over whom he had supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That Lucifer was beautiful beyond the description of our language there can be no doubt, and in proof of this the words of Ezekiel 28:13 are cited: “Every precious stone was thy covering.” And this was so from the day that he was created. (Vs. 15) That he was perfect there can be no doubt, because all Jehovah’s works are perfect. —Deut. 32: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning his way from the day of his creation, Ezekiel 28:15 says: “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the course of time God created the perfect man, Adam, and his perfect wife, Eve, and provided them with a perfect home in his garden, Eden. He gave Lucifer charge over this perfect pair to shield and to screen and protect them. That he was there in Eden for that purpose there is not any doubt, because God says of him: “Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God,... thou art the anointed cherub that covereth.”—Verses 13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God gave to Adam His law. He plainly told Adam that a violation of his law would result in the enforcement of the death penalty. (Gen. 2:17) Since Lucifer was given charge over man to shield and protect him, it follows that he-had the power to inflict punishment for any infraction of the rules or laws governing man. He was made Jehovah’s executive officer over man. Then it would seem that it would be his right and duty to put man to death for the violation of God's law. That he was given the power of death there can be no doubt, because the apostle Paul, under inspiration, plainly says of him: ‘‘Him that had </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the power of</span><span class="font4"> death, that is, the devil.”—Heb. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lucifer did not usurp power or authority over man, because God gave him that right. To “usurp” means to seize authority from another, to hold a position by force and without right. A usurper is one who by force seizes, illegally, the sovereign power, or the throne from the rightful holder, and then holds it by force, illegally. That would be a bold, bad deed; but there are some things that are worse. Lucifer did not usurp power and authority from God, because that would mean that he would exercise a force superior to that possessed by Jehovah; which is impossible. He did not usurp power and authority, but did worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He held a position of confidence and trust by appointment from Jehovah. He occupied a fiduciary relationship toward God. A fiduciary is one who holds a thing in trust for another. The position necessarily involves confidence and trust, requiring and demanding faithfulness and loyalty to the last degree. To betray such a trust is far worse than being a usurper. One in such a fiduciary capacity who is guilty of betraying his trust is lawless, wicked and iniquitous. Yea, because of the violation of his sacred obligation he makes himself a nefarious creature and covers himself with perfidy. Not only did Lucifer do this, but to accomplish his selfish purpose he resorted to lying, murder, and defamation of the good name of his great Creatdr, Jehovah, to whom he was indebted for his position </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and for</span><span class="font4"> his life. He became the greatest and most wicked of all criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophet Ezekiel later tells how Lucifer was impressed with his own beauty: “Thine heart was lifted up because of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thy</span><span class="font4"> beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.” (Ezek. 28:17) The prophet Isaiah tells of the conception of Lucifer’s wicked scheme. (Isa 14: 13, 14) His heart was malignant; that is to say, h:s purpose or motive secretly conceived was wicked. This docs not prove he was a usurper of power, but does prove he used the power and authority with which he was clothed for his own selfish gratification. Be it here noted that he has tempted every one of God’s righteous creatures along the same line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chapter three of Genesis records the beginning of Lucifer's wicked scheme. He knew that God had commanded Adam and Eve to multiply and fill the earth with a righteous race and that by their obeying this divine mandate the time would come when the earth would be filled with a race of human creatures. He knew that man worshiped God He also knew that for him to accomplish his own selfish purpose he must alienate man’s affections from God. He determined he would do this very thing by inducing Adam and Eve to believe that God is a liar, that he was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">holding trona them their just rights</span><span class="font4"> by a threat of death, and that God was therefore unworthy of love and worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This perfect pair was already under Lucifer’s care. His purpose was, by betraying his trust, to win the affection and worship of man. Because God had given Lucifer the power of death he would reason that should Adam and Eve turn away from God and be found guilty, it would devolve upon himself, Lucifer, to execute the death penalty under the law, but that he would refuse to do this and in the course of time he would see the earth filled with the offspring of man, and that this creation would worship him instead of God, and that then he would be like the Most High God.—Isa. 14:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To carry out his wicked and diabolical scheme he told Eve that the eating of the forbidden fruit would not result in death. Through the serpent he said: “Ye shall not surely die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” (Gen. 3:4, 5) Intending, doubtless, to refuse to exercise against them the power of death, he expected to see Eve and Adam have the eyes of their understanding opened; that they would still live; that they would then believe God to be a liar and believe Lucifer to be their benefactor, and that therefore they would readily turn from God and worship Lucifer. In order that he might be adored and worshiped like the Most High Ged he was willing to betray his sacred trust, to make God </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">oat a</span><span class="font4"> liar and devoid of love, and he was willing to risk his own ability to save man from death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God knew of this wicked scheme in Satan's heart, of course; and that was when iniquity was found in Lucifer’s heart. Jehovah did not interfere with his carrying out his wicked scheme. To him are directed the words: “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.”(Ezek. 28:15) “Iniquity” means perverseness, wickedness, lawlessness and unrighteousness. It means the violation of the rights of others. It means nefariousness, that is to say, a breach of the most sacred trust and obligation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Error” means to wander away or deviate from the right course; a departing or deviation from truth, a violation of duty. It means lawlessness and sin. It means fraud, deceit and delusion; a turning away from piety or a right course. The error or delusion of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the wicked one was </span><span class="font4">selfishness, which means a lack of love. Of Satan, the prophet (Isaiah 14:13, 14) says: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">throne above the</span><span class="font4"> stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I will be like the</span><span class="font4"> Most High.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lucifer permitted selfishness to override love. Therefore he developed a wicked heart. Pride and a malicious desire to shine above all other creatures and to be like the Most High God led him to unfaithfulness and disloyalty, and that through selfishness. His end is destruction. His course, or way, stands as a monument, warning every intelligent creature that he who goes this way goes to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Writes the apostle John: “In the beginning was the Word [or, The Logos], and the Word [The Logos] was with God.” (John 1:1) The Logos was and is the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font4"> begotten Son of God, “the beginning of the creation of God.” (Rev. 3: 14; Col. 1:15) On the sixth creative day concerning the earth God said: “Let us make man.” (Gen. 1: 26) While no statement is made as to to whom God spoke these words, it seems quite evident that they were addressed to his chief executive officer, The Logos. (John 1:2, 3) Lucifer may have been present and participated in the conversation. This conclusion finds some force in the statement of the prophet (Job 38:7) that when God laid the foundation of the earth “the morning stars sang together”. That The Logos and Lucifer were the “morning stars” here mentioned seems to be definitely settled.—See Isaiah 14:12; Revelation 22:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle John tells us that all things were made by The Logos as Jehovah’s active agent, and that without him was nothing made that was made. (John 1:3) The Logos not only was the confidential friend of Jehovah, but was entrusted by Jehovah with the great work of creation. Of course, this creation must have included the creation of Lucifer. There is no place in the Scriptures that indicates that The Logos sought to shine in the eyes of others. There is nothing to indicate that he ever possessed any selfish spirit. He is shown to be a humble, submissive and faithful messenger of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the children of Israel left Egypt and wandered for forty years in the wilderness on the way to the Promised Land,-God sent an angel before them, as it is written in Exodus 23:20. Doubtless that angel or messenger was The Logos. In the same capacity, as a messenger or angel of Jehovah, The Logos appeared to '.Joshua as the captain of the Lord’s hosts. (Josh. 5:14) And later he is shown as Michael, the friend of God’s people, who stands up for the people.—Dan. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all these things The Logos delighted to do his Father’s will. “Wherefore, when he eometh into the world, he saith,... Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, 0 God.” “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Heb. 10: 5-7; Ps. 40:8) The Logos loved the name and honor of his Father. He was unselfishly devoted to Him. Of course, lie observed the apparent leniency and tolerance of God toward Satan, in that God permitted him without interference until the end of the world to pursue his nefarious course, and this of itself would furnish a test to the loyalty of The Logos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God made his purpose of salvation of humankind to depend upon the vindication of His name by the perfect loyalty and absolute devotion of The Logos when made a perfect man on earth. To others it would seem weakness to risk so much upon the faithfulness and integrity of one perfect man, but “the weakness of God is stronger than men”. (1 Cor. 1:25) The Logos being tested for a period of four thousand years after the treachery of Lucifer and always loyal and unselfishly devoted to the Father, God knew he could safely rely upon his only begotten Son when he would be transferred to earth as a man, to become the vindicator of Jehovah’s word and name and also the Redeemer of obedient humankind. There could never be such an exhibition of fidelity, submissiveness, loyalty and unselfish devotion to Jehovah God as that made manifest by the Logos, afterwards Jesus, later the Christ or Anointed One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When on earth Jesus was always faithful and loyal to his Father. He refused to be tempted away from his course of steadfastness, defending himself against every assault through the Word of God. He said: “I can of mine own self do nothing:... because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.” (John 5:30) He and his Father, having enjoyed long centuries of sweet fellowship, knew each other and loved each other. Jesus said: “As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.”—John 10:15, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus knew it was the will of God to have him suffer death that he might vindicate his Father’s name and redeem man and undo and destroy the wicked works of the evil one; and such was the joy this brought to him that he gladly and willingly did it, despising the shame to which he was subjected. (Heb. 12:2) Instead of attempting to make himself a reputation and to shine in the eyes of others, he humbled himself and became obedient even unto the most ignominious death. For this reason God has highly exalted him and given him a name above every name, and commands that all creatures in heaven and earth shall worship the Son as he worships the Father.—Phil. 2: 5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lucifer had selfishly attempted to obtain the worship of creatures, and resorted to the blackest crime to accomplish his purpose; and he must therefore suffer destruction. The Logos always honored his Father, defending His good name and fame, and willingly went to an ignominious death to accomplish his Father’s will; and the Father will see to it that all creation shall worship the Son. The Logos justly earned and received the title “The Faithful and True”. (Rev. 19:11-13) His course of humility, loving devotion, absolute and complete faithfulness and unswerving loyalty has led him to the highest place; and his honor shall never be dimmed. The course of The Logos, like a silent monument, stands beckoning all creatures that desire life to walk that way. Said Jesus: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font4"> am the way, and the truth, and the life.”—John 14: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the end of Satan is to be destruction there is no doubt. That his destruction is being deferred until his wicked works are destroyed at the battle of Armageddon is also sure. (1 John 3:8) In pronouncing judgment against Lucifer Jehovah said: “I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain [kingdom] of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.... I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee.... And never shalt thou be any more.”—Ezek. 28:16, 18, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of the tragedy in Eden there were no nations on earth. But, looking down to the end, God said in prophetic phrase to Lucifer: “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!” (Isa. 14:12) These words of final judgment pronounced against the wicked one seem clearly to refer to the future, both by reason of the phrase used and by the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since Eden Sat^n has been permitted to pursue his wicked course, all of which God will counteract in his own due time to his own glory. Thereafter when the sons of God came to present themselves to Jehovah, Satan also came and even had the liberty of holding conversation with God concerning man. (See Job 1:6-8; 2:1-7.) The prophet Zechariah gives testimony to the fact that while the “church of the living God” has been in course of selection and development, Satan has been standing by to resist. (Zech. 3:1-3) Moses, the servant of Jehovah, was permitted to see the land of Canaan from a mountaintop, but was not permitted to cross the Jordan river and go into it. Moses died in the mountain. It seems evident, according to the record of Jude 9, that Satan then possessed the power of death, because he claimed the right to the body of Moses. Michael seems to have recognized that Satan still had some authority and official power, because, as recorded, he contended with the Devil about the body of Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus was on the earth Satan boldly claimed that the world belonged to him and that he had the right to give it to Jesus, only upon condition that Jesus would fall down and worship him. He, at that time, still possessed the great desire to be worshiped like as Jehovah is worshiped. Jesus did not deny Satan’s claim to ownership of the world. (Luke 4:6, 7)-On the contrary, Jesus spoke of Satan as “the prince of this world”.—John 12: 31; 14: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That Satan has had access to heaven, and the privilege of communication with Jehovah until the establishment of God’s kingdom in 1914, seems quite evident from the fact that till the enthronement of Christ Jesus as King Satan has been the accuser of the brethren of Christ day and night before Jehovah God. (Rev. 12:10) That Satan possessed the power of death during the apostle Paul’s time seems to be indicated by his words concerning the wicked: “Deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit [of the Lord in the church] may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.” (1 Cor. 5:5) “Of whom is Hymenasus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.”— 1 Tim. 1: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan, all through the centuries, has held to the claim that he had a right to destroy those who will destroy him. In Eden Jehovah said to Satan under the symbol of the serpent: “Arid I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”—Gen. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan observed that Abel pleased God, hence he proceeded to cause Abel’s destruction. He has tried to destroy all those who have sought after and served God. He caused the prophets of God to be imprisoned, sawn asunder, and slain. God could have prevented this, but for his own good reasons he did not do so. In due time Jehovah will demonstrate his great power by resurrection to bring forth to life everlasting those who proved their faithfulness and who suffered martyrdom at the hands of Satan and his emissaries. Satan has at all times sought to destroy the “seed” of promise; that is to say, The Christ, to wit, Jesus the Head and the church his body. That Satan has often prevented the Christians from doing what they wanted to do, seems evident from the apostle’s words: “Satan hindered us.”—1 Thess. 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us keep in mind the course of selfishness pursued by Satan, and his end; and, above all, let us keep in mind the course pursued by the Lord, and his glorious reward. “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.”—Heb. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God is love. Jesus is the “express image” of his Father; therefore Christ Jesus is the perfect expression of unselfishness. His is the way that leads to life.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WHOSE PRAYERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">ORLD peace is the burden of countless prayers by the religionists during the present international crisis. Many of the peoples of earth address their</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">prayers to stones or to statues of wood or to other inanimate objects. Some turn wheels and count that as prayer, while others count beads and repeat formal phrases and believe that this is prayer to God. Such prayers are worse than useless. They are never answered. Many prostrate themselves in an attitude of devotion before images of wood or stone, or before some inanimate object in the form of a cross, believing that the presence of such object will aid them in their prayers. The people who offer these prayers are not to be blamed. It is religion that is blameworthy! Such prayers are without proper understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not all persons have the privilege of approaching in prayer unto the great Giver of every good and perfect gift? They have not. People may pray but with no assurance of having their prayers answered. Under inspiration from God the apostle Peter wrote: “For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.” (1 Pet. 3:12) By this authority it is seen that only the righteous have the privilege of prayer. Such may</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark13"></a>ARE ANSWERED?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">present their petitions to God and expect to be heard and answered according to His holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Does not the sinner have the privilege of prayer? If one who is a sinner, going in the way of sin, repents and is converted, which means to change his mind and his course of action, and then desires the mercy of God, he may call upon God for mercy; and if he follows God’s appointed way he may come into harmony with God and later enjoy the privilege of prayer. An example of a sinner praying to God is found in the Scriptures, at Luke 18: 13: “And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.” It will be observed, however, that he had not the full privilege of prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Can a Mohammedan or other heathen pray to God and expect relief? The answer is, No; because such religionists do not proceed according to God’s appointed way. They do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the great Redeemer of man and the way of coming to God. Why is it necessary to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Redeemer? Because all the human family became sinners by reason of the first man’s disobedience to God. Jehovah God provided for the death of his beloved Son that through the merit of that sacrifice those of Adam’s offspring who believe and obey might be relieved of the effects of the judgment of condemnation. God does not force this privilege upon anyone, but grants it to those who come and ask, as sinners, that they might be relieved of their difficulties and come into harmony with him through Christ Jesus. It follows, then, that if anyone comes in any other way than through Christ he would not be received. Hence prayers to a dead woman (Mary) for world peace and other favors are of no value. The Scriptures leave no doubt about this. The apostle Peter says, at Acts 4:10-12: “By the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.... Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What, then, shall we say about “modernists”? Modernist clergymen in particular say they do not believe man fell because of sin, nor do they believe God created man, but claim that man is a creature of evolution and that man is gradually evolving. They say they do not believe the blood of Jesus was shed as a redemptive price for man; hence they do not have faith in the ransom sacrifice. These modernists often stand in public places and pray. Do they have the privilege of prayer, or are their prayers heard? This can be judged only by the Scriptures; and when the Scriptures plainly say that no man can come unto God except through Christ Jesus, then it follows conclusively that any man who believes neither in the fall of Adam nor in the redemptive price, and hence denies Christ Jesus as the great Redeemer and King, has no privilege of prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Jesus’ day the ecclesiastical </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font4"> clergy element, particularly the scribes and the Pharisees, who claimed to represent God, took much pleasure in walking on the streets in long robes and in appearing in the religious houses in such and receiving greetings, and in occupying the chief rooms at the feasts. They also delighted to display their piety by standing in the synagogues and on the street corners in prayer. Jesus said that these were hypocrites, that they were praying to be seen of men, and that they had their reward, because men might see them and say: How wonderfully pious are these men <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After 1900 years this class of religious clergymen have not passed from the earth, but rather have increased in numbers and have fraudulently taken to themselves the name “Christian”. The words of Jesus (Luke 20:46, 47) seem now quite appropriate: “Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; which devour widows’ houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater [condemnation].” And Matthew 6:5: “And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a time and a place for everything. God does not judge one according to the place where he prays, but judges him according to his purpose and intent. If his prayer is uttered in a public place that others might hear and remark upon the piety of the one praying, then such a one may receive the reward of commendation of others, but he does not receive the approval of God There are certain conditions in which it would be proper to pray in public. Where there is a public assembly of Christian people for the purpose of holding public worship it would be entirely appropriate for the chairman, or other consecrated Christian in the presence of all, to act as the spokesman to give expression of thanksgiving to God for his manifold blessings and to ask his guidance in the consideration of the matters in which the assembly is to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should be remembered always that prayer is not offered to the people, but to Jehovah God. Only God can grant the answer to prayer. If, therefore, there is a thing in which a public assembly of those in a covenant with God is equally and jointly interested, and if all desire to ask the same thing, it would be proper then for one to utter audibly the prayer that the minds of all might be guided in unison. Where there is a mixed audience, or many present that do not believe the Lord, then if the one serving desires to pray it would be far better for him and more in keeping with the Scriptures if he should pray privately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Thanksgiving” means to give expression of gratitude for favors and blessings received. It is proper for all people to express their gratitude to the Giver of every good and perfect gift. For a chairman of a public assembly, however, to stand up before the people and tell Jehovah God what He is expected to do, is not only presumptuous but often blasphemous. Long prayers uttered in the presence of others are generally uttered for the purpose of attracting attention to the speaker. We may be sure that Jehovah does not hear and answer such prayers. Ofttimes the chairman prays because he loves to hear his own voice and that others might comment upon his eloquence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jesus left no doubt as to where the Christian should pray. He said: “But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.” (Matt. 6 6) If you desire a special favor at the hands of some earthly ruler, you would not wish to call a public assembly of the people and loudly announce in their presence your requests addressed to the ruler. You would prefer to have a secret audience with him, that you might present your matter in a better and more direct way. Since prayers are addressed to Jehovah, the effectual prayer is that petition which is secretly presented to Jehovah God in Jesus’ name</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was not unusual for the Lord Jesus to withdiaw to a secret place for prayer. He did not utter prayers for the benefit of the multitude, that they might hear him. Concerning this it is written, at Matthew 14 • 23: “And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.” He held sweet and precious communion with his Father in heaven by means of prayer This is true of each true and faithful follower of the Lord Jesus. To all such prayer is a sacred privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If it becomes necessary or fitting to pray in public, no one that is a true Christian would hesitate to do this. The point is that it seems more appropriate for a child of God who has a petition to present to his Father to do so secretly, or else in company with others of like precious faith, that the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font4">d of each one may be solemnly set upon the thing that they ask in the name of the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is there any virtue in a long prayer? Or might we expect the Lord to surely hear and answer our prayer if we repeated it time and time again ? Many good, honest people are told that if they will repeat their prayers so many times a day, and count the number by going over their beads, this will result to them in many blessings. Undoubtedly they are honest in their endeavors, but the trouble is that they are not advised as to what the teaching of the Scriptures is upon the point. Jesus, when instructing his disciples to pray, said: “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.”—Matt. 6: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not necessary to tell the all-wise Creator time and time again our heart’s desire. As the Lord here stated, our Father knows&quot; in advance what things we have need of. The question may then arise, Why ask him at all if he knows in advance what we need? The answer to that is this: Jehovah is a just, wise and loving God. He does not force anything upon another. He wishes his children to learn certain truths and to express themselves in full harmony with his will, and to earnestly desire his blessings before he bestows them. Any good parent can see the wisdom of this course. If he wishes to properly train his child “in the nurtute and admonition of’the Lord” (Eph. 6:4), he will prefer to see the child first request a thing that is desired; then, if his wisdom leads him to believe the child is in need of it, he takes delight in giving it. Jesus lays down the rule when he says: “And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.”—Luke 11: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through the prophet Moses the Israelites were brought into a covenant or solemn contract with God, and they prayed to God because they were his covenant people and servants of God under the terms of the law covenant. By Christ Jesus the Christian is directed to pray to Jehovah God and to address him as Father. Only those who are His sons begotten of his spirit, or who are in line to become his earthly children under the Kingdom, have this privilege to thus address Him. All such are likewise in a covenant with Jehovah God by a consecration of themselves to Him by Christ Jesus to do God’s will. At John 15:16 the Lord Jesus lays down the rule definitely that the petition must be presented in his name: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.” At John 14:6 he said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This fixes the rule, then, as to who can come to God and to whom the Christian must present his petition- or prayer. Necessarily it excludes unbelievers and also those who claim to be Christians but who deny God’s Word and who oppose his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, by which Government He will vindicate His name and bless obedient humankind. It cannot be said that because a man poses before the public as a clergyman, priest or preacher he has the privilege of praying to God. When the Lord Jesus was on earth the scribes and the Pharisees were the most zealous of all in claiming to represent God. Without doubt their prayers were not heard by Jehovah, for the reason that Jesus said to them: “If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8:42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jesus himself directs the Christian that when he prays he should say to Jehovah God: “Our Father which art in heaven”; and that then he should ask in the name of Jesus, the Son of Jehovah. He says: “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” (John 15:7) If one abides in that blessed condition and with the Word of God abiding in him, then he shall ask what he will and it shall be done to him. But mark the condition: If the Word of God abides in him, then the Christian will ask only in harmony with the will of God and not ask something formulated by religion and contrary to God’s expressed will. As Jesus stated, at John 14:13, 14: “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.” By this text, then, it is seen to be proper for the child of God to address his prayer to Jehovah, the Father, and in the name of the Son, Christ Jesus, and according to the written Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today true Christians, as Jehovah’s witnesses, suffer great persecution and they cry in prayer to Jehovah God for his name’s sake. Looking forward to this very day Jesus said: “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith [this belief] on the earth?” (Luke 18:7, 8) Who on earth today has this strong and abiding faith ? Who understands the meaning of these trying times, particularly the great persecution of those who serve Jehovah God and Christ? Do you believe that Jehovah will by Christ Jesus within a very short time avenge his elect and thus vindicate his own great and holy name? “According to your faith be it unto you.” (Matt. 9:29) Be assured that all things shall work together for your good because you love God and have been called according to his purpose, and that, come what may, the final result will be glorious to those who stand firm on the side of His great Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Unto such faithful ones the assurance is given that God will answer their prayer and avenge his people, and that shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LONDON ZONE ASSEMBLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Last February a brief announcement appeared that London could expect its zone assembly to take place on Sunday, May 18. At the time of the announcement the whole country was in heated controversy regarding the opening of all theaters on Sundays. Military speakers were all in favor, as thousands of soldiers are at a loss as to what to do with their Sunday evenings. Week after week the battle waged. With it the fate of our assembly seemed closely allied. Eventually the motion was defeated in the House of Commons by a margin of three votes. Immediately we got busy. The Wimbledon Theater in South London was selected and arrangements fixed except that we found it necessary to forward the date to May 11, as the theater was going over to movies with the subsequent Sunday opening. The brethren had the first official announcements at their local Kingdom Halls. Each unit was advised to make its own arrangements for hiring buses or coaches to overcome the wartime difficulties of travel. Back-calls were visited; people of good-will were given invitation tickets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was decided to make the assembly a two-day affair, commencing with a two-mile ‘magazine pavement witness’ right through the heart of the West End of London. Pioneers and any interested could attend the servants’ meeting afterwards, both of these events to take place on the Saturday. It was decided to hold field service on Sunday morning, having the brethren meet at four rallying points, Paddington, Wimbledon, Brixton, and Teddington, at 9:30 a. m. and to leave for the field after song and prayer, back at the assembly points at one o’clock for sandwiches, and then to Wimbledon, where proceedings were due to commence at 4 p. m. All four points were Kingdom Halls; tea was to be provided at each point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Came the day, Saturday, May 10, time 2 p. m. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> bags everywhere. From all parts of London they came. Arrived at the headquarters the brethren were dispatched in parties to take up their allotted positions along the planned route: Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street, and Edgeware Road. Four miles of ‘magazine pavement witnessing’! At four o’clock back to the Central Kingdom Hall for the servants’ meeting; 700 brethren in attendance. Here we discussed Kingdom interests as concerning London. The Society’s London Branch servant gave us counsel and quoted instances of the growth of demonism in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Nightfall, with a brilliant full moon; time, 11:30 p. m. All Jehovah’s witnesses tucked up in bed resting content in the Lord and ready for the morrow. Suddenly the night air is rent with the stomach-turning air-raid warning, a sound which only the Devil himself could think of. Almost immediately the sound of many planes and gunfire. From that time till 6 a. m. wave after wave of Nazi bombers carried out a most violent and concentrated ‘blitz’ on the center of London and along the route where we had stood the afternoon before. Great fires were started and intense damage done. Railways were put out of action, and the Devil was reigning again in his confusion. The boys in the Society’s Bethel home were rocked all night long in their beds by the bombs crashing all around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Came the morning of Sunday, May 11. Early reports showed chaos on the public transport facilities. Then was seen the blessing of having made all arrangements to come to the rally in private hire coaches. The coachloads of happy witnesses began to converge at the four points. Most of them had little sleep, but that did not matter. One, a Greek pioneer, turned up at the Central unit with only his trousers and jacket. During the ‘blitz’ he took refuge in a shelter. He returned home only to find it had vanished, having received a direct hit. Smiling, he was the first to turn up at his rally point, where he was provided with a shirt and in an hour’s time was leading a party of thirty out onto the field. All the coaches arrived, and by 10:30 all brethren were in the field. Again the cloud of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> bags descended on London ■ as one cockney spectator remarked: ‘Blimey, there’s fousands of ’em!’ The field report showed actually 1,060 in the service Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The report came that the ffilitz’ had deprived two rally points of gas, hence tea-making difficulties. Insurmountable difficulty! Oh, no! Fires were built in gardens and basements, and water boiled in dixies in the good ‘old-fashioned’ ‘out West’ style. One watchman minding a bomb crater in the South district lent his brazier for kettle boiling. One o’clock and all returned, brimful of field experiences. The physical man was fed while music and declarations were in progress from the platforms. Plenty of tales to tell! Two-thirty p.m., back into the coaches and the long, long trail to Wimbledon: ‘all steps to Wimbledon today, sir E Puzzled onlookers who overcame their curiosity by asking ‘the reason of the hope that is within you’ were rewarded by a personal witness and the offer of a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription. One subscription was placed within </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">three minutes of </span><span class="font4">the signal given for the departure. Right through the London streets the cavalcade passed, diverted </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">where </span><span class="font4">bombed streets made it impassable. Each coach had all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> bags well in evidence and a sign </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘London Theocratic Assembly’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Arrival at Wimbledon! Clouds of locusts’—2,200 of them. Main street full of coaches and buses. Police most helpful. Remarks from the public, ‘Who are all these people?’ ‘What have they got to laugh at anyway?’ ‘What’s this Theocratic Government?’ Whenever the last remark was made within hearing of a ‘locust’, the answer and a witness was immediately forthcoming. Inside the theater, sharp at 4 p.m. the assembly began. Keynote of all proceedings was the Victory Song [Judges chapter 5]. The stage was dominated by a huge, colored photographic enlargement of the cover of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy.</span><span class="font4"> Each speaker carried the theme of the Victory Song. The Jael class were invited to join with us in driving home ‘the hammer and the nail’, A demonstration was given showing how not to witness and the correct method. A great item, and we all enjoyed a laugh at our own expense. A high spot of the program was reached when some thirty newly interested, many of whom had made their first approach to the doors of the people that morning, were introduced to the audience and gave declarations. The assembly closed with a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, thrown open to the audience of 2,000. Then everyone climbed back into the coaches.”</span></p>
