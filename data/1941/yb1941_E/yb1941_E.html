<p><span class="font1">1941 YEARBOOK </span><span class="font6">of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S GOVERNMENT of the world by Christ Jesus, His King and Executive Officer, is The Theocracy. No human eye will ever behold Jehovah God, because he is spirit. Christ Jesus, the King, is the “express image” of Jehovah, the Most High, and is likewise for ever invisible to human eyes. Christ Jesus is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and carries out the orders of Almighty God. Concerning this it is written in the Scriptures: “Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see; to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.” —1 Tim. 6: 15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For centuries Jehovah, the Almighty God, communicated to his people through his holy prophets, whom he commissioned and inspired to speak his truth. Then he sent his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, to speak for him and to execute his purposes in the earth: “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.” (Heb. 1: 1-4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unto Jesus the Almighty has committed “all power ... in heaven and in earth”, and given him authority to execute such power. (Matt. 28:18) Christ Jesus was anointed as King at the time he was immersed in the Jordan river. He was anointed by the spirit of Jehovah. (Matt. 3: 16,17) To Christ Jesus, the King, was then committed the judgment of the world and of men: “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.”—John 5: 22, 27.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>AUTHORITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Holy Scriptures, contained in the book known as The Bible, were written by men entirely devoted to Almighty God, and which men were inspired and moved by the spirit of Almighty God to record what is there written: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy ghost [holy spirit (S.V.)].” (2 Pet. 1:21) “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness ; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”—2 Tim. 3: 16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “man of God” is any man who sincerely desires to know God and to be obedient to God's commandments and who is then diligent to learn his commandments and to honor the name of the Most High by being diligent in obedience to his commandments to make known the name and the kingdom of Jehovah. To such a man the Bible, which is God’s Word of truth, is a perfect and sure guide; and therefore in the language of the psalmist he says: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” —Ps. 119: 105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the man who is diligent to learn and to go in the right way the Almighty God says: “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.” (Ps. 25: 9) “I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thon shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.” (Ps. 32: 8) “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” (Prov. 3: 5, 6) To such devoted person God makes it possible for him to have an understanding of the Scriptures, and these scriptures thoroughly equip such man to be the servant of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Word of Almighty God is always right and true: “For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth.” (Ps. 33: 4) The “man of God” desires at all times the truth. For that reason the Holy Scriptures, set out in The Bible, constitute the authority here cited and which shows the reason for the existence and the work of Jehovah's witnesses. This testimony is here set out in order that all persons who desire to know him have an opportunity to understand why a certain class of persons now on the earth are designated as “Jehovah’s witnesses” and why such persons are engaged in a specific work at this time and are opposed so vigorously by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “man of God” continuously has this prayer in his heart: ‘Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, 0 Lord; let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me.” (Ps. 40:11) Thus praying, he diligently puts forth an endeavor to know the truth and serve the truth. Truth never fails, and in due time must triumph. “For the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.” (Ps. 100: 5) “Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth. Thou art near, 0 Lord; and all thy commandments are truth.”—Ps. 119:142,151.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>THE FATHER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Supreme One is God, who is the Almighty. He is the Father, hence the Life-giver to all who receive life and the right to life. To Abraham God said: “I am the Almighty God.” (Gen. 17:1) &quot;From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” (Ps. 90: 2) The name Jehovah belongs to the Almighty God and to none other, and therefore it is written: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.” (Ps. 83: 18) Being the Most High and the Almighty, there resides in him supreme power. His will is the perfect law by which the man of God must be guided, and, if he is thus guided, in due time he shall receive life everlasting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>THE SON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus is the Son of the Almighty God. There are others who are called “gods”, or mighty ones, but to those who love righteousness there is but one Almighty God; as it is written: “But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.” (1 Cor. 8: 6) Jehovah is the Father of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. (2 Cor. 11: 31) Jesus is the beloved and only begotten Son of the Almighty God, whom the Almighty, the Father, sent to earth to represent him and to declare his truth. (John 3: 16,17) Because of complete obedience of Jesus, the Son, in carrying out the will of his Father, Jehovah, he, the Lord Jesus, is commissioned and honored and exalted by Jehovah God above all and next to the Father himself: “Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”—Ps. 45: 7.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>UNITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Almighty God Jehovah is the Creator of heaven and earth, and all things of the earth and of heaven rightfully belong to him. (Ps. 24: 1) His throne of authority is in heaven. Thus saith Jehovah: “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.” (Isa. 66:1) He is without beginning and without end. He is the “I AM”; that is to say, he was not from some time past, but his existence is without reference to time: &quot;And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.” —Ex 3: 13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is the Life-giver, or Father, to all those who love righteousness. He is the Giver of every good and perfect gift: “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” (Jas. 1:17) Every creature, whether spirit or human, that lives everlastingly, must receive his life and right to life from the Almighty, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Son of God, Christ Jesus, was from the beginning known by the name Logos (according to the Greek). He is The beginning of God’s creation’, and thereafter everything that was made was made by Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus. (John 1: 1-3; Rev. 3:14) He is the official representative of Jehovah, the Most High, and the one who carries into action Jehovah’s purposes. God, the Father, sent his beloved Son to earth to here perform his purposes. He was made flesh and dwelt amongst men: “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” (John 1:14) The man Jesus bore testimony before others, saying this: “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.” (John 4: 34) “But I have greater witness than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.” (John 5: 36) “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.” (John 6: 38-40) “I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; .because I seek not mine awn will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.” (John 5: 30) Thus is shown complete unity of the Father and of the Son, that is to say, oneness or unity in the accomplishment of the purpose of Almighty God. Therefore Jesus said: “I and my Father are one.” (John 10: 30) The Father and the Son are not &quot;one in person”, but are in full and complete unity and harmony of action This is further shown by the scripture, to wit: “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6: 23) Jehovah God is the Life-giver, and that life thus given is administered by his beloved Son, Christ Jesus: <sup>&lt;c</sup>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”—1 Tim. 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS COMMISSION</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5">The commission of Jesus is his authority, received from his Father Jehovah, to do and perform the will of the Almighty God. The commission of Jesus is his authority to act, and includes (1) the vindication of his Father’s name; (2) the redemption and deliverance of those of mankind who believe on God and Christ, and who are obedient to God’s will; and (3) to set up the kingdom of Almighty God by and through which he accomplishes and completes his commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name of Jehovah God is glorious above all creation. For many centuries before the coming of Jesus to earth the Devil had reproached the name of Jehovah, the Most High God, and had caused many creatures to blaspheme Jehovah’s name. The Devil had challenged Jehovah to put any creature on earth who would not blaspheme and reproach God’s name. To the Devil Jehovah therefore said: ‘For this cause have I permitted thee to remain; to shew thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.’ (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> “O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, 0 Lord, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.”—Ps. 74: 10,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The vengeance of God upon his enemies results in the complete vindication of God’s holy name, demonstrating to all that Jehovah is the Almighty; that justice is the foundation of his throne; that he is perfect in wisdom and that he is holy, unselfish, and therefore God is love. To Almighty God belongs vengeance or vindication: &quot;To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. Rejoice, 0 ye nations, with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.” —Dent. 32: 35,41, 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the will of Almighty God that his holy name shall be exalted and that every creature that breathes shall in due time praise the name of the Most High: “Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.” (Ps. 150: 6) “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.”—Ps. 46: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have blasphemed and reproached Jehovah’s name shall be brought low, but the name of Jehovah shall be exalted. (Isa. 2:11,17) Such is the purpose and will of Jehovah, the Almighty God, which purpose will be carried out in due time and executed by the Beloved Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Son Jesus came to do the will of his Father who sent him, and therefore the Beloved Son says: “Then said I, Lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40: 7, 8) Concerning him it is further written: “Wherefore, when he eometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me. In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure: then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, 0 God. Above, when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, 0 God.” (Heb. 10:5-9) Christ Jesus will carry out his commission and will fully vindicate his Father’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a secondary purpose, as provided in his commission of authority, Jesus was sent by his Father to purchase and deliver obedient men from death. Upon all men fell condemnation of death by reason of the sin of the first man; and by the obedience of Christ Jesus in the performance of his Father’s will the way of redemption, deliverance and blessing is opened to mankind. (Rom. 5:12,18,19; John 3:16,17) It is by the kingdom of God, which is The Theocracy, that the purpose of Jehovah God shall be accomplished by and through Christ Jesus, his Executive Officer. It is the man Christ Jesus who by his own lifeblood furnishes the purchase price for the human race. It is the resurrected spirit, Christ Jesus, who saves and delivers from death all of the human race that believe on and obey him and his Father, Jehovah. To accomplish this ransom or redemption of men Jesus must die as a man and be resurrected as a spirit, and then carry out the purpose of Jehovah. He was therefore put to death as a man, and God raised Jesus out of death a spirit creature who lives for evermore. (1 Pet. 3:18; Acts 2:26,36) After his resurrection and ascension into heaven Christ Jesus spoke to his servant John these words: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.”—Rev. 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before Christ Jesus could set up the Kingdom and reign as King, and before he could vindicate his Father’s name, he must first die and be raised out of death, then receive his kingdom, and in his Father’s due time begin the reign as King. Therefore Jesus said to his disciples: “In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself ; that where I am, there ye may be also.” (John 14.2,3) Furthermore to his disciples he said: “Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.” (Luke 22:28,29) Concerning the man Jesus and his death, resurrection and exaltation it is written: “But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”— Phil. 2:7-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When he ascended on high he did not immediately begin his reign, but must wait until God’s due time for him to take his great power and reign; therefore it is written: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Ps. 110:1; Heb. 10:12,13) A long period of time must elapse and has elapsed from the time of the resurrection and ascension of Christ Jesus into heaven and until his coming and the beginning of his reign as King of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>HIS TESTIMONY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The man Jesus when on earth must give testimony to those who would hear of and concerning the great fundamental truths set out in the foregoing Scriptural quotations. He must make known the purpose of his coming to earth as a man. To the governor then acting in Palestine Jesus said: ‘I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I might bear testimony to the truth; and everyone who is of the truth heareth my voice? (John 18:37) At the same time he stated: &quot;My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence.” (John 18:36) It therefore follows that “this world” must come to an end before The Theocratic Government could be put into operation. The commission of Jesus, therefore, required him while on earth to be a witness to the truth and to testify to the truth according to his Father’s will, that those who desire to hear might learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Disciples” means those who are willing learners. The testimony of Jesus was received by the faithful disciples, whom he thereafter appointed and commissioned as his apostles and witnesses. He sent them forth and commanded and commissioned them to bear testimony to the people and to instruct the people that Jehovah is the Almighty God; that Christ Jesus is the beloved Son of Jehovah God; that by the blood of the obedient Son, Christ Jesus, the human race is purchased and redeemed and delivered; that the name of Jehovah God must be and shall be vindicated; and that at the second coming of Christ Jesus all of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">this </span><span class="font5">would be accomplished by and through the Kingdom, or The Theocracy. Therefore he taught his apostles, and all of his followers, to look for the coming and the establishment of The Theocratic Government and to always pray to Jehovah for the coming of that Kingdom.—Matt. 6:10.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>TESTIMONY OF THE APOSTLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">From the time of the ascension of Christ Jesus into heaven to the end of his earthly existence the faithful apostles were taught by him, and from that time, as long as the apostles were on earth, they gave testimony before the people of and concerning the purpose of Jehovah, which in due time shall be accomplished by and through Christ Jesus the King. In all the testimony of those faithful apostles the fact of the coming of Christ Jesus to his kingdom was emphasized. Some of the testimony concerning his coming and his kingdom is as follows: 'We, however, are free citizens of heaven, and we are waiting with longing expectation for the coming from heaven of a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, in the exercise of the power which He has even to subject all things to Himself, will transform this body of our humiliation until it resembles the body of His glory.’ (Phil. 3:20,21, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth; Am. Rev. Ver.) “I</span><span class="font5"> charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom.”—2 Tim. 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That all faithful followers of Christ Jesus must continue to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and to his Theocratic Government this further admonition was given to them, as it is written: “Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”—2 Tim. 4: 2-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To all of his obedient followers Christ Jesus gives this admonition: “Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man eometh.” (Matt. 24: 42,44) From the days of the apostles up to this very hour there have been a small number of faithful men and women who at all times have been diligent in their endeavors to live and to act in harmony with the foregoing admonition, that is, to bear testimony to others of Jehovah God, of Christ his King, and of the Kingdom. These have earnestly waited and looked and prayed for the coming of Christ and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>CORPORATIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">These are days in which corporations are organized and operated to perpetuate title to personal and real property and to carry out a fixed purpose of men, without reference to the duration of life of men. Corporations are organized and employed by followers of Christ Jesus for the purpose aforementioned. In 1884 a corporation was created and organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania under the name and title of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society, the name of which corporation was later changed to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The purpose of that corporation, as stated in its charter, is as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The purpose for which the corporation is formed is, the dissemination of Bible truths in various languages by means of the publication of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and by the use of all other lawful means which its Board of Directors, duly constituted, shall deem expedient for the furtherance of the purpose stated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1908 it was deemed advisable to have a corporation in New York state, and therefore the Peoples Pulpit Association was created and organized under the laws of the State of New York, the name of which corporation has since been changed to Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated. The purpose of this charter is identical with that of the Pennsylvania corporation, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1914 a like corporation was created and organized under the laws of Great Britain under the name and title of International Bible Students Association, and the purpose of that corporation is identical with that of the other two above mentioned. All three of these corporations are one, in this, that they are dedicated to the same use and work. Together they act as printers and manufacturers of books, magazines and other literature for that body of Christian people throughout the earth who are witnesses of Jehovah God and his kingdom. Such witnesses are the followers of Christ Jesus and, in obedience to his commandments and by his authority and commission from Jehovah God, they preach or proclaim the gospel of The Theocracy and hence are</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Charles Taze Russell was the prime mover in the formation and organization of the three corporations above named. Of course, other persons, as the law of the land requires, joined with him in the formation of such corporations. Charles T. Russell, better known as Pastor Russell, was and is a Christian, following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus and fully devoted to Jehovah God. On October 31, 1916, he finished his earthly course. He was faithful unto death in his devotion to God and to His kingdom. He devoted his all to the service of God and Christ. He was loved by all persons knowing him, who loved and served Jehovah God, and was hated by those who were unfaithful to God and who hate God and his kingdom. Like other faithful Christians, he was hated for the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some persons who do not understand, and also others who are enemies of the kingdom of God, claim and state that the body of Christians known and designated as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font5"> now on the earth have in recent years ignored their founder, Pastor Russell, and have formed a cult or sect and have named themselves Jehovah’s witnesses. That conclusion and statement so published by the aforementioned persons is without truth and fact, being wholly false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A “cult” is a system of religious belief, ceremonies and practices indulged in and practiced by an organized body of persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A “sect” is a religious organization of persons who follow a particular leader in their belief and practice of a specific religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Blasphemy” consists of an indignity offered to Almighty God in words, in writing or in signs. The act of claiming the prerogative of God and that which belongs alone to Almighty God, Jehovah, is blasphemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Religion” is doing anything contrary to the will of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christianity” means to joyfully do the will of Almighty God as He has commanded; and because the Lord Jesus Christ always does the will of God gladly, all his followers are properly called “Christians”. These definitions are proper and correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pastor Russell was the general organizer of the three corporations above named, but he was not in any sense the founder or organizer of Jehovah’s witnesses. Pastor Russell was a Christian. The claim that any man is the founder or organizer of Jehovah’s witnesses is blasphemy, for the obvious reason that it is the prerogative solely of Jehovah God to select and organize his own witnesses and that no man has any authority whatsoever to select or organize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses could not be a cult or sect of religionists, because Jehovah God expressly denounces religion as a snare of the Devil, employed to deceive and to entrap men and to turn them away from God. —Deut. 7:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religion originated with the Devil and has been used by the Devil at all times since to deceive the people and to turn them away from the worship of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who, then, are Jehovah's witnesses? and by whom are they selected and organized to perform their duties and carry on their work ? They are made up of persons who are entirely devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom and who are diligent and faithful in carrying out his orders as commanded by the Most High. They are selected or chosen by Almighty Jehovah God. No man could select them. Concerning such it is written: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.” —1 Pet. 2:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief witness of Jehovah God, the Head over all of his witnesses, is the Logos, Christ Jesus, the Lord, Savior, and King of The Theocracy. One of his official titles is “The Faithful and True Witness”. —Rev. 1: 5 ; 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first man who was selected as a witness of Jehovah God from amongst men was Abel, who faithfully obeyed Almighty God and received God’s approval. (Gen. 4:4) His brother Cain was a religionist, the murderer of Abel, and was cursed by Jehovah. (Gen. 4: 5-12) “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he [Abel] obtained [the] witness that he was righteous.”—Heb. 11:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the time of Abel onward Jehovah God continued to select his witnesses from amongst men. The next name appearing amongst those selected was Enoch, who “pleased God”. The Scriptures then add: '^Without faith it is impossible to please [God].” (Heb. 11:5,6) Such of necessity means that God would never select any man as his witness who is without faith or who is unfaithful. God then selected and gave approval to Noah as one of his witnesses. Noah was joyfully obedient to the will of Almighty God, “a preacher of righteousness/’ and whose testimony was a rebuke to the religious practitioners, all of whom were destroyed in the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah then mentions Abraham, whom he calls His “friend”. To Abraham he gave promise that in due time blessings should come to all the families of the earth who would be obedient to him. Because Abraham was faithfully obedient to the will of God he received the approval of the Most High and is designated as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Concerning Abraham it is recorded in the Bible: “For he looked for a city [organization or kingdom of Almighty God] which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.” —Heb. 11:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Favorable mention and approval is also made in the Scriptures of Sarah, Isaac and Jacob, all of whom received God’s commendation and approval, and who by faith devoted themselves to God and set their hopes and affections upon The Theocratic Government, and, as it is written: “Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city [a place in The Theocratic Government].” Jehovah also selected and mentioned with his approval as his witnesses Joseph, Moses, Rahab, Gideon, Barak, Samson, David, Samuel, and all the faithful prophets, which includes those from Moses to John the Baptist. Jehovah God selected them as his witnesses, and they were all faithful to their appointment and commission. All of them suffered great persecution at the hands of religionists, and of and concerning them it is written in the Bible: “Of whom the world was not worthy.” All of them received the commendation and approval of Jehovah God. (Heb. 11:4-40) Those faithful witnesses of Jehovah who bore testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom have the promise of the Almighty God that they shall be resurrected from death and made the visible princes or governors in the earth under the great Theocratic King, Christ Jesus. (Ps. 45:16) They shall rule under the great and righteous King, Christ Jesus; as it is written: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isa. 32:1) Then the people will rejoice. That will be in great contrast to the present-day rule of dictators and ambitious politicians : “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.”—Prov. 29: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, the great true and faithful Witness of Jehovah, when on earth at all times, and on repeated occasions, emphasized the importance of the Kingdom. His speech and teachings publicly and otherwise were at all times concerning The Theocracy. To all his followers he gave admonition that they should continuously pray to Jehovah God: “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen [religionists, who use vain repetitions and constantly finger their beads, thinking they shall be heard and answered] do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.” Continuing, Jesus said: “Be not ye therefore like unto them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matt. 6:7-10) This further shows that the coming establishment of The Theocratic Government is the great and important purpose of Jehovah, and which must be carried out by Christ Jesus the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful apostles of Jesus Christ were selected by Jehovah and given to Jesus as witnesses of Jehovah. For three and one-half years Jesus had continuously given testimony to the name and kingdom of Jehovah God and had instructed his disciples whom God had chosen and given to him. When he had finished his earthly work he addressed himself to Jehovah his Father in these words: “I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.” —John 17: 6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the days of the apostles forward Jehovah continued to select his witnesses to bear testimony to his name and his kingdom in the earth. Those proving faithful God assigns to a place in “the body” or organization of Christ Jesus; and concerning such it is written : “But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.” (1 Cor. 12:18) This is conclusive proof that Jehovah's witnesses are those, and those only, whom God selects, and whom no man can select.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fully aware of God’s purpose to have his witnesses in the earth, and after reviewing the selection of these witnesses by Jehovah God from Abel to John the Baptist, and after calling attention to Christ Jesus, the great “Faithful and True Witness”, the faithful apostle Paul, also one of Jehovah’s witnesses, selected by Jehovah God and under inspiration of God, gives this admonition to all persons who enter into a covenant to be fully obedient unto Jehovah God and his kingdom, to wit: “Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.” (Heb. 12:1-3) This is further and corroborative proof that Jehovah’s covenant people, selected and anointed by him, are his witnesses, and not subject to the orders of men contrary to God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the light of the foregoing Scriptural testimony it must be admitted by all sincere persons that it would be blasphemy to claim that any man is the founder and organizer of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is offering an indignity to Almighty God to designate his witnesses as “a sect or cult”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As further evidence as to who constitute Jehovah's witnesses, and who selects them, note the following Scriptural proof. In this present day all the world is under religious influence or demonism. There are numerous religious organizations operating with other political rulers and gangsters, together claiming the right to rule the earth, which claim constitutes blasphemy of the name of Jehovah God and his King. Divers remedies are offered to the people by these nations and their rulers, each offered remedy claiming that such respective remedy would bring about a satisfactory condition to the people. All of them deny God and Christ and are opposed to The Theocratic Government. Are they justified in their claims and the position they take? Jehovah speaks and says: “Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled; who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.” (Isa. 43:9) Otherwise stated, God commands that the religionists justify themselves by their testimony or else admit that they are wrong and then accept the truth. Then addressing those who have covenanted to do the will of God and who have devoted themselves unconditionally to the great Theocracy, Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you; therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.”—Isa. 43:10-12.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>HOW SELECTED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What must a person do in order to put himself in line to be selected by Jehovah as one of his witnesses? He must believe or have faith that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God, and that Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God, is man’s redeemer. “Without faith it is impossible to please [God] ; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” (Heb. 11:6) To all such as have a sincere desire to be followers of Christ Jesus, and hence servants of God, Jesus says: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” (Matt. 16: 24) Obeying these injunctions, the person unconditionally agrees to do the will of God, and that means his consecration of himself to do whatsoever the Lord’s commandments direct him to do. The will of God concerning all such persons is stated in the Bible, and therefore the Scriptures constitute the guide for the Christian. To 'deny oneself’, as Jesus directs, means that the person must put aside his own selfish will and determine to be guided by the will of God. If God accepts the consecration of that person, he begets him, that is to say, he acknowledges that person to be his servant and son for his purpose: “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” (Jas. 1:18) Thus Jehovah God accepts that person or selects him to be his servant, and from that time forward that servant is in a covenant to do the will of God, even as Jesus likewise does the will of his Father. (Ps. 40:8) The servant is called to follow where Christ Jesus, the Master, leads: “For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.”—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How may the servant or person know that he is in a covenant to do God’s will? The spirit of God reveals it to him; as it is written: “The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.” (Rom, 8:16) Does that consecrated person need some other person, some man, to tell him whether he is a follower of Christ Jesus or not? No; because it is an individual matter between the creature and the Lord as to whether or not that person is in a covenant with God and has been accepted by the Lord. The person judges himself by the fixed rale of God, which never changes, and if he is the servant of God the spirit of God enlightens his mind and instructs him. Says the Lord God to such chosen ones: “I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine eye.” (Ps. 32:8) For that reason it is absolutely necessary for the creature thus consecrating himself to carefully study the Word of God that he may be informed as to God’s will concerning him. God anoints his selected or “elect” ones by his spirit: “But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.”—1 John 2: 27.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>HIS NAME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For what purpose does God select his servants? In order that such persons so selected may be witnesses to the name and kingdom of Jehovah God. It is written: “God at the first did visit the Gentiles [nonJews], to take out of them a people for his name.” (Acts 15:14) Those who are selected by the Lord God must thereafter be witnesses to the name of Jehovah, the Almighty God, and to his kingdom. His name has been reproached for centuries, his name must be vindicated, and Jehovah commands that a witness concerning his name must be given before that day of vindication. The consecrated person who is selected as Jehovah’s witness must therefore proclaim His name and purpose to others. (Ex. 9:16) He must become a “preacher of righteousness”; which means that he must proclaim to those who will hear the Word and purpose of Jehovah God, who is righteous. He must proclaim God’s truth, and not the teachings or traditions of men. To do so he receives authority from the Lord, and is responsible to the Lord God for what he does or fails to do.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>ORDAINED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To be ordained means to be appointed by the proper authority to a position or office to perform the duties specifically assigned. Jehovah’s witnesses being selected by Jehovah, it follows that Jehovah is the authority that ordains the servant. Therefore it is written: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” —Isa. 61:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That scripture states the commission of authority given by the Lord God to those persons who are selected by him and made his witnesses. Thereafter such persons must be obedient to God’s commandments; as it is written: ‘Obedience is better than sacrifice.’ (1 Sam. 15:22) “Study to shew thyself approved unto God,” and not unto man. (2 Tim. 2:15) As the follower in the footsteps of Jesus Christ such person must be obedient to the commandments of the Lord and thereby prove his integrity toward Almighty God. His eternal existence now depends upon full obedience to God’s commandments. To such persons the rule is announced by the Lord: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the erown of life.” (Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> As Christ Jesus, when on the earth, continuously proclaimed the name and kingdom of Jehovah, so all his followers must proclaim the name and kingdom of Jehovah in order that they may prove their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The body of Christians now on the earth and known as Jehovah’s witnesses are a united body, operating together as one, that is, in full unity. (Eph. 4:13,15) As a body of Christians following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus they carry forward their work harmoniously to the praise of Jehovah. To aid them in doing so and to work to the best advantage that body of Christians have the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to act for them and in their behalf. That Society carries forward the work of these Christians in an orderly manner. To each one who gives evidence that he is fully devoted to God and his kingdom and that he is wholly devoted to the service of God, in obedience to his commandments, the Society issues a paper or card of identification showing that such person is recognized by the body of Christians composing the Society as an ordained minister and servant of the Lord. This does not mean that no one else is an ordained minister who does not receive such card of identification. The real ordination comes from Jehovah God himself. Such card of identification is issued by the Society only to those who are the representatives of such Society. With such person the Society cooperates in the publication of the name of Jehovah God and of his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>STUDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In many cities, towns and communities throughout the earth classes or companies of Jehovah’s witnesses are maintained and those companies or classes regularly meet, many times during the week, to engage in careful and prayerful study of the Bible; and to do so they use the publications of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in order that they may study the Scriptures in an orderly way and get a better understanding of the will of God concerning them. Such persons are real students of the Scriptures and, being unselfishly devoted to The Theocracy and guided by the spirit of the Lord, they learn the Scriptures and the meaning thereof. These study classes are led by elders, that is, by persons of the company who are more mature and are well qualified and apt to teach. Every person who loves righteousness and who desires to learn of God and of his kingdom is welcome to attend those studies and participate and receive instruction. Such schools of instruction of the Scriptures are held and conducted each and every week of the year to the great profit of those who attend.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>PREACHING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To “preach” means to proclaim a message. “Preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God” means the proclaiming to others the Scriptural truths of and concerning Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ Jesus. Each and every one of Jehovah’s witnesses commissioned as aforesaid is commanded to preach God’s message of truth to all who will hear. Such is the means of bearing witness to the name and kingdom of Jehovah. They are not witnesses for any human organization, but are witnesses for the Most High, the great Theocrat. Having received a commission from God to preach, and being commanded by him to preach, such consecrated persons must engage in preaching or proclaiming to others who will hear. That message delivered must be that which is proclaimed in the Scriptures, particularly with reference to the kingdom of Jehovah. They must preach or make known the good news in obedience to God’s commandment, and when men attempt to prevent them from thus preaching they must follow the rule announced by the faithful apostles of Christ Jesus, to wit: “We ought to obey God rather than men.”—Acts 5: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The indisputable physical facts that have come to pass in this generation, taken together with the prophecies of Jehovah God written in the Bible and relating to the Kingdom, show beyond-any question of doubt that the second coming of Christ Jesus to begin his reign as King took place in 1914, when he was enthroned and sent forth by Jehovah to begin that rule. (Ps. 110:2; Rev. 11:17,18; Matt. 24:1-25) The fulfilled prophecies show that the “world”, or rule by Satan without interruption, came to an end in 1914 and from then Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocratic Government, under authority from Jehovah God, is sent forth to rule and to completely oust Satan and all of his agents, and to establish righteousness in all the world. The coming of Christ Jesus the King has been the hope of Christian people for more than 1900 years, and his coming is good news or gospel to all who have a desire to see the will of God done on earth. To all such this ^commandment is given by the Lord: ‘This gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached throughout the world, as a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come? (Matt. 24:14) In obedience to this commandment Jehovah’s witnesses must engage in a campaign to advertise the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In obedience to this specific commandment from the Lord Jehovah’s witnesses go from place to place and from house to house, calling upon the people and informing those who will hear of the good news that the kingdom of heaven is here. Unlike religious denominations, who meet in houses and perform certain formal ceremonies, Jehovah’s witnesses go to the people and talk with them. They take to the people books, booklets, magazines and other printed matter concerning the Scriptures which enable the people to find in the Scriptures the full and complete proof of this good news and that the Kingdom is at hand, and thus the people are enabled to stay in their own homes and learn of God’s gracious provision for them. Throughout all the earth where there are companies of Jehovah’s witnesses each individual, as opportunity is afforded, engages in thus preaching this gospel of the Kingdom. The corporations above mentioned do the printing and manufacturing of such literature as is distributed and manage the witness work in an orderly manner. All this work is done without pecuniary profit to any person. Furthermore, persons who do engage in this witness work contribute their own money to carry on the work. There is but one purpose in our lives, and that is to make known Jehovah’s kingdom and the blessings it will bring to humankind.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>WHY THE NAME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Why is the name &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses” given to the body of Christian men engaged in preaching this gospel of The Theocracy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All true followers of Christ Jesus are Jehovah’s witnesses, whether they are called that or not. Since the days of Jesus in the flesh and of his apostles, who walked with him, there have been some faithful followers of Christ Jesus on earth, and hence witnesses of Jehovah. Within a short time after the death of the apostles selfish and ambitious men amongst the Christians set about to organize denominations called “churches” or “church organizations”. Immediately such organizations were presided over by the stronger and there was introduced and taught therein the doctrines and theories of men, and quickly the teachings of the Bible were greatly ignored. Such organizations or religious systems designated themselves as religious churches, and now they teach the doctrines or traditions of men, which is contrary to the will of God, and which traditions make the Scriptures of none effect. The Jews fell into a like error, and concerning such Jesus said to the leaders, to wit: “Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites! well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand.”—Matt. 15: 6-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even the apostle Paul had fallen into that error and followed traditions, until the Lord opened his mental understanding to the truth, and then he spurned religion as an enemy and thereafter followed Christ Jesus and taught the doctrines set forth in the Bible. Read carefully Galatians 1:1-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic system of religion claims to be the official organization of the Lord, but the Scriptures show that such claim is entirely without foundation and truth. The Catholic organization was founded by men and has never represented the Lord God or Christ Jesus. As a protest against the Catholic organization and system of operations, many other organizations called “churches” were formed, and these have designated themselves as the “Protestant” religious organizations. As is well known, this condition has obtained over a period of many centuries. All such religious organizations have, as it appears, entirely forgotten about The Theocracy. At least they fully ignore The Theocratic Government, and none of them emphasize the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society was organized by Pastor Russell and his associated brethren in Christ, that Society stood out entirely separate and distinct from all church or religious denominations. Pastor Russell repeatedly by word of mouth and by his writings pointed out that the denominational church systems are not Christian, and hence he called such organizations “churchianity” as contradistinguished from Christianity. Pastor Russell was a real Christian and therefore a witness of Jehovah, and the term “Jehovah’s witness” properly applies to him; but that distinction had not been revealed clearly to Christians in his day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The end of the world,” as aforestated, came in 1914, and that truth Pastor Russell for years previous had strongly emphasized. He died in the year 1916. In 1918 the Lord Jesus Christ came to the temple of Jehovah, that is to say, to the body of consecrated Christians whom he gathered unto himself and whom he then put to a severe trial or test, as stated in Malachi 3:1-3. The days that followed his coming to the temple and his judgment there were days of real testing. Many who claimed to be his followers turned baek from following after the Lord. Others manifesting selfishness were not approved by him and were set aside. Some who were w’holly devoted to the Lord and were not followers of men were approved by the Lord and taken into the temple, that is, the Lord gathered them unto himself. The temple of God is not made with hands, but consists of the company or body of faithful followers of Christ Jesus. (1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Cor. 6:15-17) Those persons thus fully devoted to the Lord, and who were approved by him in his judgment, were gathered into the temple or to “the body” of his organization, and to them the Lord committed “His goods”, that is to say, Kingdom interests on earth, as stated by him in Matthew 24:45-47. Those who fail in that judgment because of their wrong heart condition the Lord designates as the “evil servant”. —Matt. 24:48-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the temple judgment began in 1918, not until 1922 was it understood by the consecrated of earth that the Lord was at the temple. From that time forward the Lord began to reveal to his followers the meaning of prophecy, and all of the anointed now on earth can truly testify that since 1922 the Lord has continuously illuminated the prophecies, revealed the meaning, and made them understandable by his people, greatly to the joy of all his servants. They have therefore a clearer vision of God’s Word, because it is his due time to reveal to them why the Lord has enabled the followers of Christ to have an understanding of the will of God, and to progress in the service of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pastor Russell never claimed to have any followers. It was not pleasing to him to have his brethren called “Russellites”. Books which he wrote and published were called “Millennial Dawn”, meaning the dawn of the thousand-year reign of Christ. Many persons thereafter called Pastor Russell and his brethren “Millennial Dawnites”. After the organization of the corporation International Bible Students Association that body of Christian people were generally called “International Bible Students”. Pastor Russell never adopted any name for himself and his associates except that of Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah’s witnesses,” as hereinbefore stated, is a term which has always been applicable to those who are fully devoted to Jehovah God and his service. Pastor Russell, because of his faithfulness to the Lord, was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but the meaning of many prophecies was not revealed in his day and hence </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">understood. While the facts show that from and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">after 1922 </span><span class="font5">in particular the Lord gradually unfolded </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to his </span><span class="font5">faithful servants the meaning of the prophecies, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it was not </span><span class="font5">until 1931 that the name of those fully de</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">voted </span><span class="font5">to Jehovah God and his King was properly understood to be &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religion has been confusing to Christian people for </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">■man</span><span class="font5">y centuries. Religion brought about the confusion amongst those who were associated with Pastor Russell. Because of having been associated with religionists many things pertaining to religion clung to them until they had a better understanding of God’s purpose. All of these things were foreknown by the Lord centuries ago: &quot;Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.”—Acts 15:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is not the God of confusion, but the God of order; and when the time came for the gathering of his people to Christ Jesus at the temple, and the time to reveal to them his purpose, he began to set them in order by showing them what they must do. It was therefore to be expected that in due time he would make dear to his people their proper relationship to him. The appropriate time was after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple. Without doubt the Lord has directed the publication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in 1931 published an article calling attention particularly to the following text, which applies to the servants of Almighty God who are faithfully performing their covenant, to wit: “For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">new name,</span><span class="font5"> which the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mouth of the Lord shall name.”</span><span class="font5">—Isa. 62:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Zion is the name of God’s organization of which Christ Jesus is the Head. It is written: “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” (Ps. 102:16) The building up of Zion began after</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1918, and thereafter the glory of the Lord more fully continued to appear unto those devoted to him. Christ Jesus at the temple, having gathered unto himself his approved followers at the temple as stated above, shows that the foregoing text of Isaiah 62:1, 2 applies to those gathered at the temple. That text states that these so gathered will be given “a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name”. Mark this emphatic statement: that the name is not given by any man, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">but by “the mouth of the Lord”.</span><span class="font5"> Previous to that these faithful Christians had been known by various names, as above stated, but now the Lord makes known to them that they are gathered to him and he states: “Ye are my witnesses.” (Isa. 43:10-12) Thus the mouth of the Lord gives his faithful people a name that properly identifies them, and puts them in the class with his other faithful witnesses who have from time to time been on the earth from Abel down to the present hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “evil servant” class, being evil, continued to go contrary to the will of God and to oppose and to smite God’s servants who persist in proclaiming The Theocracy. Therefore Jehovah says to the “evil servant” : “But ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number. Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not. Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his servants by another name”—</span><span class="font5">Isa. 65:11-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1931, </span><span class="font5">at a convention of God’s consecrated people </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Meld </span><span class="font5">at Columbus, Ohio, that body of Christians, ha-v-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing fully </span><span class="font5">considered the foregoing Bible text, then and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font5">unanimously adopted a resolution, as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Whereas shortly following the death of Charles </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T. </span><span class="font5">Russell a division arose between those associated •with him in such work, resulting in a number of such withdrawing from the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and who have since refused to cooperate with said Society and its work and who decline to concur in the truth as published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and the other recent publications of the above-named corporations, and have opposed and do now oppose the work of said Society in declaring the present message of God’s kingdom and the day of the vengeance of our God against all parts of Satan’s organization ; and said opposing ones have formed themselves into divers and numerous companies, and have taken and now bear such names as, to wit, ‘Bible Students,’ ‘Associated Bible Students,’ ‘Russellites teaching the truth as expounded by Pastor Russell,’ •Stand-Pasters,’ and like names, all of which tends to cause confusion and misunderstanding:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Now, therefore, in order that our true position may be made known, and believing that this is in harmony with the will of God, as expressed in his Word, re it resolved, as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘That we have great love for Brother Charles T. Russell, for his work’s sake, and that we gladly acknowledge that the Lord used him and greatly blessed his work; yet we cannot consistently with the Word of God consent to be called by the name ‘Russellites’ that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and the International Bible Students Association and the Peoples Pulpit Association are merely names of corporations, which corporations we as a company of Christian people hold, control and use to carry on our work in obedience to God’s commandments, yet none of these names properly attach to or apply to us as a </span><span class="font5">body of Christians who follow in the footsteps of our Lord and Master, Christ Jesus; that we are students of the Bible, but, as a body of Christians forming an Association, we decline to assume or to be called by the name TBible Students’ or similar names as a means of identification of our proper position before the Lord; we refuse to bear or to be called by the name of any man;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That, having been bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ our Lord and Redeemer, justified and begotten by Jehovah God and called to his kingdom, we unhesitatingly declare our entire allegiance and devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom; that we are servants of Jehovah God and his kingdom; that we are servants of Jehovah God commissioned to do a work in his name, and, in obedience to his commandment, to deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known to the people that Jehovah is the true and almighty God; therefore we joyfully embrace and take the name which the mouth of the Lord God has named, and we desire to be known as and called by the name, to wit, ‘Jehovah’s witnesses.’—Isa. 43:10-12; 62:2; Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As Jehovah’s witnesses our sole and only purpose is to be entirely obedient to his commandments; to make known that he is the only true and almighty God; that his Word is true and that his name is entitled to all honor and glory; that Christ is God’s King, whom he has placed upon his throne of authority; that his kingdom is now come, and in obedience to the Lord’s commandments we must now declare this good news as a testimony or witness to the nations and to inform the rulers and the people of and concerning Satan’s cruel and oppressive organization, and particularly with reference to ‘Christendom’, which is the most wicked part of that visible organization; and of and concerning God’s purpose to shortly destroy Satan’s organization, which great act will be quickly followed by Christ the King’s bringing to the obedient peoples of earth peace and prosperity, liberty and health, happiness and everlasting life; that God’s kingdom is the hope of the world and there is no other, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">this message must be delivered by those who are identified as Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“We </span><span class="font5">humbly invite all persons who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom to join in proclaiming this good news to others, that the righteous standard of the Lord may be lifted up, that the peoples of the world may know where to find the truth and hope for relief; and, above all, that the great and holy name of Jehovah God may be vindicated and exalted.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>HIS MESSAGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The message which Jehovah’s witnesses deliver to the people is not their message. It is the message of Jehovah, the Almighty God, and his King. They deliver that message in obedience to God’s commandment. In delivering God’s message Jehovah’s witnesses have no desire or inclination to do injury to any individual. They are messengers of peace. Their enemies call them bigots and intolerant, but this charge is entirely wrong. The message being that which emanates from Almighty God, they could not be bigots by speak ing his message and they could not be intolerant by proclaiming what God commands. They have no controversy with men. They must tell God’s Word of truth because he commands that such must be done. His truth is a joy to the heart of every person who loves righteousness. On the contrary, it is like a two-edged sword to all who hold steadfastly to religion. It cuts both ways and exposes error. Religion destroys belief in God and in his Theocratic Government. The proclamation of God’s Word necessarily exposes religion as a snare of Satan in which many persons are caught. The Scriptures, together with the facts, show that religion is used as a racket. Therefore the Scriptures give this admonition to the Christian: &quot;Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.”— Heb. 4:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in 1914 that Satan’s uninterrupted rule of the world came to an end, and it was then that Christ Jesus, the King of Jehovah, was sent forth to rule and to oust Satan. For many long centuries Satan has been the god or invisible ruler of this wicked world, blinding the minds of the people to the truth and turning them away from Almighty God. (2 Cor. 4:4) Religion is Satan’s chief means by which he blinds the people. It was in 1914 to 1918 that there was a “war in heaven”, in which Christ Jesus and his angels fought against the Devil and his angels and which resulted in casting the Devil and his angels down to the earth. (Rev. 12:1-9) From that time forward God’s message of the Kingdom, The Theocracy, must be proclaimed by his faithful witnesses, and it is to be expected that the Devil and all his forces would bitterly oppose the proclamation of that message and try to destroy the messengers. The facts show that this is exactly what he has done. At the same time the Devil brings woe after woe upon the rulers and upon the peoples of the earth, the purpose being to turn them against Almighty God. Therefore it is written: <sup>&lt;f</sup>Woe to the in-habiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the message of Jehovah God proclaiming his purpose which the Devil and his servants hate, and necessarily they hate everyone who is a witness for Jehovah and who brings God’s message to the people. The Lord Jesus as the Head of the capital organization of the Almighty has committed to God’s faithful servants his message and has sent them forth to deliver it, and “the Dragon” (which is one of the names </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the Devil) and his “woman” (which is his religious organization) makes war against these witnesses of the Lord and tries to destroy them; as it is written: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman [God’s woman or organization], and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Rev. 12:17) All who view this matter from an unbiased standpoint can readily see why Jehovah’s witnesses are now so bitterly opposed and persecuted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>VIOLENT OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">More than five thousand years ago Jehovah the Almighty announced his purpose to set up his Theocratic Government, which shall destroy wickedness and bring everlasting blessings to the obedient ones of humankind. Who could be opposed to that kingdom ? Certainly no one who loves Almighty God. It was the Devil who defied God and challenged him to put any man on earth who would remain true to God when put to the test. (Job 2: 5) Since God’s announced purpose is to prove the Devil a liar and to vindicate his own name by having his King, Christ Jesus, set up his righteous organization and destroy the Devil and his agencies, it is easy to be seen that it is the Devil who opposes The Theocracy and bitterly fights against all those who are for The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the day when Jesus was anointed King, at the Jordan, the Devil has put forth his endeavors to destroy the King and his followers. (Matt. 4:1-11) John the Baptist had announced the coming of the King, Christ Jesus, and the Devil bitterly opposed John. Thereafter when Jesus had begun his ministry and the Devil was fighting him he uttered these words: “And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suifereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”—Matt. 11:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the end of three and one-half years of the ministry of Jesus on the earth he was violently put to death by the agents of the Devil, namely, the religious organizations. To them Jesus had said: “But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God; this did not Abraham. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.”— John 8:40, 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The man Jesus, being the chief one among all of the Jews, comes clearly within the purview of the scripture, to wit: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” (1 Cor. 10:11) When Jesus was violently put to death the nails by which he was fastened to the tree were driven into his hands and into his feet, which prophetically and symbolically testified that the early members of “the body of Christ” and the last members thereof would particularly suffer violence at the hands of the Devil and his religious agents. The hands more particularly therefore pictured the apostles, all of whom suffered much persecution and violence and died at the hands of the violent. And now those on earth who are called “the remnant” of God’s people suffer violence at the hands of the Devil and his representatives. And why? Because they, like Christ Jesus, speak the truth of God, of his name, and of and concerning his Theocracy. God looks upon his faithful witnesses on the earth as the “feet” members of Christ Jesus and describes them as beautiful because they are wholly devoted to him and his King. He has now sent them forth to bear testimony before mankind of the name of Jehovah and of his King and the Kingdom, and as the representatives of the Lord; and of the feet members of Christ’s “body” God caused this record to be made: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that pub-lisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!”—Isa. 52: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus the witnesses of Jehovah, beginning with the anointing of Christ Jesus and ineluding his apostles and the last members on earth, are definitely identified aS the ones who suffer violence. The Devil and his agents are likewise definitely identified as the ones who do violence to God’s faithful servants. Never in the history of man has there been such widespread, organized, vicious, wicked violence done to Christian people as just now. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font5">magazines and other publications of the aforementioned Society have given publication to much of that violence and wickedness. It would not be possible to here recount all the violent deeds committed by the religious agents in the United States against the witnesses of Jehovah during the past twelve months. Heretofore attention has been called to this wicked persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and many other countries, and now we call attention only to a few of the glaring acts of violent wickedness done in the United States against those who are the servants of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this land of America, known as &quot;the land of the free”, Catholic priests in recent months have incited the ignorant to form mobs, and on many occasions such priests have led such mobs that have violently assaulted, bruised, beaten and inflicted great bodily injury upon men, women, and children because such faithful persons were engaged in advertising the kingdom of God under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Public officials, such as policemen, sheriffs, prosecuting attorneys, and magistrates, acting with many other ignorant persons and goaded on by priests of religion, have repeatedly broken the law of the nation and of the states by violent deeds committed against inoffensive and harmless persons who are doing nothing but preach this gospel of the kingdom of God. Such violent and fanatical mobs have broken down doors and windows in houses in which Jehovah’s witnesses were at the time, entered upon those premises where Bible study and worship were being conducted, and there destroyed the furniture and the literature, books and Bibles of Jehovah’s witnesses, driven them out and beaten and bruised Them with great violence. Such religious mobs have destroyed numerous automobiles, torn down or burned houses of Jehovah’s witnesses, kidnaped many of them, and driven them like brute beasts away from their homes. Such religious mobs, led by fanatical Catholic priests, have induced their dupes to tie together with ropes a number of Jehovah’s witnesses and then to have a so-called “doctor” with a stomach pump pour castor oil down the throats of these Christians and then drive them through the streets like brute beasts, deriding them with all kinds of epithets. Thus are we reminded of the vicious deeds of violence that were heaped upon the Lord Jesus when he was on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such mobs have taken possession of houses and of mercantile stores, confiscated the property of the owners, driven the owners out of the country and destroyed their property. Others have broken down and burned houses to the ground, burned the cars, the books, the clothing, and even the money of Jehovah’s witnesses. Religious public officials have stood by and offered no means of protection, but rather encouraged mobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such lawless elements have committed the violent act of castrating a harmless man with a butcher knife and left him in the woods to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only the spirit of the Devil could prompt public, judicial officials to encourage mobs and ill-treat and abuse any person. At Connersville, Indiana, two faithful Christian women met with others to study the Bible and then went about distributing among the people </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> which publication is devoted entirely to the cause of preaching of God’s kingdom and the blessings it will bring to the people. For this offense they were arrested and indicted with the crime of sedition, put upon trial before the court presided over by a man as judge who has neither regard for law nor sense of justice, and in which the prosecuting attorney and his assistants and the sheriff and the judge, each and every one, violated every right of these two harmless citizens of America, and induced the jury to convict them, and they were sent to prison for a long term, and while these words are being written they are in solitary confinement. A few years ago it would not have been thought possible for such a high-handed act of violence to be committed against anyone. And not content that these citizens should be denied fair trial, the brave lawyers who had the courage to defend them were threatened repeatedly, and mobs violently assaulted some of those lawyers and beat them up unmercifully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In certain places in Kentucky and West Virginia Jehovah’s witnesses are indicted upon the charge of sedition because of advocating the kingdom of God. In one court witnesses of Jehovah are under indictment, which charge in substance is: “The accused was found in possession of an instrument, to wit, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> which is inimical to the state and to the United States.” In every instance the act of the religionists and public officials has been lawless, and officers, charged with protection of citizens, have utterly disregarded the constitutional rights of citizens and violently persecuted and assaulted Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the Protestant ministers are some who look with horror upon the wicked deeds of violence committed by fanatical mobs led by Catholic priests against Jehovah’s witnesses. They have some mental vision of what took place in the Dark Ages, and they see now that these deeds of violence committed in the present time threaten the liberties of all the people who love freedom. They see that these acts of violence committed against innocent men, women and children not only are outrageous but bespeak what is in the minds of Satan’s agents to do against all people of the land who love liberty. Concerning such violence Doctor F. M. Eliot writes to all the Unitarian ministers the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For many weeks my heart and conscience have been troubled by the series of outbreaks in several parts of the country against Jehovah’s witnesses. There has undoubtedly been real provocation, and I suspect the ‘witnesses’ have been annoying and irritating on many occasions. But the fact remains that a comparatively small number of devout, perhaps fanatical, people have roused in this country of ours a wave of intense and bitter animosity, so that mob violence and all the familiar paraphernalia of religious persecution have once again appeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Here, in my opinion, is the material ready at hand for a terrible exhibition of blind, hysterical, utterly cruel and senseless passion. It is an alarming symptom of a dangerous condition in our American life today. I believe it is our duty, as ministers of Unitarian churches, to take the lead in creating a more sober and rational state of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I hope all of you will keep yourselves informed concerning this matter, giving special attention to incidents in your own communities. I hope you will preach and speak on the importance of keeping cool and steady under emotional provocation. I hope you will not hesitate to speak out in vigorous protest against any assault upon the rights of these fellowcitizens of ours. I hope you will co-operate in every way with the American Civil Liberties Union in their effort to champion the rights of these people. I hope you will do all in your power to make your church . and your people a strong influence for fair play to everyone—even to those who may seem to be deliberately seeking to provoke attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Together we may be able to help stem this tide. Here is an immediate opportunity to show that our professions of tolerance and Christian charity are something more than pious phrases.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Michigan Christian Advocate</span><span class="font5"> of August 8,1940, editorially speaks in kindness of Jehovah’s witnesses, from which the following paragraphs are quoted: “Here is a group that, in this year of our Lord 1940, is not ashamed to witness for Christ in an unmistakable manner. It believes in Jesus and makes it known. In a day when religion has taken on a kind of compromising sophistication, when some church members think membership an end instead of a beginning of witnessing for Christ, when all too many of us hesitate to speak a testimony for fear of embarrassment, these witnesses come on the contemporary scene as a challenge to our pagan complacency. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Perhaps more important for the present than any of the foregoing is the attention this sect has brought to the problem of religious freedom in a nation which is fast becoming fascist. The fact that this group is a small minority does not change the principles of religious freedom which have been violated in the persecution of it. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Granting that Jehovah’s witnesses have violated minor laws and ordinances, they have not done so with any malicious intent and they certainly do not justify the more lawless acts of mob violence committed against them. Even though most of us cannot agree with the creed of this sect we cannot afford to overlook the issue of religious liberty which has been sharpened by its recent activities. If the church really desires to be a witness for Christ in the days ahead, the hour has come to protect the freedom which makes such witnessing possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deep appreciation is here expressed for the kind and sympathetic words published by the foregoing ministers. These sincere men see that the freedom of speech and freedom of worship and assembly, guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, are being denied to Jehovah’s witnesses and that fanatics by their deeds of violence committed against harmless persons threaten the liberties of all decent persons in the land. In this they are right, and Jehovah’s witnesses keenly appreciate their words of sympathy. It is gratifying to see that there are still some Protestant ministers in the land who are willing to express themselves as against the denial of the rights guaranteed by the fundamental law of the land to the citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all kindness it must here be said that those ministers, however, fail to see the real issue. They are missing the greatest opportunity that ever comes to man. They fail to see why such deeds of wickedness are now committed against Jehovah’s witnesses and what is certain to follow. In brief, this matter is here mentioned with the hope that some of those kind-hearted ministers may see their further privilege of boldly taking their stand on the side of the King and the Kingdom before it is too late for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While it is right and proper that they should protest against violence and the destruction of liberty, it is of paramount importance that they see the great issue and know that it is a fight of the Devil against God and his kingdom, and that the kingdom for which Jesus taught his people to pray is now here and only those who take their stand on the side of the Kingdom shall be saved.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>WHO PERSECUTED?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This fact, which is indisputable, stands out prominently, to wit: There are no Catholic, Protestant or other religious ministers in the land that now suffer violence at the hands of mobs, law officials, or others because of the doctrines taught and practiced by them; There is no religious organization on the earth that is suffering persecution because of their advocacy, of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ. In the fanatical turmoil of the world religious leaders participate now with politicians and go with them hand in hand and are entirely silent as to the great Theocratic Government. In the United States the Constitutional rights of religious institutions are not violated. Catholics, Protestants and other religious leaders work together and receive the protection and commendation of political officials of all political parties. With all kindness this question is now propounded to the ministers and others who look with horror upon the persecution of Christians because they do their duty, to wit: Have the Protestant ministers, like Esau, sold their birthright for a mess of pottage? Those Protestant ministers must shortly come to see their real position and take their stand firmly on one side or the other.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>WHY VIOLENCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Is there any Catholic or Protestant or other religious system or organization of men on the earth that now exalts the name of Jehovah God and Christ his King and that tells the people that the great Theocratic Government under Christ is at hand, and that it is the only hope of the human race? Not one! Do not all religious organizations support some worldly plan or scheme for world recovery and human blessings? Are not all the religious organizations now ‘friends of the world’, that is to say, willingly co-operating with the visible rulers of the world and thereby ignoring the name of Jehovah and his King and kingdom? Why is it that none of these religious organizations and their ministers suffer persecution because of their faith and practices ? The Scriptures say: ‘If you were of the world, the world would love its own.’ “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.” “Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” (John 15:19; 1 John 2:15; Jas. 4:4) Let those kind Protestant ministers now look well to the Word of God and see wherein their safety lies, and let them see from the Scriptures just why the present unhappy conditions exist on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why are Jehovah’s witnesses the victims of wicked violence inflicted at the hands of fanatical mobs led by religious priests ? Is it because Jehovah’s witnesses are violating any law of the land? No. The highest court of this land has decided that they are clearly within their rights in the distribution of literature and that they cannot be lawfully interrupted. Why do such religious leaders then induce the political rulers to ‘frame mischief by law’ (Ps. 94:20) by enacting divers ordinances contrary to the Constitution of the land for the express purpose of entrapping and punishing Jehovah’s witnesses? Why are Jehovah’s witnesses so violently hated and denounced ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answers to the foregoing questions are here given from the highest authority, the Lord himself, who says to his faithful followers and servants on earth at the time of his second coming, to wit: <sup>&lt;f</sup>Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matt. 24: 9) God foreknew that these conditions would exist today; he foretold them, and now they are fulfilled upon his faithful servants. That body of Christians now on earth Scripturally known as “Jehovah’s witnesses” have taken the name of Jehovah their Father and the name of his King, Christ Jesus, and their sole work is the proclaiming of the name of the Lord and of his kingdom, and for that reason and none other they are hated by all the nations of the earth. In the totalitarian nations many of Jehovah’s witnesses have suffered violent death because they proclaim the name of the Lord. Many more are now imprisoned in Europe and there suffer indescribable cruelty at the hands of fanatical religious officers. In the United States, where democracy once held sway and where the guarantee of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and press was once safeguarded, now Jehovah’s witnesses not only are denied these constitutional rights, but are hated and persecuted by religious, political and judicial rulers, and that hatred is due solely to the fact that they are the faithful servants of God and Christ proclaiming the name and the government of the Most High, which is man’s only hope of salvation. Let the Protestant ministers who have spoken so kindly take heed to these indisputable truths.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>NOT DISMAYED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Although daily suffering cruel persecution at the hands of religious fanatics, Jehovah’s witnesses are not in the least bit discouraged or dismayed. On they joyfully go performing their God-given commission. They know that the persecution which they stiffer is indisputable proof that they are the children of God and that nothing can befall them except by the permission of Almighty God and that all things shall work together for the ultimate good of them because they love God and are called according to his purpose. (Rom. 8:28) If these present-day persecutions had not come upon God's faithful witnesses from the religionists Jehovah’s witnesses would seriously doubt their own standing and position with the Lord and would have every reason to doubt that they are in fact the servants of God. They are the only people on the earth who are now being persecuted because of their stand for and advocacy of the name of Jehovah God and his King, and for this reason they see that they are permitted to have part in the fulfillment of the prophetic utterances of Christ Jesus, to wit: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.” (John 15:19-21) “But take heed to yourselves; for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.”—Mark 13: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long ago Jehovah directed that his name shall be declared throughout the earth immediately before the destruction of the wickedness that now is upon the earth (Ex. 9:16), and it necessarily follows that Jehovah would have his name declared by his witnesses whom he has selected and that the Devil and his agents would hate such witnesses and violently oppose their witness work. Jesus said: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved?’—Matt. 24:14,12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of such violence being permitted to come upon Jehovah’s witnesses is twofold: God has held back his hand and permitted the enemy to do this violence to His servants (1) to give opportunity to all opponents of God’s kingdom to identify themselves as the enemies of God and his kingdom and to mark themselves for destruction, which shall take place at Armageddon; and (2) to permit the faithful servants of God to prove their integrity toward God and thereby prove that God has put men on earth that will remain true and faithful under the most severe test and thus prove the Devil a liar, and that his servants may have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. If Jehovah’s witnesses were without persecution at the hands of religionists they might well believe that they are not sons of God, but bastards: &quot;If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father ehasteneth not ? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.”—Heb. 12: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let the Protestant ministers who have so kindly expressed their sympathy with Jehovah’s witnesses give careful consideration to the foregoing scripture, that they may see and determine whether or not they are the children of God or in the &quot;bastard” class, as the apostle puts it. And particularly that they may see that their greatest privilege now is to take their stand boldly on the side of Jehovah and his King and thereby to bear some of the reproaches that have fallen upon Christ. (Rom. 15: 3; 1 John 4:17,18) Such is the way of salvation to life. There is none other.—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hope of Jehovah’s witnesses is that they may enter into the kingdom of God and forever serve the Most High and forever enjoy life and blessings with the Lord. They know that Satan and all his agents are opposing the Kingdom and fighting against them now to cause them to lose that eternal blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore the faithful apostle of Christ Jesus said: “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God,” (Acts 14:22) All who expect to enter the Kingdom: must pass through that same experience. Therefore say Jehovah’s witnesses with the apostles: 'We rejoice to fill up the sufferings of Christ Jesus, bearing the reproaches that fell upon him.’— Col. 1: 24; Rom. 5:3-5; 15:3; Ps. 69: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil and his religious agents think to defeat Jehovah’s witnesses by browbeating them and violently punishing them; but in these things they do certainly fail. The very greatest punishment the Devil and his agents can possibly inflict upon Jehovah’s witnesses is to kill them, and that the faithful servants of God do not fear. On the contrary, they follow the admonition of Christ Jesus, who says to them: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matt. 10:28) They have the full assurance from Almighty God that if they, for his name’s sake, die in faith and faithful to him and his kingdom they shall have a resurrection unto life everlasting. —1 Cor. 15:12-57; Phil. 3: 8-14; 2 Tim. 4: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Paul, as one pictured by the hand of Jesus in which the nails were driven and who suffered great persecution at the hands of religionists, wrote to his brethren, under inspiration of the holy spirit: “For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 8: 38, 39) Those words of the inspired apostle express exactly the determination of every one of Jehovah’s witnesses now on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “remnant” anointed -witnesses of Jehovah are privileged to carry God’s message to those of goodwill in the earth. Those who are the “other sheep” of the Lord and who shall form the great multitude have the assurance from Jehovah that if now they flee to him and to his kingdom and are obedient to his commandments they shall pass through the great tribulation that shall wreck completely the organization of Satan, and that then they shall live everlastingly on earth in endless joy and have to do with the filling of the earth with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> righteous race. Great numbers of these people of good-will are now hearing and fleeing to the Lord’s organization and are joining with the anointed remnant in bearing witness to the name and to the kingdom of Almighty God. Their hearts are being filled with joy, and they have a hope of lasting life and peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the hope of the Kingdom, and the hope of everlasting life, that is set before a faithful people who continue in faith to the end. It is the privilege of having part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and living forever in righteousness that is set before them, and it is unthinkable that they could be turned away from God by the violent acts or by the influence of the Devil and his earthly agents. Therefore amidst the most wicked and violent persecution these faithful servants of God go on determined to carry out their commission even unto death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the Protestant ministers who have so kindly expressed their sympathy with Jehovah’s witnesses would live, let them now take their stand wholly on the side of The Theocracy and go further than merely to protest against the denial of earthly or constitutional rights; let them with boldness declare themselves for Jehovah and his King. No doubt they sometimes utter the prayer that Jesus taught: &quot;Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.’ The King is here! God’s will shall be done on earth! Only those who boldly declare themselves on the side of the King and his kingdom shall find salvation. No one can with one foot follow after the world and attempt with the other foot to follow the Lord, who has said: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” (Matt. 12:30) No one should think, because he bears the name of Protestant minister and preaches some doctrine in the name of the Lord, that he thereby has the assurance of salvation. He must be entirely for the Lord God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the Kingdom, and must exalt the name of Jehovah and his King and must keep himself separate and distinct from the world. Jesus made this plain by this saying: “Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works ? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” (Matt. 7:22, 23) Workers of iniquity are those who work any way, in any manner, contrary to the expressed law of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every person who has entered into a solemn covenant to do the will of God and who then is governed by the law or commandment of God and who boldly and fearlessly advocates The Theocracy, proclaiming the name of the great Theocrat, Jehovah, and of his King, Christ Jesus, is a witness for Jehovah. Every person who proceeds along the line of tradition and in the way and doctrines of men is acting lawlessly and is against the Kingdom. Every person must determine for himself on whose side he stands, and he must judge himself by the standards set forth in God’s Word, and by no other standard.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>WITHOUT MALICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have no controversy or fight with any human creature because of his religion, politics, nationality or color. They have malice toward no one. They attack the wicked doctrines of Satan and his religious agents and do so by proclaiming God’s Word as commanded. They desire to do good unto all. They speak not the message of man, but the truth of God’s Word, and that message provokes those who are of bad heart against those who love righteousness. To those who desire righteousness, the proclamation of the truth provokes them to love and good works. As the Scriptures plainly declare, religion is demonism because it originated with the chief demon, Satan, and is employed to turn men away from God. Demonism, therefore, or religion, has blinded the minds of men to the truth lest the glorious light of God should shine into their hearts. (2 Cor. 4:4) The whole world now lies in the wicked one. (1 John 5:19) Only those who put themselves on the side of the Lord and his kingdom can escape the clutches of the wicked one. The proclamation of God’s message of truth, therefore, angers those who are blind to the truth and who submit to the influence of demons. Jehovah’s witnesses would help all of good-will to free themselves from demon influence, and for that reason they bring to the attention of the people what is taught in the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not trying to convert the world. That is not their commission. Their commission of authority is to proclaim the truth and let everyone exercise his own desire to believe on and obey the Lord or not. Jehovah’s witnesses avoid controversy and speak the truth in love. They do so unselfishly and fearlessly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>LIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The word “lie” is a harsh word, but it applies chiefly to the author of lies, Satan, and only harsh words can be spoken of him. Satan is the father of lies. (John 8:44) From the beginning he has resorted to lies, fraud, and deception, and his policy is to induce all that yield to his influence and control to likewise resort to lies. Therefore God caused his prophet to record these words as the policy which is adopted by the Devil’s chief religious representatives on this earth, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to wit: “We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.” (Isa. 28:15) Those who fall under the influence of Satan and the Devil and his religious agents take to lying as easily as a duck takes to water. Jehovah’s enemies assault by resorting to lies. By lies employed by religionists the truth is hidden from the people and they are kept in darkness. Almost all the newspapers have fallen into this trap of Satan and by their practices appear to desire lies rather than truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>INTERVIEWS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Newspapers, by their representatives, seek interviews to get matter for a “story”, and out of the facts contained in the information furnished a “story” is made up. No doubt the reporters who gather this information write many facts in their reports, but the man who sits in the swivel chair says: “That will not do. We must make it sensational, and we will dish it up to suit the sensational fanatics and this will not offend our religious higher-ups.” An apt example is that of the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font5"> which paper sent its reporter to get a “story” to publish about Jehovah’s witnesses. The reporter was requested to put his questions in writing. That he did, and answers to his questions were written. When the story appeared in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> it was entirely different from the facts furnished. The truth was entirely omitted and the very opposite was published, and then in order to increase prejudice against Jehovah’s witnesses and to appease the wrath of the religious leaders, the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post </span><span class="font5">sent its reporter to some outside publisher of books, who knows nothing whatsoever about Jehovah’s witnesses and their work, and from that source gathered some “dope” for publication about the cost of the publication of such books by the Society. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> appears to create the impression that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is making large sums of money out of the publication of its literature, and to that end the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> publishes what purports to be information obtained from some undisclosed source as to the cost of books and other publications. This is done for the purpose of estimating the “probable profits” made by the Society. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> entirely ignores the fact that the printing of books or literature is one thing, and the cost of distribution is entirely a different thing. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> does not give any consideration to the faet that the entire office force of the Society, in addition to the printers, those who do the work at the headquarters, must all be fed and housed at the expense of the Society ; and the further faet of the expense of packing, shipping, trucking and other shipping charges, whieh must be paid by the Society; and that the expense of distributing these to the field workers, and the work by them, also cost money; and additional thereto is the cost of advertising the Kingdom work by means of radio and other legitimate means; and furthermore the heavy financial burden that must be borne by the Society in defense of Jehovah’s witnesses who are unlawfully assaulted and committed to prison, and otherwise hindered by religious fanatics; the cost of conventions; the traveling expenses of its many servants; and also the millions of books manufactured and shipped to foreign countries for whieh no return whatsoever in the way of money is received; also the millions of books that are actually given away to sincere persons who are too poor to make contributions. The Society has never declined to furnish anyone because of poverty an opportunity to study the Scriptures concerning the Kingdom, and the use of its literature for that purpose, but has furnished literature to the people who are unable to pay. There are many other things connected with the work of this Society that requires money. But be assured of this: that every penny is made to go as far as possible, and no person makes any pecuniary or money profit out of anything done by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who can contribute for the books and literature a nominal sum do so; and all contributions are used exclusively to carry out the purpose for which the corporation is organized; that is, preaching the gospel and advertising the Kingdom. The contributions each year received for literature are less than the cost of manufacture and publication. The deficit each year must be made up in some manner. And how is it made up? By free and voluntary contributions made by those faithful Christian people who are interested in the kingdom of God and who by tne sweat of their brow earn some money and deny themselves many things that they really need in order that they may contribute to further the interest of Jehovah’s kingdom on earth. For the fiscal year of 1940 the deficit is large, and is now being made up by such free voluntary contributions. In addition to what is above stated, from time to time the Society must send money to foreign countries to aid there in the preaching of the gospel amongst people who are unable to carry on the work themselves.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>FINANCIAL STATEMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The religionists and their representatives who publish newspapers seem to be greatly desirous of having this Society publish its balance sheet. What good will that do to them ? They are in no wise interested in this work, but, on the contrary, are opposed and could demand the same only for the purpose of annoying the Society. Why does not the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> and other like publications ask the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to publish their balance sheet and to inform the people what they do with the vast sums of money they collect for saying prayers for the dead, and the money that they get by other means? It is well known that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has property all over the United States and, in fact, all over the world, and the title and control of all this property is at Vatican City, and great sums of money are collected from the people and handed over to the Hierarchy, but no one ever heard of the Hierarchy publishing their balance sheet. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is not interested in what the Hierarchy do with their money. We try to attend to our own affairs which the Lord has given us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let this be definitely understood: that no money whatsoever is received by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society from any enemy. No political party furnishes one penny, and no one else furnishes a penny save those who are interested in furthering the Kingdom interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic Hierarchy, as is well known, in addition to the numerous sums of money collected from the people, use the public funds that are raised by taxation to carry on certain portions of their organization. If the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> is so interested in what is being done, let it demand a publication of the balance sheets of the Hierarchy. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> is not anxious for the truth, but anxious to do everything possible to hinder the proclamation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s people are carrying forward a campaign for the Kingdom, and all the money received and paid out is devoted exclusively to that purpose and to that end. To be sure, the Lord’s hand is not shortened and he could furnish great sums of money if need be, because all the money and all the cattle on a thousand hills are his; but he permits his devoted people to make personal sacrifices and to have a part in the furtherance of his Kingdom interests, including the carrying of the financial burden, as proof of their faith and devotion to him; and all those who are devoted to him, including the remnant and their companions, count it a great privilege to have some part in bearing these expenses. There is no other institution on earth or that ever has been on earth that does so much work as this Society with so small a sum of money, because there is no one in the organization who desires to make personal pecuniary profit out of such work or anything connected with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">. LIGHT</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font5">Light proceeds from God. He said, “Let there be light”; “and there was light.” (Gen. 1:3) “God is light, and in him [there] is no darkness at all.” (1 John 1: 5) When God sent Jesus to the earth, it was written of him: Tie is the true light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.’ (John 1:9) Jesus Christ is the “express image” of Jehovah, and through him the light of truth shines upon all those who love and serve Jehovah God: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”—2 Cor. 4: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Light is sown [and made known] for the righteous.” (Ps. 97:11) That is to say, only those who love righteousness and seek righteousness are led into the light of God’s Word and truth. The truth of God’s Word is light that makes known what is right and what is wrong. Says the obedient servant of God: “The Lord is my light and my salvation.” (Ps. 27:1) Those persons who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and to his kingdom have been brought out of darkness into the light, and this light proceeds from Jehovah through Christ Jesus to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan and all the demons and all those persons under the influence of demons are in darkness as to Jehovah’s purpose. Therefore it is written: ‘Darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people.’ (Isa. 60: 2) All such are blind to the light of truth; and the religious leaders, as Jesus stated, are “blind guides of the blind”, and all headed for the same end. Those who are now the true followers of Christ Jesus were at one time in darkness, but the Lord brought them out of darkness into the light because of their sincere desire for righteousness and desire to know and to serve the Most High: “For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.”—Eph. 5: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are brought out of darkness and made the anointed servants of God and of Christ are no longer in darkness as to Jehovah’s purposes, and his purposes are revealed or made clear to them. These the Lord calls the children of light, and to them the Scriptures say: “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.”—1 Thess. 5: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For what purpose are these servants of God brought out of darkness into the light? The Scriptures answer : “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” (1 Pet. 2:9) Therefore God has put into the mind and heart of every one of his truly devoted servants this prayer: “0 send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me.” (Ps. 43:3) The Lord sends his willing servants amongst the people to show them the light of the truth in order that they may find the way to salvation and serve righteousness. We have now come to the time when Christ Jesus the King is enthroned and at the temple, and the faithful servants of God hear his commandment, to wit: “Arise, shine; for thy light [The King] is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.”—Isa. 60:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The person who has made a solemn covenant to do the will of Jehovah God, and who has been accepted by Jehovah and made His servant and the servant of Christ, must thenceforth devote himself wholly to the Lord and be a witness to the name and to the kingdom of Jehovah God, and must go forth to preach this gospel of the Kingdom in obedience to the Lord’s commandment. He could not do otherwise and be faithful to his covenant with Jehovah. The name of Jehovah and the name of his King and his kingdom must be declared, and this work must be done by Jehovah’s witnesses; and concerning them it is written in the Scriptures: “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!”—Rom. 10:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the sight of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus such faithful witnesses are beautiful, not from the physical viewpoint, but because of the beauty of their faithfulness in performing their duty as commanded. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tn</span><span class="font5"> the eyes of Satan and his religious agents Jehovah’s witnesses are anything but beautiful, and are hated by all such because they do proclaim the name and the kingdom of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such is the work that is carried forward by the body of Christians called Jehovah’s witnesses. The corporations above named do the printing and manufacturing, and the faithful men and women devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom go forward to bear testimony to the name of the Most High and to his kingdom. The motive for so doing is love, that is to say, unselfish devotion to Jehovah, to his King, and to his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year of 1940 Jehovah’s witnesses have been subjected to great and cruel persecution, which to some degree has retarded the volume of their work, but which persecution has increased their zeal and devotion to The Theocracy and strengthened their determination to carry on, by the grace of the Lord, until the work is done. They see clearly that the “strange work” of Jehovah is drawing near to an end and that his “strange act” will quickly follow and that then full and complete deliverance will be their portion. They have every reason, therefore, to rejoice, and they do rejoice, pressing on in the performance of their commission regardless of all opposition that comes in their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Herein is set out a brief report of the work done in various countries of the earth. Because of the totalitarian and religious rule of the many countries of Europe it is impossible in this year’s report to give a complete statement of what has been done. Faithful witnesses in those countries continue to go on with the work of witnessing to the Lord, but they must do it under such a handicap that their reports come only in piecemeal. The faithful servants of God will read excerpts from their reports herein set out with a real joy and satisfaction, and they will thereby be encouraged to continuously press on in the service of the great Theocracy until the great Theocrat and his King shall say, “It is done!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>ORDAINED MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, at its offices in Brooklyn, keeps a list of men who are made the special representatives of the Society and to whom is assigned specific work. These men are representatives of the Society, and all of them are ordained ministers of the gospel. They have received the divine ordination or commission of authority from Jehovah God, as herein set forth, and they have also been appointed and commissioned by the Society as ministers of this gospel of the Kingdom, to look well to certain specific duties assigned to them. There are many other ordained ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses, and who represent the Society, whose names do not appear in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> but who have evidence of their ordination and their position with the Society.

<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>AMERICA (U.S.)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The executive offices of the corporations hereinbefore named are maintained at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn. The chief operating offices and factory are at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn. The office and factory force, while small in number when compared to the duties performed, are earnest, zealous, trustworthy, faithful and hard workers, giving attention to the “goods” of the Lord. All of them render their services voluntarily and without compensation except food and shelter and a small amount, $10.00 per month, for incidental expenses furnished by the Society. They work regularly five and one-half days of the week at the office or factory, and at stated times they work Saturday afternoon and evenings as will appear from the report below. Usually on Saturday afternoons and Sundays every one of that force and of the Bethel family engage in preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” by calling on the people and presenting to them the Kingdom message or otherwise carrying on the work of the Society. The motto of each one is: ‘This one thing I do: Forgetting the things that are behind, I press forward to advertise The Theocracy.’ Every working hour is fully occupied by these faithful servants of God. When the day’s work at the office, factory or Bethel home is completed, they attend or lead Bible studies at various points in New York and vicinity. They engage in giving instruction in the Word of God* All these Bible studies that are held in and about the city of New York and elsewhere are led by ordained ministers competent and apt to teach. These call on the people in the evenings at their homes, and where there is a group in any vicinity desiring to organize a study class this is done and a competent person is appointed from amongst the ordained ministers to conduct and lead and instruct such class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bethel family includes all of those at 124 Columbia Heights, at Watchtower, and at the Farms. All of these are doing one and the same thing, to wit, preaching the gospel and incidentally doing that which is necessary to carry on the work. They are God’s ministers and servants, and they delight to serve him day and night. There has never been another organization of men on earth like those who are now engaged in proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom. The time has come in which they must be at</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">unity, and they are at unity and all looking forward with great expectancy and joy of heart to the day of deliverance that the Lord will bring to those on this earth who love righteousness and hate iniquity. By faith they see the Kingdom is here and the blessings for which sincere persons have hoped and prayed for for centuries past are now about to be fully realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every servant acting under the direction of the Society makes report to the Executive Department of the organization. From the report made by the office servant at 117 Adams St. the following facts are set forth, and which will be read with keen interest and great joy by all who love The Theocracy :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have just finished the busiest and most blessed year of our lives. For this we are grateful and give thanks to Jehovah, the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As we approach quite near to the final battle the Lord has been very good to his people in that he has refreshed us with a bountiful table of both spiritual and physical food so that we could carry on an even greater schedule of work than ever before, as outlined for his people through the Lord’s organization. The Lord’s hand can be seen clearly in the outworking of his purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everything manufactured in the past twelve months was shipped out immediately to the publishers in the field. In order to keep up with the call for more of the Kingdom message in printed form it was necessary to increase the factory and office force to 160 persons. Not only was this increase necessary, but the usual day’s work, which begins at 8 every morning and ends at 5: 45 in the evening, did not meet the situation; so during the year we worked additionally 75 evenings from 7 to 9: 30, as well as 16 Saturday afternoons. The regular working schedule is 5^ days a week, allowing Saturday afternoon and Sunday for field service. Second shifts on certain machines, particularly the presses, were arranged for nearly three weeks so as to keep up with the printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason for all this extra time in the factory can be appreciated by the following report, which shows that over a million more bound books were made than a year ago. Also the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine campaign of this past year was cause for increased production. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font5"> new high peak of 7,215,600 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> were printed and mailed out during the year. Two years ago, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> printing requirement was only 1,609,200. That means a tremendous volume of new work. The people of good-will were glad to receive the life-giving truths contained therein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The volume of work listed above required 3,022 tons of various kinds of paper. In the completion of the bound books there were also used 181 tons of chip board, 249,332 yards of cloth, 3,400 rolls of gold tape, 41,550 yards of crash, 737 spools of thread, and other supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other materials made in our own factory and used in the manufacture of books and phonographs were 35,394 pounds of ink, 120 barrels of paste, and 15,375 pounds of glue. During the year we began making our own gelatin press rollers for our high-speed presses rather than buy from an outside firm, thus reducing expenses 290 gallons of paint and 50 pounds of putty were made for the repair of buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of the material used to manufacture the publications listed above would require a train of more than 165 cars (20 tons each). This was brought into the factory, put through the various operations, and then sent out in the form of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Machinery</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If it had not been for the purchase of a new highspeed rotary press that was bought at the direction of the president of the Society it would have been impossible to print the 7 million copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">during the past year, with the equipment on hand. On November 15, 1939, this new press went into operation, replacing an older model. This press prints in two colors and stitches </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> at the speed of 12,000 completed magazines an hour. When not printing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> the same press can be used for the printing of books or booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another great time-saver was the purchase of a new continuous trimmer, installed in May, 1940. The constant increase of magazine distribution and also the production of books and booklets made it necessary to install the very latest device for trimming the publications. This trimmer is an automatic, self-feeding machine, with many safety devices for the protection of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other improvements directed by the president to be made were the installation of another invoicing machine, a flat shaving machine for the plate department, and an additional phone system for intercommunication between departments. All these improvements made, at considerable expense to the Society, added greatly to the efficiency and to meeting the need of better and more publication for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Shipments</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shipping department has had one of its biggest years in the dispatching of literature and other Kingdom material. There was a marked increase in the shipment of bound books over that of previous years. This was due to the great demand for the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font5"> which took the lead over any other individual bound book shipped; namely, 1,266,286 were shipped out in the English language. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> released at the convention in July, has reached 923,926 copies shipped up to September 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shipments of bound books for 1940 were greater than the production, as there were 206,792 more bound books sent out of the shipping department than we were able to make. While the demand for booklets was exceedingly heavy, upward of 22| million, we were able to manufacture approximately 2 million more. The heavy drain on bound books this year was because of the fast movement of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> coming to the close of the year. The report below on English and foreign publications shipped to all parts of the world is most interesting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">New publications always tax the full capacity of the shipping department. During the year we received the 1940 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font5"> and later </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span><span class="font5"> Booklets that were released were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Neutrality, Refugees, Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column, Conspiracy Against Democracy, Model Study</span><span class="font5"> No. 2, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font5"> was shipped out to the amount of 9,019,490 copies in both English and foreign languages. The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column</span><span class="font5"> started through the factory on June 28, and in but three months 5,523,322 have already gone out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> will undoubtedly have the greatest circulation of any bound book within the next few years because of the unprecedented demands for this volume at its start. At the close of the fiscal year we were three weeks behind on filling orders totaling several hundred thousand copies. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, </span><span class="font5">which was released in June, 1939, has now reached its 2| million edition, and still the demand is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It cost the Society during the past year to ship out all of its books, booklets and magazines, a total of $154,633.12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Shipments of Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren who work in the phonograph department are also capable of working in the book bindery, and according to the press of work brethren are transferred from one place to the other. Demand for literature was so great that full time could not be devoted to making phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At no time during the year were we caught up on orders for phonographs, but it was possible for us to ship 8,260. In addition thereto we shipped 3 sound car equipments. It is our hope to fill all orders on the old-model phonograph by November 1, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new model of the phonograph was introduced at the convention. Fifty demonstrators were placed with the publishers for regular use. During the coming year we expect to make shipment of this new, vertical type. When we finish production on the old-model phonographs we shall have made, at the Brooklyn factory alone, 43,000 of these sound machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Recordings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Phonograph records containing short talks and complete lectures made by the president of the Society occupy considerable space in our shipping department. The shipment of records during the year in the English language totaled 102,194 discs. These were doublefaced, which is equal to 204,388 recordings of 4| minutes each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tn</span><span class="font5"> addition thereto there were 12,004 discs shipped nut in foreign tongues; also 2,643 musical quartet records made by the Society. The grand total of discs dispatched was 116,841. The distribution of records this year was lower than for the previous year, due to the fact that no new recordings were made until late in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new recordings of the year were the 1940 Special, “The End” (P-219-P-230), and “Religion” (P-231-P-248).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1940 Special record was used to advertise the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, and 15,000 of these were shipped throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The lectures, “The End” and “Religion”, were simultaneously recorded while the president of the Society delivered the lectures “Times and Seasons” and “Religion as a World Remedy”. These are the finest recordings ever made for us, and shipment of the same just began at the close of the fiscal year. The first order placed with the manufacturer for these new recordings amounted to 130,000 double-faced discs, some of which have already been shipped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers are well supplied with lectures that will answer all questions on Bible subjects, and the people of good-will are eager to hear them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the use of phonograph records has become one of the most important means of advertising the King and the Kingdom, 933,309 double-faced discs have been distributed throughout the world through the Brooklyn office in the past few years. No wonder the enemy continues to howl! Many of these have been run so often that the publishers had to replace them with new supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publication</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witnesses of The Theocracy clearly discern from the “signs of the times” that the hour is rapidly approaching when the “sign” of Armageddon will be clearly revealed, and all who are on the side of Jehovah will appreciate and greatly rejoice in it. These witnesses of the Kingdom show their joy and abiding confidence in the great Theocrat and his kingdom by giving greater diligence to the work entrusted to their care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work in the United States has gone ahead during 1940 at a pace never exceeded, and that has brought down the wrath of the religionists upon the witnesses of Jehovah as never before. In spite of the most intense opposition and persecution ever experienced by the Lord’s people in the United States, the witness for Jehovah and The Theocratic Government has been greater than at any time in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many outstanding events for the year 1940, such as the great increase in publishers, the millions of hours these spent in the field work, the use of sound equipment, the wide distribution of literature and magazines; all of which makes this the greatest witness ever given in this land. The reason for the tremendous increase in publishers, which reached a peak of 58,009 in June, can be attributed to the fact, first, that the Lord is gathering the “multitude” and, second, those who have been sharing in the -witness work have been feeding the people of good-will to the end that they may clearly see the Kingdom and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A year ago there was an average of 35,466 publish<sub>7 </sub>ers in the field every month, but in the past twelve months this average reached 47,762 regular publishers. Not only have the ranks of company publishers increased, but the pioneer publishers went away ahead of any previous record. These have not slacked their hand. The Lord prospered his organization. They have shown forth their faith by their work, and, they having an eye single to His glory and being blind to everything else, Jehovah showered upon them his blessing. This blessing is revealed by the following figures:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The hours reported in the field, witnessing door-to-door, making back-calls, handling model studies, and distributing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> and folders, total 12,256,724 hours. In these millions of hours the Kingdom of Jehovah was well advertised, and it surpasses any other year by more than 3,100,000 hours of service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the most outstanding things in the field report are interesting to review. The placement of bound books exceeded by far the distribution of bound books of the previous year. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> was released in June, 1939, and by the “Theocracy” Testimony Period, which began October 1, was going at full speed as to distribution. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> was one that the publishers had a great desire to place in the hands of the people of good-will, and, by the Lord’s grace, they did. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> although only released in July and having a distribution only during August and September, added considerably to this tremendous output of bound books. By the end of the year the shipments from Brooklyn to companies and pioneers reached 600,000 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The division between the “sheep” and the “goats” is becoming more marked. Not much time is wasted on the goats; they manifest themselves quickly. While there is a decrease in the combined total of books and booklets placed, this is more than offset by the new work which began in February of this past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Magazine distribution. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine has played one of the most important parts in the witness for the year. In February, for the first time, street-corner work with magazines and publishers’ establishing route deliveries for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> were begun. The report from the field shows that individual magazines to the amount of nearly three million copies were distributed in this manner; this in addition to the regular distribution of books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the month of May, at various points throughout the country, mob action, led by religionists, tried to beat down these magazine publishers and scare them from their positions of duty. By June, from coast to coast the Catholic Hierarchy, through their subsidiary agency, the un-American Legion, began an onslaught of brutal mob action. These demonized people, led by priests, preachers, Legionnaires and local officials, viciously attacked our brethren, threw them into filthy prisons, destroyed their equipment, wrecked their halls and homes, set fire to their trailers and house-cars, drove them out of cities, tarred and feathered them, and restored Catholic Inquisition in America. This gang of cutthroats was well supported by the “Free Press” in lying stories about Jehovah’s witnesses, accusing them of being Nazis, Communists, Fifth Columnists. Some honest-hearted people could read between the lines, and the “wrath of men” has done something to awaken more of the people to the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">'Dividing the People.” That is what was happening in the United States. A special leaflet was prepared by the president of the Society to distribute in all of these towns where mob action took place. </span><span class="font5">The brethren who were mobbed went right back into these towns and left a copy of the “Dividing the People” folder at every home. Hundreds of thousands of copies of these were put out in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From coast to coast one of the greatest campaigns of informing all the people of the vicious action by the Hierarchy was accomplished through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> Nos. 5 and 6. Upward of 17 million copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> were distributed, and it opened the eyes of many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back-calls and Model Studies were the one instrument that greatly helped the people of good-will to see the difference between religion and Christianity. The lecture “Government and Peace”, which showed the viciousness of the Hierarchy and their efforts to break up peaceful assemblies, was used far and wide in back-calls and model studies. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklet No. 2 was provided for the publishers and found to be a great help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the brethren made 1,975,377 back-calls ; and this meant putting to good use their sound equipment and the hundreds of thousands of records that are scattered throughout the country ready for the publishers to run for those who have a hearing ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Battle Siege” Testimony Period was indeed a siege around “Christendom”. This testimony period was the beginning of a world-wide campaign, and it resulted in the obtaining of thousands of new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscribers, to whom now regularly go the lifegiving truths as set forth in that journal. It added stimulus to the street-corner work with magazines as well. During the year the publishers of the Kingdom obtained new subscriptions to the number of 101,188 for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was during June that a petition swept the country. The “Locust Army” Testimony Period was winding up the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign, and it came as a great shock to all the publishers of the Kingdom that the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses might not be held at the Ohio State Fair Grounds. The <sup>C£</sup>locust” army went to work as they never did before, and within the period of just a few days 2,042,136 persons signed this petition, which was presented to the governor of Ohio. Right on top of this petition came the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column,</span><span class="font5"> and this took the country by storm. Two million copies were printed during day and night shifts, and shipped to all parts of the country for distribution July 13 and for ten days thereafter. These two million booklets were put in the hands of the people prior to the convention, which was finally held at Detroit, Michigan. This activity prior to the convention was a delight to every publisher and was another means of releasing some prisoners from the prison houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers of The Theocracy have enjoyed the battle which ensued during the year, and, by the Lord’s grace, will continue fighting the devilish horde until this gospel of the Kingdom is completely preached as the Lord would have it done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers are enjoying the rich blessing of the Lord, and the Theocratic organization has looked well to their interests in giving them special credits on their accounts during the year so as to aid them to keep in the work. Pioneers in many parts of the country battled alone in isolated territory against entrenched servants of wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special effort was put forth during the year, through a series of letters, to point out to Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, the importance of engaging in the pioneer work, and the results are most gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The number of pioneers reporting in the fall of 1939 was 2,292, but one year later, in 1940, there were 3,157 pioneers engaging in the field service. Many have signed up as pioneers since the convention who have enrolled but as yet have not reported, but the number of pioneers enrolled at the close of the fiscal year totaled 3,879. These brethren are putting their full time in die witness work. Many of them during the past year have enjoyed the privilege of establishing new companies, this accomplished by continual back-call and model-study work in the evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there was an average of 2,686 fulltime publishers in the field. This included zone and regional servants and pioneers, and these brethren alone put 3,607,765 hours in the field work. They made nearly 600,000 back-calls, and had an attendance of 3,731,193 persons hearing the lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Organization. The divine supervision and the wisdom of Jehovah were clearly in evidence in the preparation of the Theocratic organization during the past two years. If it had not been for this closely knitted co-operation between the various branches of the service, undoubtedly the severe opposition and persecution upon the Lord’s people would have had a demoralizing effect and would have caused confusion in the ranks of the Lord’s people; but, instead of that, the organization continues in spite of the most severe persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The regional servants, zone servants and special pioneers in many cases bore the brunt of this attack. In many instances the enemy learned of zone assemblies and caused mobs to attack the Lord’s people when assembled. By the Lord’s grace and help the servants appointed by the Society, and who were taking the lead in the witness work, held firm to their ground even though they encountered the most ferocious attack. They maintained such a fearless and aggressive Theocratic stand that they were a great help to the other brethren to see the issue clearly and to maintain their position as representatives of the Most High God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The general organization of the companies is found to be far better than several years ago. The pioneers and company publishers are co-operating one with the other in looking after those who are interested. Zone servants were able to assist pioneers in the establishment of companies in many isolated places and the work of the Lord prospers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year 155 zone servants served 7,531 companies. That means that the 2,815 companies were each served several times during the year. There are 5 regional servants, who served 265 zones, and 5 Bethel regional servants, who served 49 zone assemblies. There was a total of 314 zone assemblies during the year. The zone and regional servants during the year traveled a total of 2,121,410 miles in visiting and serving companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are now well over 100,000 persons throughout this country who are studying regularly with Jehovah’s witnesses the books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and attending model studies, all seeking the way to life. Last March, at Memorial time, 58,874 persons attended the celebration of the King’s Memorial and 15,873 partook of the emblems. The privileges that have been afforded the publishers in the United States during the past year cannot be compared with anything previously granted. The witness given in the interests of the Kingdom has been the greatest ever, and all shout with a clear note, “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Countries Reporting to Brooklyn Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 49 companies and 63 pioneers scattered in different parts of the world, mostly in the Western hemisphere, that report direct to the Brooklyn office. There are not sufficient publishers in those countries or territories to establish a branch. Their activity during the past twelve months shows an increase over previous years as to publishers and hours in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These isolated brethren did exceedingly well in their back-call work, doubling that of the previous year. Back-calls totaled 18,009, and the attendance at these back-calls, listening to the latest lectures of the president of the Society, was 367,503. A combined report of the 19 countries or islands is herewith set out, as well as a short report for the different groups mentioned.</span></p>

Her placements of literature were good; so good, in fact, that it seriously injured the susceptibilities of some of the authorities, disturbing their “peacefulness and quietude”. But before the pioneer left, quite a number were informed about the biggest racket on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An additional company was started in Nevis near the end of the fiscal year. The work goes ahead in the West Indies, the pioneers accounting for most of the placements. In the Bahamas, while there has been no increase in number of publishers, the company continues to do good work, engaging in the various branches of the service outlined in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The lone pioneer in Guadeloupe has been active during the entire year, continuing to uphold the standards of The Theocracy there. Considerable interest is being manifested by those of good-will. Studies are being held regularly and an effort is being made to organize a company, although it is becoming more difficult to carry on the work in this French island possession.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It will be interesting to note the special effort put forth by the family in order to supply the conven-tioners with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> and also to get a good supply of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column</span><span class="font5"> in the hands of the publishers prior to their vacation period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the month of July there were only 17 working days prior to the convention, and in these 17 days, including the night work, the brethren were able to complete 250,667 bound books and 3,389,482 booklets. In addition to this they printed and shipped 1,299,000 magazines. This 17-day period is the best period of production that the brethren have ever enjoyed. The fruits of their labor are now seen in the tremendous witness being given with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bethel family had a full share of the convention activity, each being assigned a specific duty, for which they were grateful. They were very thankful, too, for the president’s arrangement of an extra week after the convention to rest a little and do witnessing in the countryside with the Kingdom message. All of the family gained strength and some weight and returned joyfully to their service at the Bethel home and factory after this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hierarchy continues its proud saying, “We put Judge Rutherford off the air.” The facts of the matter are that the Society has not even attempted to arrange a radio hookup in the last year. Many radio stations throughout the country would be only too glad if Judge Rutherford would continue his broadcasts, but the Lord has directed that other methods be used to convey the Kingdom message to the people. Many radio stations that had regularly carried Judge Rutherford’s talks were threatened with boycott and coercion by the Hierarchy, but they themselves gave these stations very little business unless it was free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instead of using the recorded speeches of Judge Rutherford on the radio, attention was directed to their use by phonograph. 11| million persons have heard by this means, and it was difficult for the Hierarchy to boycott or coerce individuals not to hear these lectures brought to them on the phonograph. The only way they could attempt to cope with the situation was to institute mob action. While the radio has done a splendid work in times past in exposing the Hierarchy, the phonograph activity now is cutting even deeper into the guts of the “old lady” and exposing her dirt and wicked machinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WBBR, Brooklyn, New York, continues to carry regularly Brother Rutherford’s lectures, to the delight of thousands of listeners throughout the Greater New York area. A few other stations throughout the country are also broadcasting the short five-minute talks, and this at their own request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Visits</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On January 20, 1940, Brother Rutherford wrote a letter to the “Publishers of The Theocracy” in which was pointed out the need of making back-calls, also the importance of arranging for model studies. This letter has aided the brethren much in seeing their responsibility, and they have gone forward with greater zeal in this form of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year it was arranged to publish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklet No. 2, which the brethren have found to be a great help. It was necessary to print 411,335 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklets to supply the year’s demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thousands upon thousands of complete sets of “Government and Peace” lectures have been distributed all over the country, in fact, in all parts of the world, and these have been used regularly every week in connection with model studies. This lecture has opened the eyes of many to see their responsibility and take a definite stand for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest number of back-calls ever made were made during the past year by the publishers, the total being 1,975,377. The reports show that 29,280 phonographs are being used regularly in the field and that the lectures, such as “Government and Peace”, &quot;Victory,” “Fill the Earth,” “Fascism or Freedom,” and others, have been heard by 11,645,689 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In making personal visits the publishers have opportunity to answer questions and to arrange for further back-calls and point out the advantage of model studies. Those brethren who have engaged in this field of work have found that the Lord had in store for them a rich blessing. All publishers of the Kingdom eventually will be doing this work and will find that it is one of the most important activities in the Theocratic organization that one can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Use of Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reports constantly come in from the publishers throughout the land stating, “I would not know what to do if I did not have my phonograph.” Some publishers actually feel tongue-tied if something happens to their phonograph and they can’t use it. English and foreign-speaking publishers alike who have used the phonograph find real joy in its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The doorstep setup has been a wonderful help in bringing forcefully to the minds of persons the importance of the Truth. The short lecture which we now have, “Message of Hope,” presents the issue forcefully to the listener. The “Snare and Backet” record, the “Convention” record, and the “Instruction” record were all used to good advantage in this respect during the past year. Undoubtedly the new record “The Message of Hope” and Part 11 of “The End” will be even more effective in this respect, because of the forceful presentation and the enthusiastic response by the audience receiving the message. This should take well in the doorstep setup and should open up the way for many back-calls and model studies, as well as placing a considerable number of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 248 recordings in the English language which we now have have done more to aid the people of goodwill in getting a proper understanding of the Bible than any other one thing. These records used in connection with the model study have shown people of good-will how to use their Bibles and the books, by looking up the scriptures and referring to the index.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are now on the list 86 special pioneers. These special pioneers are brethren appointed by the Society to act as assistants to zone servants or full-time company servants. It has been found during the past year that many of the larger companies needed a full-time, well-qualified brother to look after the interests of the work in thickly populated territories. These special pioneers have been a great assistance in the development of the organization and have closely co-operated with the zone servants in furthering the Kingdom interests in various sections of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These special pioneers have in many instances assisted greatly in showing newer brethren in the companies how to handle the work, and then these special pioneers have been transferred to other cities to carry on similar activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special pioneer fully appreciates the need of using the phonograph in the doorstep setup, back-calls and model studies. He sees and tries to convey to the brethren the importance of putting in many hours in the field service, placing the literature in the hands of the people, engaging in magazine work and assisting all who show good-will toward the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order for these brethren to look after the details of the companies as well as carry on their pioneer activity the Society assisted them financially during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special pioneers are selected from among men on the pioneer list who are now devoting full time to the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the greatest pleasures the publishers receive in the year is to learn of the announcement of a new publication coming out and then to obtain that publication and read it. New publications always add stimulus to the work. The receiving of new publications • constantly through the Lord’s organization shows that Jehovah causes his light to shine more and more unto the perfect day, and as he does this it is important to take to the people of good-will these truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The biggest surprise of the year, and one that brought forth a great shout of joy amidst tremendous enthusiasm, was the release of the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> at the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. This moment will never be forgotten, and the recording of the release of this book in part eleven of the lecture series “The End” always brings a thrill to one when he hears it. People listening to this record feel as though they have to take the book because of such enthusiasm demonstrated at the time of its initial release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column</span><span class="font5"> brought about as much excitement among the brethren as anything we have ever had, and the initial consignments of this booklet to all companies throughout the United States, which were around two million, were put out within the first few days of the announcement of the campaign. This new booklet, along with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> cuts deep into the vitals of “Eglon”. These publications, like all others put out by the Society, hit the mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the very close of the year </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy was</span><span class="font5"> published, containing the two lectures of the president of the Society given at the Detroit convention. These were eagerly awaited by the publishers, and the campaign for world-wide distribution began October 1. By the time the year ended the Society had already printed and dispatched 2,596,000 copies of this new publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other publications released during the year were the booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Neutrality, Advice for Kingdom Publishers, Model Study</span><span class="font5"> No. 2, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees. Refugees</span><span class="font5"> made the hearts of many glad, and in a short period of time it was necessary to print more than 9 million copies in the English and foreign languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font5"> is a publication enjoyed daily by those who love Jehovah. A large edition of this book was printed this past year, 55,000 volumes being made. By the latter part of the year this book was out of stock and many of those who have taken their stand for the Kingdom in the past few months have been desirous of getting a copy. Very likely a larger quantity will be printed for next year. The report by the president and the daily texts and comments have all brought much comfort to the servants of the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses was held July 24-28, 1940, despite the efforts of the Devil, his horde of demons, and visible agents trying to keep Jehovah’s witnesses from assembling together. The Theocratic Convention was the most glorious and blessed assembly ever held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Rutherford opened the convention, and his opening remarks, based on Isaiah 59: 1, were most appropriate and undoubtedly were the expression of the thousands in attendance. The words were' these: “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For months the Lord’s servants had petitioned their Father, and on this opening day of the convention they could see clearly the Lord’s hand in directing the affairs of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;What occurred at that convention will never be forgotten, because the witness that began there is now being carried to the ends of the earth. The president of the Society was very ill and under the care of physicians, and it seemed most likely to those who knew of his condition that it would not be possible for him to attend unless the Lord performed a miracle. This Jehovah did, and he was able to address the convention on three different occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His opening speech of the convention was a delightful occasion as he reviewed the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses for the past few months as related to their present work and arrangements for the country-wide Theocratic convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. It was a stirring address, the Theocracy was magnified and the entrenched enemies of the King were exposed. It was brought out that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, through the American Legion, its present bedfellow, under the guise of patriotism, was carrying on mob action and that they had caused the canceling of many of the 34 conventions that were to be tied in with the key city. Those who do not fall in line with the Hierarchy’s racket were forced out of halls; literature was burned; they were run out of town; and this action went from coast to coast until they had succeeded in breaking contracts of 16 convention halls. In their proud, arrogant spirit they felt they could succeed in smashing through on the 18 other conventions arranged, but in this they failed. The Lord’s people had put their trust in Jehovah. The hand of Jehovah was not shortened. The prayers of His people were answered and, despite much opposition at every convention city, arrangements were made for the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. In many places, even up to the last minute the brethren were not sure just where to go, what conventions were being held, but, having faith in the Lord, they came to Detroit and the 17 other assemblies and enjoyed every session up to and including the last day, when the climax of the convention was reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The lecture on “Times and Seasons”, delivered before 35,000 witnesses at Detroit alone, was one that thrilled the hearts of all who heard, because “Times and Seasons” brought so forcefully before all of us “the sign” that would mark the final battle. At the conclusion of this talk there was exhibited for the first time the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> and to try to describe what occurred throughout the convention at Detroit and the 17 other auditoriums tied in by direct wire connection in the country would be impossible, but the simultaneous recordings made of this lecture reveal to some extent the joy, the gladness, and the enthusiasm wherewith this book was received. If you could add to this the delight and brilliance that shone from the faces of the audience, then you could get some picture of the joy that filled the souls of those attending the first Theocratic Convention. Immediately after this lecture nearly 30,000 copies of the autographed edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> were placed with the conventioners in all parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without question the Lord wanted delivered, without interference, the wonderful speech “Religion as a World Remedy”. This lecture was simultaneously recorded, and is the finest recording we have at this time. Religion was given the worst beating it ever had. It was exposed from every angle. The hirelings of religion were dragged out in the open, and the dirt and corruption of this wicked organization was made plain to see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1928 the declaration went forth at Detroit against the Devil and for the Lord, and since that time there has been a very marked increase in the opposition against the truth by the Devil and all of his organization. It seems evident that the Lord would have His people return to that city, the stronghold of “Father” Coughlin and the home of American Legion Commander Kelly, and have delivered such an expression against the Devil’s crowd as was done on July 28. 45,000 people packed out the Convention Hall and Eastern Star Temple, thousands being in the streets and exit points listening to loud-speakers. Private lines took the talk to a trailer camp, “Jehovah Village” the newspapers called it, where 12,000 persons heard this lecture. Simultaneously in 17 other cities 35,000 were assembled, making a total of nearly 80,000 persons that were listening to this expose of religion. It was a joyful occasion never to be forgotten, and the Lord’s people are grateful that they can use these recordings along with the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy,</span><span class="font5"> which contains “Times and Seasons” and “Religion as a World Remedy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were other highlights of the convention, such as the pioneer meeting, model service meeting, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, the introduction of a new vertical-type phonograph which will facilitate the use of records in the doorstep setup, and many timely lectures all based on recent </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The organization of the convention was a mystery to the businessmen of the city; everything moved along so smoothly and was operated by the brethren. We had our own cafeteria, book room, refreshment stands, trailer camp, housing committee, service department, and ushering staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not pacifists, and, when it comes to the protection of the Kingdom interests, these they will protect with their lives, and undoubtedly the hoodlums and strong-arm squad of the Hierarchy recognized this on the faces of the stalwart ushers. Jehovah's witnesses learned considerable from the Madison Square Garden experience and are grateful to the Lord for making their position dear through the Scriptures at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The incidents preparatory to the Theocratic Convention have been covered in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font5"> which contains a detailed report of all conventions, but, in summary, it might be stated that for months great preparations were made to hold the convention at Columbus, Ohio. Tens of thousands of dollars were spent in advertising and preparing for this assembly at the Ohio State Fair Grounds, but the Hierarchy dictated to the officials of the state and put fear in their hearts and they yielded to the influence of the 'old whore’. (Revelation 17:1) Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the country circulated a petition and within a few days’ time obtained 2,042,136 signers demanding Governor Bricker and the Ohio State Fair Grounds Association to allow Jehovah’s witnesses use of the Fair Grounds for their Christian assembly. Governor Bricker ingloriously refused to honor the petitioners’ request, but took sides with the pope of Rome, much to the delight of the American Hierarchy and Legion. On page 12-C of the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> October 11, 1940, many months later, this interesting news item appears: &quot;Legion Head Names Aide. Indianapolis, Oct. 10 (AP)—Milo J. Warner, new National Commander of the American Legion, announced today the appointment of Joe Duetsehle of Columbus, Ohio, as his aide.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Efforts were then made in many of the larger cities of the country to obtain halls of sufficient capacity to take care of a convention of the magnitude of Jehovah’s witnesses, but by this time, late in June, the American Legion under Catholic direction was sweeping the country with patriotic fervor, crying that Jehovah’s witnesses were Communists, Nazis, Fifth Column, and scaring most city officials into withholding their auditoriums. The Lord maneuvered the situation so that Convention Hall at Detroit could be had; but tremendous pressure was brought to bear by the local Legion and the Hierarchy up to the last to break up this meeting and cancel the contract that had previously been paid in full. Neither the Hierarchy nor the Legion had more than hardly awakened to the fact that we were going into Convention Hall until we had already moved in and had taken possession of it and were making preparations for the assembly. It was necessary to have a large guard of many brethren twenty-four hours a day to protect the property prior to the convention assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses came to the convention, they were blessed, and returned home knowing full well that it was good to have been there. They received a blessing from the Lord which was overflowing Everyone attending the convention had some share in the proclamation of the Kingdom, distributing handbills, and putting out literature, which literature totaled 291,998 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> No. 6 also was released at the convention, and more than two million copies of this were taken home by the brethren for immediate distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Representatives of practically every type of magazine and newspaper reporters, special writers and photographers attended the convention in large numbers because of the intense persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the country and the interest in them manifested by the people generally. This has resulted in the greatest publicity that Jehovah’s witnesses have ever had in the public press, and since the convention they have been kept prominently before the eyes of the people and many of good-will are now seeking to get the truth about Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of advertising the King and the Kingdom goes grandly on as Jehovah maneuvers everything which, in the end, will divide all the sheep from the goats, and His name and Word will be glorified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">International Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twice a year the Society compiles a report of all countries during special testimony periods. The first international testimony period for the year was that of October, the “Theocracy” Testimony Period, which was a most fitting title for a world-wide campaign. During this period there were 73,469 publishers in 55 countries engaged in the field work world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next world-wide campaign began in April with the “Battle Siege” Testimony Period, and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine along with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> was the leading offer to the people. This special campaign ran for a period of three months, concluding with “Locust Army” Testimony Period, in June. During these three months the report shows that 90,674 different publishers, in 53 countries, engaged in the field service; this despite the fact that most European countries were at war and the work closed down in many sections of the world. The witness during this period was one of the greatest ever given to the honor of Jehovah’s name and in the interests of The Theocracy. While we did not surpass any records in the placement of literature, the number of hours devoted to witnessing for the King and the Kingdom reached a new high of 5,672,705 hours. The complete report of these two international testimony periods is compiled below.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Report t&gt;n Special Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Calendar published by the Society designates certain months, six in number, as Testimony Periods. These were entitled “Theocracy”, “War of Vindication,” “Salvation,” “Battle Siege,” “Locust Army,” and “Religion’s Doom”. All of these months were devoted to special campaigns, and it was suggested by the Society that extra efforts be put forth during these periods to increase the activity, if at all possible. The people of good-will do not slack their hand from one month to the next, but see the importance of consistent service for the King, and to many of the regular publishers, as far as hours are concerned, there is very little difference between the hours of a testimony-period month and that of other months, for all of their time is devoted to the Lord. The brethren prefer to speak of the various months in the terms of “Testimony Periods”, the names given by the Theocratic organization, rather than by the names of the months which appear on the calendar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The six regions into which the United States has been divided are served by regional servants. There are zone assemblies arranged twice a year, and in each region there are approximately 25 zones served by the regional servant. At the present time there are 153 zones, each zone having a zone servant. The Society appoints all of these ordained ministers to the zones. Their duty is that of looking well to the interests of God’s kingdom, admonishing the brethren and giving them instruction in the Word of the Lord. These servants of Jehovah make regular reports to the Society concerning the progress of work carried on by their Christian associates in fulfilling their mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year 1940 has been the most severe thus far from the standpoint of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the fact that the United States Supreme Court had previously ruled (in the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">City of Griffin)</span><span class="font5"> that no type of law could be applied to stop the Kingdom work, the year began with an increasing number of arrests and prosecutions under eity ordinances in many towns throughout the country in attempts to 'frame mischief by law' under a great variety of false charges, and to hamper and interfere with further proclamation of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the fall of 1939 counsel for Jehovah’s witnesses (the Society’s president) argued the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Schneider</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Town of Irvington</span><span class="font5"> (New Jersey) before the United States Supreme Court, and subsequently the Lord gave His people a victory in that case and caused the Supreme Court to plainly state that all kinds of ordinances aimed or used to interfere with the distribution of literature were invalid. Notwithstanding this clear mandate, the lower courts in many parts of the land continued to misapply their loeal ordinances, and when confronted with the Supreme Court opinions they would state, 'The Supreme Court doesn’t rule here; we have our own laws to enforce, and we are going to enforce them’; and thereby they deliberately flaunted the Constitution and the rulings of the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This totalitarian practice of judges violating their oaths of office to support the Constitution and convicting innocent persons in face of such strong opinions by the nation’s highest court has proved to be the clear result of influence exerted by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the real supporters of the Nazi-Fascist-Soviet combine of dictators in Europe. In many cases priests have actually appeared as accusers and witnesses against the Lord’s people. Many convictions have been obtained without any evidence at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the spring of 1940 the Lord caused the Supreme Court to give His people another victory in judicially approving Jehovah’s witnesses’ truthful attacks (by phonograph and otherwise) against religious principles advocated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">allied ecclesiastical institutions. In this case the Supreme Court for the first time passed favorably upon the question of freedom of worship as guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitutions. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cantwell</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Connecticut,</span><span class="font5"> 310 U. S. 296) In all former opinions that court had passed only upon the question of freedom of press. Victories given by the Lord in the eases of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell, Schneider,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cantwell,</span><span class="font5"> together with the continuous ‘pushing of the battle to the gate’ by Jehovah’s witnesses using the doorstep method with the phonograph, sound equipment and regular door-to-door witnessing, greatly enraged the enemy, causing them in their desperate anger to stir further persecution by increased arrests and prosecutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because the many hundreds of prosecutions did not deter the Lord’s people in singing the praises of Jehovah from door to door and on the streets, the enemy, acting under demon influence, caused violent opposition, in the form of mobs, against Kingdom publishers. This type of persecution renewed itself after a lapse of many years, beginning in a few instances in Pennsylvania and Ohio in the fall of 1939. Mob violence took a tremendous impetus in May, 1940, beginning at Del Rio, Texas, and spreading immediately to other small towns in Texas and many other states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On June 3, 1940, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that school boards may require children in publie schools to salute the flag or be exeluded. The publie press of the nation, under influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, greatly distorted this opinion, and falsely made it appear that every person </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">must </span><span class="font5">salute the flag. As a consequence of sueh distortion the un-American Legion under demon influence and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy thereafter fanned the already-kindled flame of mob violence which had broken out in Texas at its instance, and then mob violence spread rapidly to every state in the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since May, 1940, the Hierarchy and the American Legion, through such mobs that have taken the law into their own hands, violently worked havoe indescribable. Jehovah’s witnesses have been assaulted, beaten, kidnaped, driven out of towns, counties and states, tarred and feathered, forced to drink castor oil, tied together and chased like dumb beasts through the streets, castrated and maimed, taunted and insulted by demonized crowds, jailed by the hundreds without charge and held incommunicado and denied the privilege of conferring with relatives, friends or lawyers. Many other hundreds have been jailed and held in so-called “protective custody”; some have been shot in the nighttime; some threatened with hanging and beaten into unconsciousness. Numerous varieties of mob violence have occurred. Many have had their clothes torn from them, their Bibles and other literature seized and publicly burned; their automobiles, trailers, homes and assembly places wrecked and fired, resulting in damages totaling very many thousands of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This demonized violence has completely possessed the people and officials in hundreds of communities of America, so that they have falsely charged Jehovah’s witnesses with sedition and like crimes of being “against the government”. This character of persecution flared highest in Kentucky, Missouri and Indiana. In Kentucky ten brethren await trial for sedition, which carries a maximum penalty of twenty-one years in the penitentiary. In Indiana two harmless women have been convicted of “riotous conspiracy” because of possessing literature which the American Legion terms as being “against the government”, and have been sentenced to ten years in the penitentiary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In numerous instances where trials have been held in mob-ruled communities, lawyers as well as witnesses have been mobbed and beaten while attending court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In almost every case where there has been mob violence the public officials have stood idly by and refused to give protection, and in scores of instances the officers of the law have participated in the mobs and sometimes actually led the mobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time of writing this report (October, 1940) mob violence continues in almost every state in the Union. Because of fear of man, public officials refuse to prosecute those responsible for such violence. The Federal Department of Justice, through the solicitor general and J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI, has made public statements against mob violence and promised the Society’s representatives to take action under federal statutes against public officials participating in such mobs, but to date no prosecutions have been instituted against such wrongdoers. It may be that they never will take action, because of the strong influence of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s legal desk has handled scores of briefs in cases appealed, and, where convenient and of sufficient importance, has aided at trials. Thousands of letters have been answered, giving advice to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year two injunction suits in the United States District Courts have been successfully prosecuted, restraining local officials of two cities, in New Hampshire and New Jersey, from enforcing unconstitutional ordinances and arresting the brethren for engaging in the witness work. Several other such injunction suits have been instituted, and many others are contemplated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notwithstanding the fact that approximately two thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses have been assaulted and injured in about 600 mobs, and over 3,000 of them arrested, during the past year, they have fearlessly continued to call at the homes of the people with helpful Bible literature, and also offered such continuously each week upon the public streets, trusting in Jehovah for protection and deliverance from their enemies. Many reports show the Lord’s deliverance and protection of those who have boldly faced the enemy, in spite of threats of arrest and mob violence. In the midst of the storm of mob violence against the Lord’s people, the Detroit convention healed their wounds and injuries and brought encouragement and renewed zeal to all who attended, and greatly enabled them to return to their homes prepared for a bigger part in the fight to carry the Kingdom message to the meek. Mob violence experienced this year by Jehovah’s witnesses has strengthened instead of discouraged them, and the witness work goes on, greater than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The present nation-wide campaign of lies, slander and mob violence against Jehovah’s witnesses, pushed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the American Legion, is obviously the enemies’ smoke-screen to hide themselves, the real “fifth column”, in the attempt to grab control of the United States and rule it by a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">People of good-will today are making themselves more manifest than ever before and are truly hungering and thirsting after righteousness. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine is the only magazine published that will bring to the people the comfort and aid that the lovers of righteousness need. Under the direction of the Society special effort was put forth by the publishers to increase the distribution of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine. The past year finds that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">has enjoyed the greatest circulation ever, far exceeding any previous distribution. At the close of the year 1939 the regular mailing issue was up to 334,135; this for the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> alone. The combined distribution of the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> for the past twelve months, 7,072,125. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> was also mailed out from the Brooklyn office in the following languages: German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Ukrainian. The majority of these editions found an increase during the year, but towards the close of the year some of them were discontinued, namely, German and Hungarian. These were furnished through one of the European offices, but the war affects their importation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine is a journal of fact, hope and courage and has found a ready response amongst the people of America and other English-speaking countries. It does not, however, have as great a circulation as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> A year ago the regular mailing list called for 110,970 copies of each issue, whereas at the close of this year our regular mailing list was 230,491 copies. The combined circulation for twelve months aggregates 5,458,657 copies. Of this amount approximately one million were shipped out to foreign countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine during the last year was published in German, Greek, Polish, Spanish, Ukrainian. Due to European conditions these subscriptions have declined considerably, and towards the close of the year the German and Polish editions could no longer be sent to America from Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah, the great Theocrat, has granted us the privilege of devoting all our time and energy to the interests of God’s kingdom. Many are the expressions made throughout the year by the brethren here of our gratefulness to the Lord for the grand provisions made for our welfare, the food brought to us in our Monday evening study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and for the provision of taking us to the convention. We know that the time is short in which to complete the “strange work”, and our great desire is to fulfill our commission by working shoulder to shoulder and at unity one with another, fully recognizing the Theocratic arrangement which operates at Bethel as throughout all of the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">All sincere lovers of liberty and righteousness admire the courage and fortitude of the British people. They are fighting against a beastly horde of gangsters that are taking all peace from the earth. While being harassed and constantly assaulted by the wicked horde from Continental Europe, the British people show far greater consideration and kindness for Jehovah’s witnesses than any other nation now on the earth. Britain has always favored freedom, and her people have given much attention to the study of the Scriptures, and no doubt this has greatly helped them in this present hour of distress. That country officially has not attempted to curtail the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, but, on the contrary, many of the British people as never before have encouraged the spreading of this gospel message and they see that the only hope for peace and righteousness on earth is The Theocracy. The number of active field workers has greatly increased during the past year. There are now more than a thousand full-time pioneers in the field, and nearly nine thousand company publishers. Working under a great handicap of war and stress upon the people, the publication of this gospel message has largely increased throughout the nation during the year. The publishers have placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 6,200,282.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and some newspapers and a few misguided public officials in England have put forth strenuous efforts to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, but have made little or no progress. The government officials generally have been very considerate with Jehovah’s witnesses and their work, and for that kindness the Lord may be expected to show them some substantial favor. It is not for us to say what the Lord will do, but we take this occasion to express appreciation of the stand the British Government takes in behalf of freedom of speech and freedom of worship and the proclamation of the only message that shall bring peace and comfort and blessings to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has a farm on the east coast that makes the effort to supply the London Bethel family and others of the brethren in London with food. Several pioneer camps are maintained at London, and the farm has been a great aid during the period of the war to help them get their necessary food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With bombs dropping on every side and with great distress, the Lord has preserved his people and given them mueh courage, and with joy and enthusiasm they have pressed on in the Kingdom service. Daily they view increased evidences that the great climax is near at hand, and soon the Kingdom in full operation will bring the desire of all honest and sincere persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some time it has been difficult to make shipments of literature to England, because of war conditions, and it was necessary to do some printing in London; but now the shipping restrictions have been made much easier and shipments still go, although these shipments must be made as a free gift to the London branch. It is a real joy to the hearts of their American brethren to see the steadfastness and faith and devotion of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report submitted by the local representative at London gives a review of the work, and from that report we quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year’s text, '“My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation,” has been continually upon our hearts and minds during the past fiscal year. The text so appropriately expressed our joy and gratitude to Jehovah in being granted preservation for a year full of Theocratic service. Having taken refuge ’under the wings of the Most High and abiding under the ■shadow of the Almighty, we were privileged to give a marvelous testimony to The Theocracy and to share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The leadership of our King Christ Jesus was never more manifest than during this past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outlook for the “strange work” at the beginning of the year was very uncertain. Britain had just entered the war and the whole nation was in the midst of adjusting itself to wartime conditions. The people were in fear and perplexity, expectant of an immediate fierce outbreak of the conflict. As a whole, there was a grim determination to see the war through. Many expedient wartime measures were brought into force, among them an embargo on our imports of books, booklets and records. We were thus cut off from the source of our supplies, the Brooklyn factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the precarious ■situation the spirit and enthusiasm of the British brethren were high. The field organization was firm and solid, fully primed for whatever action was required by The Theocracy. Insurmountable difficulties and a blank wall seemed to loom before us, consisting of all manner of war restrictions and conditions. Many of the brethren asked the Lord in prayer, Would he now permit his recently strengthened band of vigorous warriors to be brought to a halt in this land while there yet seemed so many of the “other sheep” to be gathered into the fold? The Lord gave his answer and guided his servants accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With full confidence in the Lord, we embarked upon the new fiscal year commencing with the “Theocracy” Testimony Period, of October, 1939. The special campaign literature featuring the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font5"> booklet was not available, as it could not be imported. Therefore all the publishers worked on supplies of the older booklets. No particular opposition arose, and the month’s period finished off as one of our finest campaigns. A splendid new peak of 7,266 publishers participated. This evident blessing from the Lord clearly indicated he had much more work for us to do in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Theocracy” campaign gave all of us increased courage and confidence to launch forward a great year of Kingdom activity. The war seemed to have reached a deadlock; conditions in the country began to ease and return to a more normal order. The people began to say “this is a peculiar war, no real fighting”. The “black-out” was a nuisance, food rationing a subject of common discussion, and limitation of petrol supplies dampened freedom of travel; but adjustment to these unpleasantries was not difficult. This holding back of hostilities made it possible for the “locusts” to keep on their job bringing comfort and consolation to people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Flash from the Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Near the end of October a great flash of light came from the Temple, revealed through the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> “Neutrality.” To all of us in Britain it seemed a special answer to our prayer. The time had come for us to declare our position; to let the authorities know where we stood and what was to be our course of action. Our Commander and Leader, Christ Jesus, gave us instruction and defined our position in one sweeping stroke. His counsel at John 17:16, “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world,” was to be our firm and uncompromising stand. Jehovah and Christ Jesus are neutral as to wars of this world. Therefore we as their servants must follow the same course. Throughout the land the brethren hastened to make their individual position clear to those about them. A large number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Neutrality</span><span class="font5"> booklets were printed at the London Office and quickly distributed to all the publishers and their people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Declaration of Neutrality Stand</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only did Jehovah, through his Chief Executive Officer, reveal this precious truth of neutrality, but he also “furnished the opportunity for its nation-wide declaration. Coinciding with this Temple flash of light the British Government issued on October 30 its White Paper (Cmd. 6120) entitled “Treatment of German Nationals in Germany”, a report compiled by Sir Neville Henderson, the returned British ambassador from Berlin. Immediately the press, the radio and the public in the land, and indeed all over the world, discussed the contents of this document which fully exposed the persecution of the Jews and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ernste Bibel-forscher</span><span class="font5"> (Jehovah’s witnesses) in Germany during the past seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here while the news was fresh was the opportunity for Jehovah’s witnesses in Britain to declare their position of neutrality even as their brethren in Germany. On November 15 the Society issued the following statement to the Government and the press:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The White Paper (Germany No. 2) entitled “Treatment of German Nationals in Germany”, published October 30, makes mention several times of the “Earnest Bible Students”, the name given to the members of the International Bible Students Association, and who are known in Britain as Jehovah’s witnesses. The White Paper makes public the cruel sufferings and the wicked persecution to which these God-fearing men have been subjected, because of their refusal to acknowledge to Hitler the loyalty of conscience and service which belongs to God alone. They have consistently refused to ‘Heil Hitler’, refusing to recognize him as the representative of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following extracts are taken from H.M. Government’s White Paper:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There were 1,500 Jews and 800 Ernste Bibelforscher (International Bible Students) . . . Each man wore a badge—Jews yellow with the star of David, Bible Students violet, etc. . . . Jewish prisoners wrote and received letters twice a month. The Bible Students were allowed no communication with the outside world, but, on the other hand, tneir rations were not cut down. Herr X spoke with the highest respect of these men. Their courage and religious faith were remarkable, and they professed themselves ready to suffer to the uttermost what they felt God had ordained for them.” (Page 10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The next group were the ‘Bibelforscher’, a religious sect taking its doctrine from the Bible and having a considerable membership in every part of the country, but proscribed by the Gestapo since its members refuse military service; these unhappy people were almost as badly treated as the Jews.” (Page 35)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany have consistently maintained a position of neutrality in accordance with their Christian principles. Our Berne Office reports more than 6,000 are now confined in concentration camps and this because they refuse to put the State above their Christian worship of Almighty God. They prefer to stand for the Theocratic Government, which is the heavenly, invisible government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus, the King, who is invisible to human eyes. They are maintaining their integrity to Jehovah under test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses, wherever they reside, are loyal to the laws and customs of the countries, seeking to serve God and are of good-will to all men. If they are judged by men as disloyal it is only when a human law is enacted which interposes a human instruction contrary to the Scriptures, or would give to a man the worship which belongs only to Almighty God. That the position of Jehovah’s witnesses in relation to present events may be clear, a pamphlet republished from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is enclosed. At the same time this makes plain the reason for their neutrality in all cases, and why they are unable to take part in anything military.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On behalf of the thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses in Britain we wish to make this position clear. As servants of the Most High God, our position is identical with that of our German brethren, namely, that of strict neutrality. Our devotion, service and loyalty are consecrated to Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, and according to John 17:16, “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” We also enclose a copy of our publication </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font5"> for your perusal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This statement resulted in much publicity throughout the land and has been quoted and commented upon many times in the press during the past nine months. All members of Parliament, the Government, religious leaders, and local officials were served with a copy of this statement together with a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Neutrality</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace.</span><span class="font5"> This bold declaration laid the foundation for a marvelous year of uninterrupted Theocratic service. The authorities and the people learned that we were not pacifists and had no connection with the many pacifist movements which were causing trouble in the land. There was evident respect for our position. The only opposition came from the Catholic and Catholic-controlled press which endeavored to brand us as subversive. Informed people and rulers knew differently and gave us every consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Books Printed In London</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The manifest leading of the Lord pointed to a great work for the year 1940, and no time was lost in entering into contracts for large-scale printing in London. The import restrictions did not prevent us from having our publications printed inside the country. Within a few weeks scores of thousands of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> books were being shipped to the field publishers Likewise hundreds of thousands of the new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font5"> booklets. The British editions were printed from the same molds as the Brooklyn publications, making the books in both lands uniform. All together, our London printers completed 250,000 bound books and 1,200,000 booklets; which, by the way, was a gigantic order for this large printing house. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font5">book has had a phenomenal distribution, and is so appropriately circulated during these gloomy months of war and uncertainty. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font5"> were gladly received by the British people and brought much comfort and consolation to lovers of righteousness, the “Lazarus” company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Embargo Lifted</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Late in December, 1939, Jehovah’s hand was further with us when, after several months of conferences, the Government import licensing department finally agreed to grant us import licenses for our books, booklets and records. (Supplies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> were allowed importation right from the beginning of the war, under special permit.) What rejoicing there was late in January when boatloads of the Theocratic message again began to arrive safely in London as in the former days! All the Bethel boys were glad, and so were the brethren in the field, as all preferred the American publications, which are so well made by the Society’s own factory in Brooklyn. From January to the end of this fiscal year we imported, by the Lord’s grace, 351 tons of Theocratic instruction. This is quite a reduction in tonnage when compared with the previous year’s imports. Nevertheless we are indeed grateful for the consideration the British authorities have given us in permitting these vital imports and granting shipping space on them steamers. All our shipments arrived safely; none were lost by enemy action. We also keenly appreciate the marvelous co-operation and efforts made by our American brethren in making it possible during these difficult times to send us these supplies. Many of the supplies were sent us as gifts which have entailed a great sacrifice on the part of our American brethren. Surely Jehovah will repay them a rich reward for helping their brethren in the hour of their great need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Results in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results in the field have been most gratifying. The field report for the year is the largest on record. The distribution of bound books amounted to practically 800,000 copies for the year. This amazing total is 2J times the bound-book output for 1939. Additionally, 5,401,184 booklets were placed with the people, as well as 825,111 magazines placed by the route and street method as organized during 1940. The attractive magazine bags as designed at Brooklyn have become very popular in Britain, and more than 4,000 publishers participate in the magazine work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> has had a wonderful distribution and has been widely advertised throughout the land as the only source of Theocratic instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most interesting part of the field report is the increase in publishers. In 1939 we reported a peak of 6,861 publishers For 1940 the highest number of active workers amounted to 9,860, or an increase of 3,000; practically a 50-percent increase. For the five consecutive months beginning with March (while Hitler was overrunning Denmark and Norway) we had five consecutive peaks in publishers. In fact, with each new stage of the war a new all-time peak of publishers seemed to result. The numbers of new publishers just came pouring m. As the war tribulation increased more and more of the “great multitude” took their stand for The Theocracy. Surely the Scripture is fulfilled, at Revelation 7:14, where it says: ‘These are they that come out of the great tribulation.’ These are the doings of the Lord, and our report confirms the evidence that he is now gathering the “other sheep” into the Theocratic fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the increase in workers there was a corresponding 50-pereent increase in the number of field hours as compared with the 1939 report. The immense number of 2,462,081 hours were spent m the field. This is record of the great determination on the part of the British brethren to push forward the Kingdom work at all costs and regardless of conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new subscriptions for the magazines amounted to 9,284. The total magazine distribution for the year, including copies to subscribers, amounted to 825,016 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and 573,350 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the sound work’s being banned for two months, the sound attendance for the year amounted to 1,340,085 persons having heard the Theocratic message. 5,147 phonographs are used in the field work, and especially in the doorstep work. 287 transcription machines and 139 sound-ears perform their share of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With many sections of the country now in the war zone, the back-call work has become the sole means of carrying forward the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom work and feeding the people of goodwill through the model study arrangement. We are pleased to report a grand total of 363,322 back-calls for the year, which is more than double last year’s back-call service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This tremendous field campaign has required much organization and organization supervision through the zone servants Eighty-five new companies have been organized and added to the list, bringing the total number of organized units to 449. Almost every company m the land now maintains its own Kingdom Hall. Each week throughout Britain 1,470 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and Bible studies operate to serve the brethren and the people of good-will. AH appointments of study conductors are made through the London office. At present the country is divided into 29 zones and into 4 regions. One of the zones (which would have made the 30th) was discontinued during the year because of the Nazi invasion of the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands, with their more than 40 scattered faithful publishers, carried on their work right up to the invasion in July. These brethren are now cut oft from the London Office, but doubtless are standing firm for The Theocracy under test. During the year 1,673 brethren symbolized their consecration by water immersion. At the Memorial the number in attendance was 8,755, and the number of partakers was 3,636.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Comparison Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Enclosed find a comparison report of the field work for the past five years. In 1937 the total distribution of books and booklets amounted to 2,399,296. For 1940 the figure has risen to 6,200,282. All the other items have doubled or trebled. Surely Jehovah has permitted a mighty witness to be given to the British people before the “strange work” is completed for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This branch of the service has prospered greatly during 1940. At the end of last year we reported 511 pioneers active in the service. For 1940 this figure doubled to the grand total of 1,037 full-time warriors of The Theocracy. The actual enrollment for September amounts to 1,115, and it is still on the increase. In December, 1937, when only 186 pioneers were in service, a thousand pioneers were asked for to satisfactorily serve the British field. By some this was thought a wild dream, but now it is more than fulfilled and the need for hundreds more still exists. The field is immense and the laborers are increasing. The thousand pioneers during 1940 placed 418,924 bound books and 2,190,975 booklets. More than one million hours of field service were put in, and 147,516 back-calls made. Their sound attendance amounted to 434,168. There are twenty-two pioneer homes in operation, in various large centers of the country, wherein 210 pioneers are accommodated for service. May it please Jehovah to continue to richly bless this pioneer army as it seeks to serve him faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocracy Extension Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the fiscal year the entire field was equipped with the splendid new recordings of “Government and Peace” and “Victory”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklet No. 2 was also released. These timely instruments proved to be very effective in teaching people of good-will the message of The Theocracy and an aid in building up such good-will interest. With Brother Rutherford’s approval a nation-wide campaign of public model studies was organized. This Theocracy extension work was carried on by most of the companies in their outlying territories. Additionally, under the local supervision of the zone servants, the Society financed the holding of public model studies in prominent halls in isolated territories outside the confines of established companies. The extension service consisted of a series of four weekly meetings held at a good public hall. The people were invited to attend by the regular distribution of handbills and personal letters addressed to those known as interested. The British public enjoyed getting questions answered directly from the Bible. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklet No. 2 was used as the basis for these questions and answers. Our records show that 4,176 such public meetings were held during the year, with a combined attendance of 157,663, of which 31,111 were strangers. This extension work resulted in the building up of almost 40 new service units and contributed greatly toward our 3,000 new publishers for the year. This public meeting campaign was hard work, and there were many disappointments. But, on the whole, good results obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Evi! Servant”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Members of the “evil servant” continued to manifest themselves throughout the year in various sections of the country. The faithful brethren avoided such enemies of The Theocracy. Such opposers have gone oft into complete darkness. The Lord filled their places with live, alert Jonadabs who are eager to perform the Lord’s will. The “evil servant” have endeavored to do all manner of harm. They have made false accusations to the authorities against the faithful brethren. They have consorted with agents of the Hierarchy to brand Jehovah’s witnesses as subversive. The Lord will bring full retribution upon these “goats” in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Roman Catholic Attacks</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy continues to lead in religious persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses. Their press has been full of slanderous subtle attacks endeavoring to brand us as subversive, calling us “fifth columnists”. Their numerous press articles are of the usual Catholic type. As in America, they have endeavored to make us the scapegoat while they proceed to pull off their dirty work. The agents of the Hierarchy in this land are the real “fifth columnists”, and the authorities have an eye on them, after what has so obviously happened in France and Belgium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Trimming a Vicar</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Church of England vicar, Ernest D. Panter, of Brims-eombe, was responsible for publishing in his church magazine the following statement: “Jehovah’s witnesses were busily engaged in undermining the authority of the State.” This hbelous statement was the subject of legal action on the part of the Society’s solicitors, and this vicar was forced to publish a retraction and to pay ten guineas costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Riots and Assaults</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religionists were responsible for 71 cases of assault against Jehovah’s people in Britain during 1940. Twelve mob riots were organized by Catholic leaders. Several court cases resulted from these assaults, and the brethren received satisfaction. Early in the year a special campaign was organized in the Clydebank district where so many previous riots have occurred. The large number of publishers participating in this campaign were each armed with either a cane or an umbrella. The Clydebank police gave reluctant assistance while this campaign was in progress. No violence occurred. The Catholic hoodlums saw that Jehovah’s witnesses meant business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year 1940 witnessed the greatest press publicity ever given Jehovah’s witnesses in this land. There must have been more than a thousand press write-ups, appearing in almost every newspaper in the country. Many pictures were also published. Some of these articles were fair comment, while others, especially in the Catholic-controlled press, have bordered on Ebel and slander. The Society’s solicitors are now busy on a Ebel action against one of the largest national Sunday papers. The press reports covered a wide field of activity. They commented on the stand made by the brethren before the tribunals, the Government’s White Paper, our various phases of field work, our pubEc meetings, reports of our conventions, and comments on the order in council issued against the brethren in Canada. By and large, this press campaign of the demons has further brought the name “Jehovah’s witnesses” before the pubEc. The radio has also occasionally reported items mentioning Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To combat these press attacks Brother Rutherford gave us permission to print issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> exposing these agents of the demons. On January 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font5">No. 5, entitled “Can Religion Save the World from Disaster?” was released, and during January more than a million copies were distributed to the public. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font5">No. 6, entitled “Which Will Give You Freedom? Religion or Christianity?” was dated February 15. A milEon of these were also distributed early in spring, which fully answered the Catholic Press attacks. On August 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> No. 7 was released, and it bore the title “Religionists Devise Mischief to Destroy Christians”. This issue fully answered the press implying that we were a subversive organization and “fifth columnists”. More than a million of these also were put in the hands of the people. Our enemies have been answered every time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every effort was made for the overseas transmission to London of the Detroit Theocratic convention of July 24-28. War conditions at the time made it impossible to engage these transmission services. Hence special arrangements were made throughout Britain for all the brethren and people of good-will to meet together on Sunday, July 28, at 4 p.m. Fourteen thousand assembled at the various Kingdom halls. At this united assembly the wonderful new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion </span><span class="font5">was revealed as a surprise to all the brethren. Thus the British brethren joined in the thrill of receiving this surprise even as the American brethren at Detroit. The brethren were further surprised to learn that, in addition to all of them receiving their copy of the autographed edition, there were large supplies available at each Kingdom hall of the public edition and which could be begun to be distributed during the “Religion’s Doom” period of August. Both the Brooklyn and the London office worked hard to make it possible to get 150,000 of these new books shipped to this country and then secretly to all the companies in time for this big event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Rutherford arranged for the holding of three extension conventions in Britain: Manchester, August 30 to September 1; Edmburgh, September 13-15; London, September 29. In the Lord’s providence these three conventions were successfully held during the heat of war. It was indeed a miracle and a marvelous blessing from the Lord. The records of Brother Rutherford’s masterful Detroit speech “Religion as a World Remedy” were rushed by transatlantic air mail to London. After passing through the hands of the censors they finally arrived m time for the great Manchester convention Brother Rutherford’s Saturday speech, “The End,” was also read to the brethren from the manuscript which had been sent by air mail. All the brethren were greatly thrilled by these two wonderful messages from the Theocrat. At Manchester 4,000 attended; Edmburgh, 1,500; and London, 2,500; making a total of 8,000. These conventions were the most joyous held in this land, and brought much comfort, strength and courage to the British brethren. Those who attended risked everything to get to these conventions. Air raids, hombs, gun-fire and transportation difficulties did not prevent the faithful from being present. Never have we seen such a large group of brethren so full of fife, smiling, possessing great peace of mind and determination to serve The Theocracy. At Manchester alone one thousand pioneers were in attendance, and did they make that city hum with Kingdom activity!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The twenty-four members of the London Bethel family have had another full year of Theocratic service. The health of the family has been excellent. Every one has been able to keep up with the heavy demands for time, often working all day and then late in the evenings. Their field report is as follows: 24 publishers, 1,880 bound books, 13,863 booklets, 4,796 hours, 24 subscriptions, 1,865 magazines, 6,858 sound attendance, and 365 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sound department reports manufacture of 683 phonographs and completion of 37 electrical transcription machines for sound-cars. A large number of repairs were also effected. This department also undertook the making of 4,000 magazine bags according to the Brooklyn pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The printing department had a most busy year. This department turned out 9,830,705 pieces of printed matter, consisting of booklets, calendars, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font5"> office forms, folders, etc. According to instructions from the president’s office, a transfer was effected from the Berne Office of a typesetting machine which we badly needed. This arrived in excellent order and was set up for out use immediately. This typesetting machine has been a great boon to our printing work, and we greatly appreciate the provision made for our use of it. It was quite a feat during the wartime to transport such a large machine from Switzerland, through France, and then across the Channel, without a mishap. Also about this time we succeeded in importing from Switzerland 500 phonograph motors and parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shipping department had a busy time. They received 351 tons of literature and records from Brooklyn during the year. Additionally they handled the large printing consignments from our London printers. For the year they dispatched 80,524 parcels into the field, consisting of a total of 863,615 bound books and 5,905,216 booklets and 800,000 magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The office staff of ten have dealt with a variety of new problems. Such matters as applications for licenses, rendering of government reports on movements of supplies, food control, petrol distribution for the thirty vehicles operated by the Society, evacuation of brethren from war centers, legal advice on the House to House Collections Act and other situations, caring for refugees from Belgium, internment problems, police inquiries, rehabilitation of some of the brethren who fled from the Channel Islands, and negotiating all manner of complaints. These problems were handled m addition to” the normal office routine and organization problems. Our hands have been full. 52,770 letters were received during the year, and 67,805 letters dispatched. With everyone pulling his weight and giving splendid co-operation, the British branch has been able to cope with the many details necessary for an organization which has grown fifty percent in size, and piloting it through the many rough seas of the present war emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">London Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The London company has had a wonderful growth during the past twelve months. There are now twenty-one service units organized in the greater city, with a corresponding number of Kingdom halls. The peak number of company publishers is 1,700, with an additional complement of 150 pioneers Five pioneer homes have been operated throughout the year, housing 50 pioneers. In spite of the great difficulties in London during August and September, we are pleased to report that the total output of books anti booklets in the greater city has again exceeded the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">milli</span><span class="font5">on mark, the exact figure being 1,024,593. Londoners cannot complain of not having an opportunity to hear about The Theocracy. Many sections of London were being covered every three or four weeks. At the last united assembly for the London company 2,200 London brethren and Jonadabs were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Strange Work” on the War Front</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After two months on the war front with air raids and bombardments continuously every night and most of the days, the London office and brethren are still very much alive and on the job with the “strange work”. Yes, these are horrible times and there is destruction visible in most of the territories. London and southeastern England are the battlefield, with the dreadful experiences of war becoming part of everyday life. Some of the brethren have had their homes and possessions destroyed, but the next day you see these courageous brethren in the field comforting the people with the Theocratic message. Three of the London pioneer homes were bombed out late in September. Not one of the 34 pioneer sisters in these homes at the time of the bombardment was injured or scratched. Of course, they were shaken, but their nerves were restored quickly, and back on the pioneer work they went more determined than ever to fight the demons now seeking to destroy men of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the companies in southeastern England have had to evacuate </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">en masse.</span><span class="font5"> Such have been rehabilitated in safer sections of the country and are carrying on their Kingdom service. Kingdom School, with twenty children, was moved from Kent to a quiet place in Devon, and the whole lot go out in the service in their new territory on week-ends. So far in the war sections four pioneer homes and nine Kingdom halls have been put out of action and damaged. Only two of the publishers have been killed by the Nazi demons’ air war. It is marvelous to see the calmness and determination of the brethren in spite of this frightful rain of death and destruction which rages continually over our heads. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> studies and service meetings are well attended and held on schedule, air raids or no air raids. The organized field work continues each week, and the people in the desolated areas are glad to receive the comfort from the Lord’s servants. The brethren don’t wish to run away from the fight, but are determined to remain as long as it is possible to see their Kingdom job finished. There have been some miraculous deliverances, and the brethren have come through with their lives even though they may have lost everything else. This whole grim affair at times seems a nightmare, but as soon as the banshee sounds and the guns go off shaking the very ground one stands on and one hears the bombs whistling through the air, one quickly awakes again to reality. These conditions make the brethren yearn more than ever for peace and righteousness. It is fully realized that such is possible only through the early full establishment of The Theocratic Government, in which we place our every hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British brethren fully appreciate the strong meat which comes to us so regularly through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font5">We indeed thank our heavenly Father for this life-sustaining food, which is the only thing that keeps ns going and makes us determined to be found faithful to the end. From the marvelous </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font5"> on “Times and Seasons” we know it won’t be long now to witness our full deliverance and, above all, to see the complete vindication of Jehovah’s matchless name. We are standing alert for “the sign” of “Peace and safety!” We also appreciate </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> and its bold fight against the agents of the Hierarchy, and receive much help from your contributions therein as “Counsel”. The “Counsel” entitled “Invisible Warrior Protectors” was timely and practical advice for those of us in this field. It is a comforting reahzation that Jehovah has given his angels as guardians and protectors over His earthly servants at this time seeking to advance the interests of The Theocracy. Brother Rutherford, the brethren also appreciate your great concern for the welfare of the British field and your many messages of greetings and love. Your words of comfort lighten our load, and we joyously go on our way to finish our share of the “strange work” while it is yet day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Supplies of the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font5"> have now arrived, and quantities of the new recordings are on their way across the Atlantic. This indicates there is still some work that must be done in the few months just ahead of us. We thank the Most High for the privileges of service this past year and wish to assure that we will carry on the work until the cities be wasted away, and until our commander Christ Jesus says, “It is finished.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Remarks: In the Lord’s providence this has been the greatest year ever of activity in proclaiming The Theocracy to the people of this land. This work has been accomplished during a whole year of warfare on the part of this country. The output of bound books has been marvelous. The growth in number of pioneers and company publishers has been wonderful. We give all praise and honor to Jehovah for being privileged to render such a splendid report for this field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is our blessed privilege to acknowledge the Lord’s protection to his printed message being delivered to London during the year. Because of the war shipping facilities have been hard to obtain. A license had to be obtained from the British Government to have books go on the ships. Such license was from time to time obtained, and during the fiscal year the Brooklyn office shipped 351 tons of literature from Brooklyn to London. Every one of these ships except one landed our literature safely in England without any damage. One ship was torpedoed, but not destroyed, and the only damage done to the literature of the Lord’s people was four cartons that got wet, and yet they were landed safely. No one who loves the Lord has any doubt about the protection that was given in that. Therefore this literature went over according to his will, and he who controls the sea and the land and all the power in the universe saw to it that his message got safely across. Doubtless he permitted the four eartons to get wet to demonstrate that the enemy can do only a little damage if he exercises his power against the enemy. Many thrilling experiences showing the hand of the Lord in protecting his people from air raids have been received from London. Some of these reports are inserted below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We could tell you some real stirring experiences of the courage and faith of the London brethren. Brethren whose homes have been destroyed on the Friday are out in the field work the next Sunday as if nothing had happened. The brethren are putting forth every effort they have to take the Theocratic message to the people of good-will. During one model study a sister was holding, the entire house was destroyed and crumbled, burying the sister and her three listeners in a pile of debris. The A.R.P. wardens dug them out, and these four lovers of righteousness were unharmed and delivered. Some day we shall be able to give you the full story, but may this suffice to give you an indication of what the brethren are going through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneer home No. 4, in East London, houses eight pioneers (women). They were all sound asleep when, at 4 a.m. Wednesday, September 18, a bomb demolished the house second door from the pioneer home. The pioneers were buried under a blanket of plaster and glass and loose furniture. Not one of them was injured or scratched. With assistance of Air Raid Precaution wardens they were safely extracted from the ruins and took refuge at the home of a man of good-will and his wife around the corner. This Jonadab and his wife just came into the truth three weeks before. They rendered every assistance, having fed and housed these eight pioneers in their small home for three days. The Jonadab stayed home from his secular work to assist in the care of them and also to rescue their belongings from the debris. Surely the Lord will remember him and his family for this great act of kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">London Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What can truly be said to be the most amazing convention ever held by Jehovah’s witnesses was the one-day 1940 convention held in London on Sunday, September 29, at the Golders Green Hippodrome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For months the London brethren had eagerly looked forward to their own convention with the zeal which is so customary with the Londoners and home county people. As Hitler’s aerial Blitzkrieg increased in violence, the possibility of holding the convention in England became increasingly difficult. Air raid upon air raid, with the destruction, evacuation and disruption of public services and transport, made the mere thought of assembling a large number of people together for hours at a stretch seem most unwise and very dangerous. Hall after hall was tried, but was refused for a variety of reasons. Nearly all large buildings such as would hold a great concourse of people had already been taken over by the military authorities, and the others closed for the duration of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The date for the Manchester convention drew nearer, and it was thought best to forget London and make quite sure of Manchester. Brethren all over Britain were hastily advised to come to Manchester at all costs, as it had been found necessary to abandon the plans for London. As stated elsewhere, the brethren responded marvelously and made their way to Manchester despite many difficulties. Manchester over, Edinburgh was quickly arranged and held without a hitch and attended by a great number of brethren from all parts of Scotland and the North of England. Still the Cockneys were disappointed, but did not grumble, but calmly waited the Lord’s pleasure. The aerial bombardment continued with added intensity and fury, growing steadily worse each day. Reports flowed into the London Bethel every day by telephone and letter telling of brethren being bombed out of their homes. With the coming of darkness each night came the bombers, which were instantly met with a terrific anti-aircraft barrage, which deadly duel from sky and earth made the coming of darkness an automatic curfew keeping all prudent ones indoors. In these appalling conditions came the sudden news that a London convention had been arranged for London brethren and all near-by companies, that all the high spots of Manchester and Edinburgh were to be put on at Golders Green Hippodrome with Brother Rutherford’s two great speeches from Detroit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The letter mail has long since become unreliable, due to unavoidable delay caused by dislocation by air raids; therefore a courier service was immediately introduced whereby all units were informed by letter of the details of the convention. Excitement ran high and immediately all near-by companies were feverishly preparing to attend by every available means of transport. The hiring of the Hippodrome was clearly the Lord’s work, as it had already been refused before, there having been several delayed-action bombs dropped in the immediate vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only seven days’ notice was possible, but the news ran round the city and home counties like wildfire. Many brethren have had to vacate their homes and are living temporarily in other homes, but all were told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The eve of the convention was the signal for the demons through Hitler to launch an extra devilish attack on London, and after an eight-hour ceaseless night raid with an “all clear” at 5 a.m. brethren had their breakfast with a daylight raid in progress at 8 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, it was convention day in London for the Lord’s people, and so with light hearts full of joy of the Lord 2,500 determined “locusts” from south and southeastern England set out for the Hippodrome in London and every one arrived safely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At 10:30 Sunday morning the program commenced with a meeting for all servants of the many companies represented, while the other publishers engaged in the field service. Here at this servants’ meeting it was learned that organized book studies in the evenings would be discontinued until further notice, owing to the danger of being out after dark under the shrapnel barrage which descends on London with the darkness. The great importance of back-calls and model studies was stressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Kingdom Hall, Craven Terrace, where this servants’ meeting was held, to the Hippodrome came the eager, smiling faces gathering to feed at the Lord’s table under conditions as strange and as exciting as never before. Jehovah’s rich blessing was abundantly evident from the very commencement. There was a feeling of electric expectancy about the whole assembly. Brethren told tales of transport dislocation as they arrived. Wise “locusts” had been up before times, realizing and anticipating difficulties. Journeys normally taking thirty minutes by underground railway were occupying three hours, with seven or eight changes of vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention times had been wisely arranged as between the hours of 1 p m. and 5 p.m. to enable all brethren to be well on their way home before the expected evening aerial visitation by demon-controlled agents of Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sharp at 1 p.m. the convention opened with songs and declarations, and followed immedately with a report of the happenings at Detroit, the key city for the Theocratic Convention. Then followed the reading of Brother Rutherford’s wonderful speech, “The End.” This speech was a high spot, as this was denied the Manchester convention, the text not arriving in time. Reports as to the significance of the speech had sped from Edinburgh convention, and the London brethren were all attuned for the great moment. Every word was eagerly listened to, and as the outworkings of our heavenly Father’s great purpose towards His people in these last days were unfolded, the great pleasure was manifest on all faces. The eagerness with which the news of the great “sign” “Peace and safety!” was received was a great joy to witness. The actual recordings of the speech will be a great feast for all Jehovah’s people and his “other sheep”. The audience was unanimous in their shout of “Aye” approving of the declaration titled “Message of Hope”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following a fifteen-minute break Brother Hemery gave a discourse on the 46th and 2nd Psalms and their relation to present-day events. Never were his words so eagerly listened to. Through Brother Hemery the Lord showed us that Hitler and his demons would like to have prevented this great gathering at this time. Also that Jehovah would preserve His remnant and the faithful Jonadabs to witness the great manifestation of His power through the “strange act”, which was nearer than many of us had thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Schroeder then gave us a thrilling discourse dealing with the service side of the work. It was his privilege to inform the brethren of the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font5"> and to tell us of the new recordings which were then at that moment on their way over from Brooklyn and that we were to have thousands of new discs for the door-to-door work. What a thrill that was, to know that the Lord had further work for his people and more food for the “great multitude”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the realization of the absolute importance of the back-call and model-study work in these last hours it is another marvelous provision of the Lord to provide these new weapons. The unfailing certainty with which these books, booklets and records cross the Atlantic all through the war is a source of never-failing wonder and thanksgiving to all the British brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the culminating event of the whole day, the voice of Brother Rutherford giving his masterful lecture “Religion as a World Remedy”. What a marvelous indictment of religion, uncompromisingly sounding forth its early destruction ! Repeatedly the British brethren joined the American audience in their numerous and loud applauses. This part of the convention was so real that it took us right back to Detroit and made us feel as part of that vast assembly. Brother Rutherford indeed champions the cause of The Theocracy as does no other man m the earth today. May God bless him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Rutherford’s personal remarks to the brethren at the close of the public lecture were so encouraging, and sent us all home with blood tingling and an earnest desire to give our all in serving the Lord while there is yet time. We “love a fight”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During Brother Rutherford’s lecture there was an air raid in progress, and the booming of the guns could be heard in the background. This rather added more to the forcefulness of the lecture than causing a disturbance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the conclusion of the convention the whole assembly enthusiastically supported in sending the following cable to Brother Rutherford: “In Lord’s providence thr</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">illin</span><span class="font5">g London convention held today. 2,500 children of light assembled. All send you and American brethren love and greetings. Your speeches have filled us with joy and zeal to continue the fight for The Theocracy despite conditions. Standing alert for the sign of Armageddon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To this Brother Rutherford promptly cabled a reply as follows: “Message from London children of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">g thrilling your American brethren. May He give you complete victory and endless joy. Rutherford.” The brethren will indeed appreciate these warm greetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “all clear” (from the air raid) sounded just at the close of the convention, thus enabling all the brethren to make a safe journey homeward. To Jehovah’s people the “all clear” sounded in 1922, and the fight is still on, but the end of that grand fight will be soon, when they say, ‘Teace and safety!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus ended a real day of Theocratic triumph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nightly terror commenced true to form at 8 p.m., by which time we hope all the brethren were safely home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Belfast Theocratic conventioners send loving greetings. Jehovah directed safe arrival of records Most thrilling lecture ever heard. Wonderful reproduction.

<p><span class="font5">The Society’s office at Cape Town, South Africa, directs the witness work for all South Africa, including the Rhodesias, Nyasaland, Portuguese East Africa, and St. Helena. Being a part of the British Commonwealth of nations, necessarily the people of South Africa are involved in the war and war conditions affect everything; but in the face of all of this, the witness work has gone forward. As in other parts of the earth, it is dividing the people, which is as the Lord foretold. The “goats” are manifesting themselves so clearly that there can be no doubt about it, and the people of good-will are hastening to put themselves under the protection of the great Theocratic Government, looking to the day of complete deliverance when their blessings shall be complete and without end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report of the Society’s office situate at Cape Town the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is with gratitude to the great Theoerat, Jehovah, and to his King, Christ Jesus, that this report is rendered. World conditions have not interfered thus far with the work of The Theocracy in this part of the earth. On the other hand, they have given a fillip to it. Opposition, with the Hierarchy in the van, difficulties and obstacles there have been in plenty, but the Lord has kept the door open and, as the figures bear out, it has been by far our best year to date. The field service report reflects an increase in every part of the work. “The pile of stones” has now reached such proportions that, come what may, nothing will ever be able to move it! We give praise to Jehovah for the increase He has given. The total distribution of literature from the office during the year amounted to 112,615 bound volumes, 460,561 booklets, and 97,228 magazine copies. The books were in 25 different languages, and the magazines in five. We sent out 112 phonographs and 3,510 twelve-inch records. The latter all carried various aspects of the Kingdom message. The peak of publishers went up from 4,025 to 5,506. A summary of all work reported to the South African office is first given, and that is followed by a detailed report for each country under the jurisdiction of this branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Union of South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Based on our figures for the preceding year and allowing for an increase of 25 percent, we set a quota of 700 publishers and 150,000 hours. By April we had passed our new quota of publishers, and by the end of the service year we had reached a new peak of 881 publishers; while the hours of field service totaled 195,794, to compare with 121,237 last year. There has, therefore, been an increase of 60 percent in number of publishers and 62 percent in the time spent in the field. Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 20 addressed to all publishers of The Theocracy was both an encouragement and an incentive to increased zeal. Back-calls have been practically doubled (27,923, to compare with 15,438), and every faithful publisher has endeavored to give more time and work to advertising The Theocratic Government. The new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> and the special bound-book campaign in January enabled us to greatly increase bound-book placements, which totaled 80,468 this year, to compare with 65,398 in the previous year. The booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font5"> have both had a wide distribution, and, in all, 325,496 booklets were placed during the year. The sound attendance has gone up from 216,264 to 274,524. Sound-cars and transcription machines number 25, and there have been upward of 300 phonographs in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneer Work: During the past year there has been a monthly average of 49. These brethren, some of whom have now been in the work for many years, have again given a good lead. They spent half as much time as the total worked by the company publishers and placed 60 percent of the bound volumes distributed in the Union and obtained about 50 percent of the new subscriptions. The privilege of fulltime service has been brought forcefully to our attention in the various letters regarding the pioneer work. The number of pioneers has increased during the year from 35 to 60, and with 10 brethren serving at the branch office there are now 70 full-time representatives of The Theocracy in the Union, or 10 percent of the average number of publishers. But there is still plenty of room in the field for more, particularly of those w</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">illin</span><span class="font5">g and competent to act as company servants and zone servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Magazine Work: The new work with the magazines as outlined in the January </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> has, of course, been one of the outstanding features of the service year. As soon as that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> came to hand we realized that the time had come to publish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in Afrikaans. With your kind permission we installed a linotype machine and are now in the happy position of being able to offer both </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> to the people of this country in the two official European languages. When the decision was taken to launch </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in Afrikaans and commence publication on June 1, it was not known that Hitler would invade The Netherlands. The May issue of the Netherlands </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> (and which proved to be the last one in that language for the time being) arrived in this country at the end of May. It contained the article which was published in the issue of the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> immediately preceding the first issue translated for the Afrikaans </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Thus brethren in this country who formerly relied upon the Netherlands </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> continued to receive “food convenient” without a break; clearly a provision of the Lord for them. Prior to the commencement of the magazine work we were receiving 200 copies of each issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> in English for distribution in this country. As the distributor orders began to roll in we had to amend our order on four occasions, and for several months now we have been receiving 2,500 copies of each issue. In addition, we are sending out upward of 7,000 copies each month of the journals in Afrikaans, giving a monthly distribution of 17,000 magazines. The arrival of the magazine bags was hailed with great joy, and we now have many enthusiastic magazine publishers. Every aspect of the work is having attention, but we feel much more could be done in building up magazine routes. What can be done is indicated by one company publisher who has now 95 different persons on his route. He conducts five model studies and an open-air transcription meeting each week, all of which service is rendered after his secular duties for the day are ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Campaigns : Our favorite battle songs in this part of the earth are: “Heaven’s army is advancing,” and, “Though yesterday’s campaign is o’er, behold a new begun!” Each new campaign as it comes along is a fresh cause for thanksgiving, and although we are a long way from headquarters the excellent organization of the work at Brooklyn and timely advance notice enable us to keep in step with our brethren in America and elsewhere. Each campaign has brought its own particular blessing. Special mention, however, may be made of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign, during which we obtained 2,700 new subscriptions out of a total of 3,985 for the year. The total for the campaign was an increase of 500 over the number obtained duiing the corresponding campaign of a year ago, and the total increase in new subscriptions m the year amounted to 792.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">South African Convention: Publishers trekked from every corner of the Union to attend the convention at Johannesburg during the week-end of March 22-25. They came from points as far distant as Louis Tnehardt in the north and Cape Town and East London in the south. Every province and zone was represented. In addition, brethren came from Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland In all, 313 publishers were in action, which represented exactly half the total number of publishers in the Union at the time and a fifty-percent increase on our previous peak attendance at a convention in this country. We spent 2,555 hours in field service, placed 900 bound volumes, 3,750 booklets, 300 single magazine copies (only limited supplies were available at the convention), and obtamed 55 new subscriptions. Eight sound-cars and 100 phonographs were in use, the total sound attendance numbering 4,869. The Memorial attendance on Saturday evening was 322, and 73 partook of the emblems. It will be noted that practically 100 percent of those who attended the convention and Memorial were in action, and the majority were Jonadabs. Sixty-two brethren were </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font5">ersed and 10 new pioneers were enrolled. Instruction meetings were held for zone servants, pioneers and servants of companies, and every aspect of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom activity was covered at the Kingdom publishers meeting. The Lord’s people no longer assemble to listen to long-winded and tiresome speeches, but to receive instruction and better equip themselves for the service of The Theocracy. Such talks as were given were limited to 30 minutes and dealt with up-to-date Kingdom truths as set forth in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> The convention was preceded by an excellent advertising campaign, proving the efficiency of the Theocratic machine which the Lord has provided for the vindication of his name. Leaflets distributed numbered 75,000, while 1,000 window cards and 300 posters (40 inches by 25 inches) were placed in good positions in the city and along the Reef. Numerous ears carried banners, and special invitations were sent out to all on the local back-call file. In all, 1,000 turned out to the two public meetings, and very orderly audiences were thrilled by the great messages entitled “Government and Peace” and “Warning”. A considerable number of model studies were arranged as a result of the 240 new back-call slips turned in at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unity of purpose and action were evident on every side. Many of those who attended made a considerable effort to get there, but all who came with the one desire to honor Jehovah’s name were greatly refreshed and stimulated and went away with renewed courage and confidence to serve The Theocratic Government with diligence and fidelity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zone Activity: The Union is now divided into 8 zones. Regular attention to the various companies and to new interest on the pait of the zone servants, coupled with increased back-call and model-study activity on the part of zealous publishers, has resulted in many newly interested ones entering the field as publishers. Zone assemblies have been arranged in practically all the zones, in the bigger ones on more than one occasion, during the year. Instruction m line with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> is given and an effort made to encourage all, including the inactive ones, to appreciate the need for earnest activity at this time. The opportunity is also seized at these assemblies to put over a well-advertised public meeting and the latest recording is used. The general opinion is that the lectures given at the New York convention are the best recordings we have yet had, and they have been in greater demand and better use has been made of them than of any previous recorded lectures received to date. It is a pleasure to report that the monthly average of company publishers has increased from 407 to 607. The average hours and back-calls made by company publishers reflect increased activity on their part. Some zealous ones now reach the quota of 60 hours per month regularly and make from 30 to 40 back-calls per month. Others, although not physically able to do so much, are putting forth their best endeavors, and all who serve faithfully find that the joy of the Lord is their strength. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklet No. 2 has proved to be invaluable to all Kingdom publishers who appreciate the responsibility of aiding the people of goodwill. Our peak of publishers has gone up from 555 to 881 during the year, and this is to a great extent due to regular back-call and model-study effort. We hope that every Kingdom publisher in this land will soon accept and joyfully strive to attain the quota of three back-calls and one model study per week. Company organizations have increased from 115 to 127.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Kingdom News” No. 5: We printed 80,000 in English and 40,000 in Afrikaans. These found their way into every corner of the country and, with the other publications, have</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">helped the honest-hearted to distinguish between religion and Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The average number of publishers has increased from 473 to 593, and the new peak was 771, to compare with 573 a year ago. These brethren spent 271,484 hours in field service and placed 10,195 bound volumes and 41,092 booklets, representing an increase of 2,000 volumes and 15,000 booklets. There has been greater use made of the phonographs, with a 50-pereent increase in attendance, the total number who heard the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom message in recorded form being 60,697. Back-calls numbered 13,017, or nearly three times as many as last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The number of European publishers has increased considerably during the past twelve months, and their zealous activity has aroused the ire of the religionists no end. At one center letters containing false and malicious statements have been written to and published by the press, which at the same time has refused to publish replies sent by the Society and the local publishers. Thereby the press ranges itself alongside the conspirators who are fighting against The Theocratic Government. They apparently thought they could get away with this dirty piece of work, but the letters which they refused to publish as “undesirable” were printed by the Lord’s organization and 26 “locusts” saw to it that a copy of the leaflet was placed in every home m Bulawayo and district in one day.' Now the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> in its rage openly incites the Government in a leading article to take action against us to prevent the publishing of the message of God’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom from house to house and at the same time denies the charge of “religious intolerance”!! Their biased attitude has been deplored by the honest-hearted people of good-will, some of whom have had the courage to write and tell them so. Pressure has been brought to bear upon both European and African witnesses to make them sever their connection with the Society, but such un-Chnstian, un-British and undemocratic methods have ended in failure, and those concerned have been made to realize that the Christian will not compromise when it comes to his allegiance to and worship of Jehovah God. At Shabani Mine 20 of Jehovah’s witnesses, some of whom had served the mining company faithfully for over 10 years and the majority of whom have wives and families, were dismissed simply because they refused to remain silent but insisted on their right to publish the good news of the Kingdom in their own time. At Umtali, when the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses met to study the Bible on a Sunday afternoon at their usual meeting place outside the location (granted to them by the authorities), the Location superintendent appeared with a sjambok and a crowd of natives and began thrashing the brethren, shouting, “I am Jehovah of this place; you cannot hold your meetings near my Location.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the majority of the Senior Native Commissioners throughout the Colony share the Society’s view that our request for European representation within the Colony is a reasonable one and that such a step is desirable, the Government has once more refused us permission to open a depot. The work, however, continues to go forward, as the figures indicate, and the representatives of The Theocracy, both European and African, are m good spirit. There are 34 company organizations, and an African zone servant has again done much good work in assisting the African publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the past year the work has progressed in Northern Rhodesia as in other parts of Southern Africa. The average number of publishers went up to 1,697 from 1,198, and a new peak of 2,378 was reached. These brethren gave 648,690 hours to field service. Bound volumes distributed totaled 2,404, and booklets 30,395. Back-calls were made to the number of 7,935, to compare with 3,730 last year, and the number who listened to the Kingdom message in recorded form was 110,970. There are now 88 company organizations. The country is divided into 10 zones, and zone servants give regular attention to each company in their respective zones. The depot servant reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A brief review of the past year reveals no outstanding change in general conditions, although, of course, the war has made itself felt. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, are not amazed nor dismayed; quite to the contrary, all remain calm because we know and expect the present difficulties. Several new companies have been formed, and the newly interested friends as well as those long associated with the Society are sharing with zeal in the war against entrenched wickedness and hypocrisy. The pioneer workers and zone servants have suffered many privations and done much good work; and the depot has served, in addition to the work of general supervision, as a center to which many company servants, other servants and publishers have come for personal instruction. It is interesting to report that during the period under consideration a riot broke out on the Copper Belt and at one center several Africans were killed. At the investigation held by a Royal Commission there was no evidence whatsoever to connect Jehovah’s witnesses with the trouble, and yet, although the ringleaders were all Roman Catholics, no mention was made of this fact by the Government. On the contrary, there is reliable evidence on record that some, at least, tried very hard to obtam proof of even one of Jehovah’s witnesses as being associated with the disturbance, but these prejudiced men were unable to succeed. This has, to some extent, brought proof to many people of the power of the truth in these days, when there are many wrong things which should be put right. It is becoming clearer to them that our hope is m the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">gdom </span><span class="font5">as the way to justice and lasting righteousness. The Roman Catholic Church has felt the effect of the truth more than any other religious organization, because of its strenuous efforts to gam control of the Africans, and there is now a real manifestation of Catholic Action in the way its interests are protected and cared for by those in responsible Government positions. As conditions will doubtless become more acute, those who frame mischief by law will manifest even more fully that today it is not a case of Catholic Nazi-Fascism against democracy, but man rule under Satan against Theocracy by Chnst. We rejoice in the privilege of pointing out to the people the only remedy for world distress, and all the faithful publishers, many of whom are living under conditions of extreme poverty, general privation and climatic disabilities, are determined to fight for the King, Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah has enthroned, and, like the psalmist, say: ‘Though war should rise against us, in this will we be confident. . . . The Lord is our light and our salvation.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work concerning The Theocratic Government continues to make steady progress in Nyasaland. The average number of publishers has increased from 1,041 to 1,221, with a new peak of 1,428. Hours of field service totaled 598,279, during which 6,753 bound volumes and 33,773 booklets were placed. There were 40 phonographs in use, and the sound attendance totaled 226,104. Baek-calls numbered 45,943. All of these figures are much in excess of those for 1939. There are 60 company organizations. Three zone servants have heen active during the year, and provision has now heen made for other two to get going. The depot servant reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The people of this country are more ready, not only to give a hearing ear to the Kingdom message, hut also to DO something about it as well. Many hundreds are interested and the majority have remained just that, until the war started. This and other factors are forcing all who have a knowledge of the Truth to make a choice one way or the other; the awakening is here. The result is that Jehovah’s witnesses have their hands full and they are greatly encouraged to see their efforts bearing fruit. That which is contributing largely to the gathering of the “other sheep” is the back-call and sound-machine work. There are only about 40 gramophones in the country, but through them a tremendous witness is being given, while, concerning the back-call work, one company expresses the views of others when it writes: ‘At first we did not quite see the usefulness of the back-call arrangement, but now we realize just how necessary it is.’ This work is on the increase. One publisher tells of how the CN-‘Redemption’ record put to flight five Roman Cathohc native teachers and how they later caused a report to reach the ears of the District Commissioner that ‘someone with a gramophone was going around the villages telling the people that Armageddon is here and that all Europeans are going to be destroyed’, etc. The old, old dodge; but it did not work that time. It is somewhat stale now and growing whiskers! The investigations by the authorities proved the report to be incorrect, and that closed the matter. The ‘evil servant’ class does not like the gramophone and attempts to belittle the good work it does by declaring to the people that it is a 'sin for anyone to use an inanimate thing to preach the gospel of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom’. Needless to say, very few believe them. ‘Where there is the spirit of the Lord there is a way.’ This is demonstrated by the way some brethren up North set about finding the means to equip themselves with a gramophone. They buy a huge tree (choosing one near to a river, if possible), fell it, and float it down to their village. There they set about hollowing out the trunk and shaping it into a canoe, which, when completed, is sold to bring in the wherewithal to equip themselves with a gramophone. All this takes time, some months, in fact, and is hard work, but it means a phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Model Studies . Regular studies are held each week by the companies, and attending these are some 2,000 interested persons. Sometimes the brethren come across a village in which almost every person is interested and ready to fall in with the study arrangements explained to them. There has been a little difficulty here and there in obtaining permission to erect meeting-rooms for the use of the companies concerned. On one occasion the sub-headman of a village objected to Jehovah’s witnesses’ erecting a meeting-place because he persisted that there was no building-space left. Jehovah’s witnesses took the matter to the Native Authority’s court, but he upheld the sub-headman’s assertion. All this was then put before the District Commissioner by letter and, as other buildings were in the course of erection at the time of the sub-headman’s refusal, there remained no obstacle in the way really, and eventually the District Commissioner saw to it that justice was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Superstition: The stand that Jehovah’s witnesses take against having anything to do with the superstitions of their countrymen often shocks the susceptibilities of those concerned. Even in the witness work, superstition ranges itself against the friends; for, once, when a company of Jehovah’s witnesses were witnessing from village to village a lion followed in their wake, taking toll of village life. This caused the superstitious to blame Jehovah’s witnesses for bringing upon them the lion’s attentions! Love of indulging in the rites and ceremonies of religion, heathen or otherwise, without doubt keeps quite a number of people from taking a stand on the side of The Theocracy. The Roman Catholic knows just how attractive ‘mysterious’ ways, mutterings and ceremonies are to the superstitious ones, and so finds it an easy matter to prey upon their minds and to keep them in darkness as to the right way to go. One ‘ex-deaeon’ relates to a company of brethren an incident the gist of which is as follows: His brother died and about a week after his death he (the survivor) approached the Catholic priest asking him if he could give him any information concerning his brother. After a few moments’ thought and, after finding out that the deceased was ‘not too good a Catholic’, he told the survivor to return the following Sunday and to bring with him 5/- as an offering and for the release of his brother in the event of his being in the ‘purgatorial’ fires. The man borrowed 1/- from a friend, added thereto the remaining 4/-, and handed the sum over to the priest on the </span><span class="font5">following Sunday as requested. ‘Well,’ said the priest, ‘during the week we talked with the angels in heaven and found that your brother is in purgatory, but now that you have given this offering of 5/- he will be released therefrom and will on Tuesday reach heaven.’ This is so bald a statement of rubbish that it is hard to believe that anyone can swallow it; yet they do. The idea of ‘talking with the angels in heaven’ apparently catches their fancy. If the people would only realize with what class of angels the religionists commune they would perhaps shim them as they would the plague. Anyway, the ‘ex-deacon’ is now rejoicing in the knowledge of the Truth; for since that incident he has had his eyes opened to the false doctrines of the old dame and is busy telling others about the things he has learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The translator has been busy most of the year translating and correcting manuscripts returned to this depot. He has been able to do a little zone work as well, and is a diligent and faithful worker; his co-operation is appreciated, and he himself is ever thankful to the Lord for the privileges granted him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At the depot we have been busier than ever, and the fact that the depot servant is able to converse with the brethren in their own language has contributed to closer unity and more organization among the companies. Local </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font5"> leave this depot month by month, and the company servants have learned to transmit the instructions passed on to the publishers so that the Kingdom work may progress smoothly and as efficiently as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several European publishers who resided in Portuguese East Africa for a number of years have now returned to the Union, and this accounts for the decrease in literature placements. The number of African publishers has increased, the monthly average for the year just ended being 27, with a peak of 38. Hours of field service totaled 9,568, which is more than double the figure for last year. Bound volumes placed numbered 152, and booklets 436. Two phonographs were used; the sound attendance was 3,243, and 836 back-calls were made. The brethren are at four different centers, and one company servant also acts as zone servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Helena</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Owing to the extreme poverty of the islanders the phonograph continues to be the main line of attack. The two phonographs on the island were again put to good use, and 1,567 persons listened to the Kingdom message. The ten publishers spent 267 hours in field service and placed 132 booklets. Twenty-six back-calls were made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past year has been one of constant activity. Our hands have been kept full. We are glad of this, and it has afforded us great joy to receive and transmit the instructions coming from headquarters. Each one has gone about his assigned duties with singleness of purpose, and a spirit of unity and co-operation prevails. We greatly appreciate the efforts made by the brethren at Brooklyn to keep us supplied with literature in the 25 different languages required for this country. It has been a pleasure, too, to cooperate with the publishers in the field and to see that their requirements are met as expeditiously as possible. Letters received during the year totaled 9,450, and those sent out, 8,830. Local </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 7,420 were dispatched. The publication bimonthly of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in Afrikaans necessitated additional assistance for translation and printing, and the two brethren brought in in the latter part of the year for that purpose give a hand also with the increased work in the office and at the dispatch desk. The printing department reached a new high with 1,050,070 pieces, including 56,260 magazines, 3,000 booklets, 120,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> No 5, 744,160 leaflets, window cards, bookmarks, etc., and 126,650 pieces of office stationery. The dispatch desk sent out 7,804 parcels and 19,095 smgle copies of the journals. On our recording apparatus we made 1,004 twelve-inch records m Afrikaans, Cinyanja, Sesuto, Zulu, and Xosa, and these have found their way into all parts of the territory. The brethren m the office appreciate the privilege of field service, and a full share is taken in every part of the work, including the affairs of the Cape Town company. Notwithstanding increased duties in the office, we have actually bettered our time in the field, our individual average throughout the year being 34 5 hours and 7.5 back-calls per month. Time that was spent in street distribution of booklets last year has been devoted to magazine work this year, and it will be noted that our placement of magazines more than makes up for the shortage of booklets. New subscriptions to the number of 121 were obtained during the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign. The report follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the year we have heen greatly refreshed and strengthened by the steady flow of “food convenient” which has heen brought to us through the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> We give thanks to the Lord for the clearer light on the parable of “The Rich Man and Lazarus”, Zephaniah’s prophecy, and other scriptures which have been opened up. The experiences of our brethren in other lands as set forth in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> have also been a source of encouragement. We rejoice to be having a share in the fight and to know that the battle is being waged with increasing vigor in those countries where the totalitarian monstrosity has not yet managed to seize control. The brethren in the office and all the brethren in this country send you their love. Your boldness and fearlessness in the face of the enemy onslaught is a constant source of inspiration to us. We daily remember you at the Throne of Grace. The year 1940 has certainly been the most important thus far, but 1941 will be even more important, for Armageddon draws still nearer. We look forward to sharing in a wide distribution of the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> and other privileges in the coming year and also to the final victory which we know will be gained by the great Theocrat and his King, Christ Jesus. In the meantime be assured that we here will continue to devote all our strength to the service of The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s office at Lagos, Nigeria, in West Africa, has been working under much handicap during the year. The Roman Catholic influence, taking advantage of war conditions, has induced the customs officials to close down all importation of books. An order in council was issued preventing their further importation. The Society’s local servant had an interview with the governor, and, amongst other things, the governor expressed his great annoyance because of the expose of the Catholic Hierarchy as set forth in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> book. He claimed that the Hierarchy had</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">done good in Nigeria and therefore should not be exposed. In the face of all opposition the brethren have gone ahead with the work, using the ammunition they still have on hand. Jehovah’s witnesses have even been restricted in the use of gasoline more than anyone else in that part of the country. The faithful witnesses of the Kingdom have sent strong petitions to the Government in an effort to get the order in council amended. Let us hope that this may be done. A report from the Society’s servant says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It looks as if the totalitarian combine will soon swallow up the west coast of Africa. The people here are perplexed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report from West Africa was likewise held up by reason of the war conditions and the censoring of mail. Although working under great handicap the brethren in that land have been able to do a splendid work. Below is an extract from that report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With pleasure we send in our report for the fiseal year 1940. What a year! We commenced same with a service convention at Warri, a distance of over 400 miles from Lagos. It was a convention never to he forgotten. Publishers from all parts of Nigeria were present and worthily represented The Theocracy. The witness was thoroughly planned by the Warri company, and so thoroughly given in tliat district that even those in authority (Europeans) had to admit that the work was unique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch servant and his family had a miraculous escape while on their way to the convention, when the back tire burst, the car became uncontrollable, mounted a bank and overturned. The body of the ear was smashed beyond repair, but the occupants came off with slight injuries. The attempt of Satan to disrupt the proceedings of the convention was foiled, as everything came off successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately after the Warri convention a service campaign was arranged in Lagos, special features of which were information marches. The swarm of “locusts” took the religionists by storm. In other words, it was a real lightning attack. By it the people of good-will were greatly enlightened. Silent though the information marches be, they have proved to be the loudest method of revealing the fact that religion is a tremendous fraud, a snare, a racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the Lagos campaign said services were arranged in other towns and villages. The result has been a tremendous witness to the name of Jehovah and his King, and The Theocracy. Such sei vices have been the means of drawing those of good-will on the side of The Theocracy. It was in the month of March, when said information inarches had reached their heights m exposing the religious racket, that 15,450 of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> in Yoiuba arrived on the scene from headquarters in Brooklyn, N.Y. Thereupon the authorities (religionist) seized the opportunity to hold up the shipment, and afterwards <sup>1</sup> framed mischief by a law’ (Psalm 94: 20), prohibiting the importation of all Watch Tower books, documents, and newspapers into Nigeria. The &quot;order in council” was made on the 10th day of May, but deemed to have come into effect on the 13th day of Mai ch, because the Yoruba books entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> weie landed here on the 14th day of the same month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Petitions after petitions were sent by the various companies to the governor (who is invested with full powers at this juncture of the Empire) for the release of same. The reply to petitions was, to wit Said literature is undesirable in waitime, and therefore will not be released. Bp to date they are still lying in the custom warehouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A false report went forth from one of the dailies that the Watch Tower books were banned in Nigeria, and m spite of a correction issued a few days later by said editor, a few over-zealous district officers in the country parts, based on the false report published, ordered the arrest of the publishers for distributing the literature. In one place 32 were arrested, but, when taken before the magistrate, they were released. Even in Lagos a few of the police officers, ignorant of the law, made some arrests while the publishers were witnessing from house to house. After an interview by the branch servant with the head of the department, said officers were rebuked and warned not to interfere with the publishers m their carrying on their God-given rights Nevertheless, as a result of the banning of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> in Yoruba, the English edition is having a wide circulation. Satan the Devil always overreaches himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the restrictions on the work here, and on the Gold Coast, the brethren, in the face of difficulties, threats and ill-treatment, have not slackened their hands. In response to your letter of January, 1940, the publishers paid special attention to making back-calls, with the result of 10,367 in Nigeria alone, in contrast with 3,166 made in Gold Coast and Nigeria in the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your letter of March 11 did not go unheeded; we started the year with 53 pioneers on our list, two of whom have fallen asleep. Now we have 101 on our list. The number of publishers has also greatly increased, yet there is a decrease in the quantity of literature distributed in comparison with the previous year, due to the difficult time through which the people are passing. You will note, however, that the houis spent in active service show an increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What a rich dish the Father of all mercies supplied us through the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower!</span><span class="font5"> This year, we were feasting lavishly up to March, when the Board of Censors refused to release our </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> An interview was granted to the branch servant by the governor on request. As they touched on the release of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> he promised to give same his attention. While writing out this report news flashed through the papers that the order regarding Watch Tower books is amended. We are looking forward to better treatment from Governor Bourdillion, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., etc., who was on leave when the “order in council” was made against our publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Gold Coast</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our literature was prohibited since 1936 on the Gold Coast, but by the good-will of the comptroller of custom in Sekondi we managed to get in a good stock. That enabled the pioneers (many from Nigeria) and company publishers to carry on the work, until the outbreak of war, when drastic measures were taken by the Customs and Postal authorities throughout the colony, to see that no Watch Tower literature pass through. The pioneers who went from Nigeria had to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sierra Leone</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no prohibition of our literature m Sierra Leone. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> and the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font5"> are having a good circulation there, among a highly religious people. See Acts 17: 22 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham).</span><span class="font5"> The company at Freetown is leaving no stone unturned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In conclusion we would like to say that in spite of opposition and restrictions the work has progressed with joy during the year, as you will notice in the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total work done during the year in Nigeria is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total number of books placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14,634</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total number of booklets placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117,612</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total of literature placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132,246</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society, acting in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses, maintains its office at Buenos Aires, Argentina, and from there is conducted the work of Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, in South America. The Latin people are the chief inhabitants of that land, and the work is carried on chiefly in the Spanish language. Like almost all Latin countries, the people have long been kept in darkness by the influence and operation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and they have found it difficult to extricate themselves from this darkness, but the Lord is selecting his own, and those who are of honest heart and sincerely desire to know and to do his will And their way out of darkness into the light. Obstacles are put forth by the religionists to retard the work, and all this is done at the instance of our great enemy Satan, but in no way can Satan stop Jehovah from taking His message to those who have a desire to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s representative reports that many obstacles have been put in the way, many of the brethren arrested for preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, many being charged with being the “fifth column”, but, of course, none of them have been found guilty of being associated with the enemy. The Society’s local servant was haled before the authorities and required to make a statement of the purpose of the work which he carried on there; and this afforded an opportunity to give a good testimony before the authorities, even as the Lord Jesus had foretold should be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Paraguay the Catholic clergy became so angered at the lectures by electrical transcription broadcast concerning the “Trinity” and the doctrines of the Bible that the Hierarchy petitioned the Government to prohibit further activities of the witnesses. The one taking the lead in this assault upon Jehovah’s witnesses has ended his earthly course. So reports the local servant of the company at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Buenos Aires the brethren had difficulty in finding a permanent place in which to meet, and under the Lord’s direction they built their own hall and now continue to have their meetings and study without further difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A summary of the witness work accomplished in the four countries above mentioned is set out below.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>AUSTRALASIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s office at Sydney, Australia, reporting for Australia, New Zealand, and other outlying countries directed from the Sydney office, is very gratifying for the year. The war has, of course, hindered them somewhat. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has shown more bitter opposition than ever before, the dividing of the people is rapidly taking place, and it is easy to determine who are the “goats” and who are the “sheep”. The work during the year has increased over the year previous in the face of all opposition. All mail from Australia is now censored, and even the reports coming through have portions clipped out, so it is impossible for us to tell just everything that is going on there in connection with Jehovah’s work. Books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year, so far as reported from the Sydney office, are 1,364,129, a healthy increase over the previous year. From the report of the Society’s servant at Sydney the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Magazine placements are almost doubled, the number being 496,601, to compare with 264,531 of the year previous. This output has certainly brought the ire of the enemy to the fore and at the same time has helped many hundreds of people of good-will to take their stand for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the present moment we are receiving much newspaper publicity in one of the lower-class &quot;rags” of the country, with the result that we are being brought more prominently before the people. This is having the effect of making a marked division, and the indications are that in the near future there will be a definite surge from religion of people seeking The Theoeiaey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The usual written report and figures will be sent on immediately they can be finally compiled. I will see that they are not delayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Copy of the new booklet has arrived and is indeed appreciated. I am delighted to see this new angle of attack on the religious stronghold and am eagerly awaiting stocks of the booklet so that we can get busy here with a super-campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point a paragraph in the report manifestly referring to the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses has been removed by the censor. It must have been too warm about that season to permit it to pass through. The mangled report contains the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Farms</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the convention many of the brethren throughout Australia have signified their desire to either give their farms to the Society or work them under our control. Some of the brethren have excellent properties, which, when worked under proper Theocratic conditions, will prosper to the honor of Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil’s crowd are making trouble for many of the brethren in secular work, and I had in mind that we might be able to help them by having these farms on which they could work for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since I wrote for permission to print </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> here, the Government have passed a law forbidding the commencement of any further periodicals until the war is over, the reason being that paper is rationed and they do not consider it fair to allow any new journals to begin. I have pushed our case, however, and the prospects at the moment are good. The Department is considering the matter, which if decided in our favor will mean that we can import the necessary paper and proceed with the printing of the magazine here. I will report again on this as soon as word comes through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enemy, wor</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font5">g through the Hierarchy as usual, is endeavoring to cause trouble here. I have sent H. E. Gill over, who you will remember was a good fighter in the Eiji case, and I think we shall be able to overcome the difficulties. In any event it will mean a good witness, and that is our main concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Islands</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Thailand is going on particularly well. We had an excellent report from Brother Sewell, who is working in Thailand (Siam). Chiengmai is one of the northern provinces of the state, and it is there that the brethren have found particular interest in the Kingdom message. The following is an extract from the letter recently received:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The study that was started by our brethren in Chiengmai is being kept up by the interested ones there and at the same time those interested ones are pushing the translation of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> book. One who is the head lady teacher in the Girls’ Mission School wrote in here the last week to say that they will be sending in finished portions shortly for checking up. The missionaries are kicking about the truth being made known and even censoring the girls’ mail to see how much they are helping the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom work. A young Thai who is a colporteur for the American Bible Society has shown some interest lately and last Sunday came out with us in the boat, did some witnessing and acted as interpreter for Bro. Fran-ciseus. At the conclusion of the day this young fellow said he had never had a day like it in his life. He had to leave next morning on a country trip which will keep him away three weeks, and will come to me as soon as he returns. He is trying to make up hiB mind about pioneer service; he can see that religion is a racket. There aie other interested ones showing up now in Bangkok, mainly Chinese. The territory is much more interesting to work the second tune, and we are sure there will soon be a big increase here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I quote from a letter recently received from one of the pioneers wor</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font5">g m Thailand:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A Thai sister from Chiengmai, Sister Bua Keo, is now pioneering with Willy and Koon Lon. Chomchai will be free from the 27th of this month. The sister Bua Keo was a nurse in the mission hospital, and she gave one week’s notice to the mission and went straight into pioneer service. The missionaries are very angry and write letters to her trying to bring her back. She is determined to go on pioneering. Willy’s group are now going to work the eastern territory; it has never been done before and none of us have ever been out that way; they are going to see what can be done towards getting some studies and publishers going in the bigger towns on that line as has been done in the north. The pioneer girl is very keen to get amongst the Thai Christians on that line and has the zeal to start the studies off. Two of the Presbyterian teachers in Bangkok attended the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study last Sunday and are coining again next Sunday. They are against the mission for having circulated the last leaflet against our work. The leaflet is so plainly false that it is doing more good for the truth than harm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I recently received a letter from Brother John who went to Shanghai and has now, as far as we know, gone to Hong Kong. We are not able to get much information from that direction on account of the delicate situation between the nations in the East. He reports that the company at Shanghai has now overcome the difficulties caused when Prank Dewar was there and that they are working smoothly and accomplishing much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chinese edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> has begun and appears to be a job worthy of The Theocracy. The brethren were intending to send us a set of mats for each issue, so that we could run a few off here if necessary. Unfortunately the duty on mats is very high (£29 per </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> issue) and therefore the idea is impractical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have already asked both Brothers Schuett and John to give you a full report on activities there direct, and hope by this time that they have done that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren at Batavia, which is really the central office for the East and directly responsible to this office, has been doing good work. The boys there have plenty of initiative and have now procured a small printing plant for their needs, same being provided and paid for by the local friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A party of pioneers from Java went to Sumatra and have been having a wonderful time in the Lord’s work there. Where formerly there was no organized company, the brethren have gathered together a number of interested people at Medan and have organized them for field service. The pioneers were there for the Memorial. After the celebration a resolution was adopted in which the brethren asked that their love and very best wishes be conveyed to yourself. They report that the interested in all parts of the island have now been contacted and that the work there is definitely established to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren here at the office are just beginning to recover from the convention, which was the greatest of all time. Reports coming in from companies who were represented show clearly that the brethren are imbued with the spirit to fight. The enemy is feverishly trying to take advantage of war conditions to fight The Theocracy, but we know that they shall not prevail. All divisions of the organization proceed with full power ahead. The new year just commenced will undoubtedly be the best for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mails from overseas are somewhat irregular, but we hope that, with the inauguration of the new direct air mail to New Zealand, conditions will improve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Copy of a leaflet printed and distributed in Sydney prior to the convention is enclosed herewith. That together with the fact that we acted in the same manner as Headquarters in regard to the releasing of information as to where the Theocratic Convention was to be held, shows clearly the Lord’s direction, in which we rejoice. Looking forward to a full report in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font5"> and elsewhere of the convention held at Detroit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were able to contact one of the visiting journalists who covered the convention at Detroit. While he could not say very much as to the happenings, he stated that it was one of the most orderly gatherings that he had ever visited. We were able to give him a good witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The family join in sending their love to associated ambassadors at the American Embassy and to yourself. Rejoicing with you in your bold stand for The Theocracy and against the enemy organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Note that in the second to the last paragraph of the report above quoted attention is called to a leaflet distributed throughout Sydney. This leaflet relates to the efforts put forth by the Hierarchy and other fifth columnists to deprive Jehovah’s witnesses of holding a convention in Australia. The leaflet speats for itself and is inserted herein. That part of the report from the Society's office in Sydney which was deleted and which manifestly referred to the convention evidently set forth the facts showing how the “fifth column” Hierarchy contingent had failed. The hand of the Lord is not shortened: “Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.” (Isaiah 59:1) Opposition to the Lord’s kingdom only whets the desire of honest people to know the truth; and the truth they are getting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Convention of Jehovah’s Ambassadors will be held at 7 Bet esford Road, Strathfield, S.'S W, July 2i-2S, ISiO</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Calling All Catholics, Protestants, Jews and People of Good Will I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Australians will read this leaflet. These hundreds of thousands now stand face to face with the greatest opportunity ever placed before human creatures, that of enjoying life and happiness on earth under the righteous Kingdom of God Jehovah instructs the obedient ones that they might receive comfort and be strong in hope The Theocratic Convention is provided as a means of instruction for the many persons who seek refuge from the impending disaster at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Enemies of Almighty God</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In the time of Jesus the religious Fifth Column of self-righteous Pharisees hounded our Master from pillar to post, and as a result it was said, “The Son of man hath not where to lay his head.” In these modern days, the Jesuitized Fifth Column of Australia has white-anted the structure of the nation to such an extent that the Christians known as Jehovah’s witnesses have been denied every suitable hall in Sydney for their convention. The same Jesuit organization which boasted the banning of Judge Rutherford from the Sydney Town Hall, and which raised no objection to the use of that hall by Fifth Columnist Von Luckner, has now clamped down on the majority of hall owners in Sydney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall the enemies of God’s Kingdom succeed in their efforts to suppress the truth? Never! Jehovah God, through his prophet Jeremiah, foretells the outcome of such opposition in these words: “They shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” Let the newspapers of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy rage against Jehovah’s ambassadors and let the priests of Sydney ban every hall in the city, BUT THE THEOCRATIC CONVENTION WILL BE' HELD; for are determined that the thousands of people of good-will in this city shall be given the opportunity of learning about the righteous Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The world convention center Is Columbus, Ohio, U. S. A., from which point Judge Rutherford will speak on Sunday, July 28, taking as his subject </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Religion as a Wobld Remedy”.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Arrangements are well in hand at the Sydney headquarters for catering for the many persons who will want to receive instruction concerning God’s kingdom on this occasion. The Sunday afternoon should witness one of the most joyful gatherings of Christian people yet seen in this land You are invited to be in attendance at the Theocratic Convention m order that you may see for yourself tljat Jehovah’s ambassadors are not a sect or cult, but true Christians united in the service of Jehovah God These are poles apart from the religious “Fifth Column” movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jesuitized Fifth Column</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It is of interest to note that the most hated man in Europe, Germany’s Fuehrer, was hoisted to power by the Jesuits. Hitler’s first successes were in Bavaria, the most Catholic part of Germany. Thyssen, the German steel magnate, has recently admitted the secret meetings which took place between Hitler and the German representative of the Papal nuncio, a Jesuit, and which bore fruit in an agreement to the effect that the Catholic Church would not be harmed by the Nazi regime. This agreement has been honored Followed the coalition between the Catholic Centrum Party, headed by Fifth Columnist von Papen, and the Nazis, and Hitler was elected the “constitutional” dictator of Germany. The Vatican quickly engineered a Concordat with the Nazi State, which agreement is in existence to this day, and is confirmed each year by the childish exchanging of birthday greetings between Hitler and the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Betrayal of Austrians and Czechs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1938, the traitor von Papen was appointed ambassador to the Austrian government, and succeeded quickly in establishing the Fifth Column organization. The Anschluss or “selling out” of Austria to Germany was accomplished without bloodshed and was marked by the willing co-operation of Cardinal Innitzer, who instructed Catholics to vote for Hitler at the Plebiscite The London </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> admits that on Hitler’s birthday, Innitzer ordered all Austrian churches to ring bells, fly the Swastika flag and say special prayers for the Fuehrer. The Fifth Column does things that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">When Hitler style Czechoslovakia, he was ably assisted by the Catholic prelate Hilgenrainer, who worked “in the dark”, and by the more open Henlein who boasted that he would destroy the regime of the Protestant liberator, Huss. The dpal was clinched when Fifth-Columnist Prelate Tiso sold Slovakia to the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Wrecking Poland and France</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On the occasion of the march on Poland, the Catholic bishops of Germany issued a pastoral letter admonishing “our Catholic soldiers to do their duty in obedience to the Fuehrer”. This was reported in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Vatican admits sending a special envoy to Warsaw to mediate in the partition of Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It is significant that the man appointed as Fascist puppet governor of the remains of France is Petain, a close friend of Jesuitized General Franco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The manner in which Catholic authorities have freely admitted their accoid with the dictators is most remarkable In its issue of May 5, 1939, the London </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Hei aid</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> went so far as to publish a photo of Hitler leaving a Catholic church, and then devoted much space to an incitement of assault upon Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1940—The American Zero Hour</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Evidence piling up hourly shows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is determined that the United States shall go “totalitarian” this year. Even humble, God-fearing Catholic persons are horrified as they see the faithless acts of their leligious leaders Pressure exerted for years upon the president finally resulted in his sending to the Vatican a Fascistic admirer of Mussolini as his personal ambassador to the pope. “The Holy Father has not condemned Fascism as such,” says a Vatican mouthpiece </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Out Sunday Visitor, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic weekly), “and neither have we . . . The church can get along with a totalitarian ruler if he grants the church full libeity ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In the United States, in 1936, two Catholic priests, Charles E. Coughlin and Patrick Henry O’Brien (in his Jesuit-inspired letter to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">IS Aurora,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Philadelphia), publicly expressed their conviction that in 1940 the Catholic Hierarchy would be in the saddle m that country. There is much evidence that such is a fact Coughlin then expected that in 1940 his “Christian Front” would put aside ballots and use bullets and ‘fight in Franco’s way’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Already In America the Catholic Hierarchy is using the American Legion and allies to gain its ends Here is one of many examples:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In Texas, during May and June, 1940, mobs formed and directed by members of the “patriotic” self-styled American Legion openly attacked Jehovah’s witnesses at many places. At Odessa, Texas, about 70 innocent men, women and children were hauled into the courtroom by the sheriff and county attorney, held until midnight without food or water, ard then the 35 men weie packed into a small upper room for the rest of the night. During five hours from midnight they were brought downstairs, one by one, and grilled by the American Legion Purposely deprived of food and dnnk until ten o’clock Sunday morning, they were then loaded on a truck and carried to the county line, delivered to a mob of a thousand, guided by and including the American Legion, who stoned and drove them on foot along the railroad right-of-way for over five miles. They were prevented from leaving the right-of-way to get water; a number fainted and had to be carried by their companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Catholic Action” Identified</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Talcing all in all and calmly considering the facts, we are irresistibly forced to the conclusion that the subversive element, the Fifth Column, is nothing more nor less than Jesuitism and “Catholic Action”, the ally ot totalitarian rulers in turning this world into a Nazi prison which exalts itself against the name of God and demes Christians the nght to worship Jehovah in spmt and in truth The conflict between totalitarian religion and Christianity is borne out by the words of a Catholic priest, published in the newspaper </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The German ~Way,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> under date of May 29, 1938:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“When Adolph Hitler came to power and the Geiman episcopate repeated their request, Hitler said • ‘These so-called Jehovah’s witnesses are tioublemakers ; ... I do not tolerate that the German Catholics be besmirched in such a manner by this American “Judge” Rutherford; I dissolve Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany.’ ” Immediately thereafter more than six thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses were herded into concentration camps, where they have since lived under the lash of cruel guards, and a number have been shot because they firmly choose to obey Almighty God and Christ Jesus and refuse to “Heil Hitler’’,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Has Australia a “Fifth Column”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">During the War of 1914-18, the present attorney-general threatened action against the Roman Catholic archbishop of Melbourne, because of the latter’s political viewpoint. Today, the same foreign power which has built the German monster is literally thriving in our midst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us revert again to the subject of banned halls. The Newcastle Town Hall was closed to Jehovah’s witnesses in May, 1939, due to the action of a mayor (now out of office) who some months earlier had sanctioned the use of the same hall for the purpose described in this press despatch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The New Year was ■welcomed with gaiety at the dance of the Catholic Young Men’s Society in the supper room of the City Hall on Saturday night. Danceis goose-stepped aiound the room and saluted the New Year with full Fascist honors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In September, 1939, the mayor of Toowoomba canceled the contract with Jehovah’s witnesses for that city’s hall, and admitted that he had done so at the “suggestion” of the Catholic bishop. It may be that some good-spin ted person or persons will provide the means wheieby a hall for worship of Jehovah can be built in Sydney by Jehovah’s witnesses themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Honest Catholics Are Not to Blame</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Fifth Column is a product of the Church political, that is, of Jesuitism. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses are at present to be found in the Catholic organization itself, and these honest ones will be only too willing to cast aside religion when they perceive that religion is the enemy of mankind It is to these people, and, in fact, to </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">all</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> lovers of righteousness in </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">eveby</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> denomination, that Jehovah’s witnesses now extend the invitation to be present at the Theocratic Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who have the Nazi spirit and are bent on doing injury to others or disturbing the peace of others will not be welcome. This convention will be for the purpose of doing good to all persons who desire to see peace and righteousness prevail in the earth and who desire to see justice administered to all. Everyone who attends the Theocratic Convention will say as the psalmist did: “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.” —Psalm 23:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dividing the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hysteria of mob violence has seized upon many parts of the United States of America Harmless persons are assaulted and mobbed because they decline to obey the demands of fanatical persons. Their houses are broken open, burned to the ground; they are thrown into prison; they are driven like dumb brutes through the heat The mobs are incited to do this work by religious leaders and others who claim to be great patriots of the nation. Engaged in these mobs are public officials who, because of influence exercised over them by the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, and because of their desire for political advantage, violate their oath of office, ill-treat and abuse citizens who are doing no wrong, and wink at wicked acts of Nazis and others who engage in a conspiracy against the government This class is for lawlessness, wickedness, violence. The same subversive class is now assaulting the stronghold of Australian freedom. Its methods are identical with those employed in America, and it is supported in its attacks by the well-known “gutterpress” of Australia and New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On the other hand there is a class of people who are honest and sincere, who believe in Almighty God and His Son Christ Jesus, and are in favor of freedom of speech and freedom of worship, regardless of who the person may be or what his belief may be. These seek the welfare of the people in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why are these two classes so prominently brought to the fore today’ More than nineteen centunes ago Jesus answered that question (Matthew 25’31-46), in substance thus: That at His second coming the nations would be gathered before Him and He would divide the workers of wickedness and put them on His 'left, and designate them as “goats”, separating them from those who love righteousness, and who are called “sheep”. This great prophecy is now in course of fulfillment The division is leading up to the great climax that will result in the most severe distress and trouble the world has ever known</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In all the Latin countries there appears to be a smaller percentage of the people who earnestly seek to know Jehovah and his King. The masses have so long been kept in darkness that it is difficult for many of them to break away. That condition exists in Brazil. But in the face of all this and of the generally disturbed conditions during the past year the work in Brazil has gone forward with greater zeal and the number that are turning to the King and the Kingdom are on the increase. The “goats” manifest themselves with more bitterness, while the “sheep” of the Lord turn with grateful hearts to him and seek refuge under his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Society’s local servant and representative the following extracts from the report are sent out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a real joy and a precious privilege to submit the following report, which recounts the good tilings we have received at Jehovah’s hand. Our hearts truly rejoice in the salvation of his people from the snare of the enemy, and we give thanks to Him for another year of rich blessings in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has given increase to the pubheation of The Theocracy in this territory during the past year, according to his faithful promise, and that in the midst of more difficulties and persecution than the service in Brazil had suffered to the present time. While it is true that this country is not at present one of the warring nations, the war’s effect is, nevertheless, felt here in a decided way in that (a) the cost of living for the people is increased in order to support the increasing military and other preparations for war, (b) distrust, suspicion and hysteria increase, calling forth the enactment of more stiin-gent laws to control the people, and (e) the Hierarchy’s agents, improving every opportunity, use the same to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of all their opponents, and especially against the publishers of The Theocracy, which is their mortal enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Goal Reached</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Based upon the activity of the previous year and relying upon Jehovah’s promise to grant the unselfish desires of his children, a goal was set for increase of publishers in the field. 200 was considered a reasonable expectation, 50 of them pioneers. This goal was passed in April with 218 publishers reporting, and while 48 is the largest number of pioneers reporting activity in any one month, there were actually enrolled 68 when the year ended. This was a decided increase in the number of publishers over the previous year’s total of 114, and the number of pioneers was more than three times the 19 of the previous year. As a natural sequence the number of field hours was substantially increased, from 45,454 in 1939 to 72,685 in 1940. Back-calls increased from 235 in 1939 to 1,363 in 1940. A decided increase in the number of back-calls was noted after the companies received the letter of January 20 written by the president of the Society, calling attention to our privileges in regard to back-calls and our responsibility to the people of good-will. The output of literature from the branch office increased as follows:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1938-39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9,370</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1939-40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19,268</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Booklets Total Lit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">186,973 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196,343</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">207,344 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;226,612</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">This increase does not show in the publishers’ reports which, while showing a large increase in the number of bound books placed, indicate that there were slightly fewer booklets placed. This is probably due to the interruption for nearly a month in June, and because the decided increase in output from the branch office in the past few months does not yet appear in the publishers’ field reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only has the number of pioneers substantially increased, but these publishers, especially the native Brazilians, have shown the proper spirit of ‘ ‘ feeding the sheep ’ ’ of the Lord, and have voluntarily left the larger centers, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, where their creature comforts were, perhaps, more, to go to distant places and gather together and help those of good-will who are seeking the way to the Kingdom. Jehovah has greatly blessed their nn selfish efforts, for where they have gone others are joi</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font5">g in the field service and entering the pioneer work, some among them being new ones, and others who, being alone, had cooled and grown weak. Small but active groups for study and for witnessing have been formed in Recife, Manaos and Santos. As a result of the pioneer activity, the Kingdom witness is now being actively carried on in 15 of the 23 states and territories of Brazil</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Organized companies have increased from 12 in 1939 to 15 this year; not a large increase in number of groups, but in all of them there is a more active participation in the Kingdom witness work, a careful study of organization instructions in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> use of the testimony card and phonographs, and more attention paid to back-calls. Some real progress has been evidenced in all respects, especially in the conduct of studies in harmony with the Society’s outline. The most noticeable progress has been that of the company m Sao Paulo. Until March of this year the company met in a hall furnished them in the building occupied by the branch office. This they outgrew and, after some effort, a suitable building with an entire floor for the exclusive use of the company was located in the heart of the central business section of the city. The brethren themselves worked hard to make some necessary alterations, clean and paint and furnish with good chairs to be ready for the first meeting at the time of the Memorial, when a convention was held. This Kingdom Hall of the Sao Paulo company has been blessed of the Lord. The attendance at the study meetings averages between 60 and 70, after the departure of about 20 to give the Kingdom witness in other places where it had not yet been given; a number of Jonadabs have been immersed and at least 10 of their number have entered the pioneer service. It is a real inspiration to attend the sei vice and study meetings and see their joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the compames, there are scattered throughout the land isolated brethren, most of them farmers, who are giving the witness as best they can. They receive monthly the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> either in Portuguese or, in the few cases in which they do not readily understand Portuguese, in their native language. Their reports sent in each month show that they, too, as part of the organization, ai e doing their best to keep high the standard of The Theocracy. Their physical burdens increase as taxes mount higher and resti lotions are placed on what they may or may not plant, but their joy increases as they realize the nearness of the time when The Theocracy shall fully function, adjusting all things for the benefit of the humble, honest dwellers of earth who are obedient to the laws of the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reports to the office indicate that at least 75 were immersed during the year, and of this number 15 have already entered the pioneer ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work at the office increased considerably as the number of pioneers trebled, and also more printing was done than in any previous year. This has meant extra hours of service for our family of seven. All have joyfully participated in this increased service as an evidence from Jehovah of his favor and blessing upon previous service faithfully performed, and, in addition, have, without exception, had a good share in the field service. The brethren fiom the office have been of assistance to the local company. Two of them have served as zone servants, visiting the companies and helping them to a better organization and unity in harmony with the local branch and the world-wide organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to translating monthly and publishing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Ata-laia,</span><span class="font5"> the Portuguese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and selections from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> to make up the Portuguese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao,</span><span class="font5"> there were translated in the office and forwarded to Brooklyn the two books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> and the booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees, Neutrality, </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Angels.</span><span class="font5"> With your permission, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> No. 1 was also translated into Portuguese and printed on our own little press. The 2,000 copies that you authorized us to print are about ready for distribution as this report goes forward. It is expected that this booklet in Portuguese will be a great help in the studies with the “Exposed” series of lectures. We have heretofore used the Spanish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklet. While many Brazilians who can read understand Spanish, it is quite difficult for some others to read any other than Portuguese, especially among the less educated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were much in need of new types for the press, and the Lord put it into the hearts of some of the local brethren to furnish the money to buy these, and they were put in use about the time that we changed the name of the Portuguese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Torre de Vigia</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Atalaia.</span><span class="font5"> This has helped us to speed up the printing and has considerably improved the appearance of our journals and other printed matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklet printed here, we have received from Brooklyn the following booklets new: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace, Refugees, Angels,</span><span class="font5"> and now a second printing of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace, Uncovered,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While it was not possible for most of us to attend the marvelous Theocratic Convention in Detroit, one of the Kingdom publishers who did attend has brought us back a refreshing report of the love and sweetness and zeal manifested throughout that great assembly, with the account of how the Lord’s hand stayed every effort of the adversary to interfere, so that in no instance did ‘they prevail’ against The Theocracy. We are already feasting upon “Times and Seasons” in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and await eagerly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font5"> for further details of the crowning event of the Lord’s service for 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publication of the Kingdom message infuriates the enemy, who then tries frantically to stop it and to destroy those who publish The Theocracy. So it has been in Brazil during the past year. The Catholic papers have again and again .published the he that the work of the Society is connected with Communism. They have publicly denounced Jehovah’s witnesses as Communists, warning Protestants as well as Catholics to avoid or mistreat the Lord’s representatives, and to refuse to read the books which these messengers of Jehovah bring to them. Secretly they, together with their Protestant allies, have induced the authorities to persecute and jail the Kingdom publishers, sometimes on one charge, sometimes on another. The greatest persecution has been heaped upon those brethren who are not native Brazilians. Some of the German pioneers have been refused permanent residence in Brazil, have been jailed, some threatened with deportation, and two of them have actually been deported, all for no other &quot;crime” than that they were preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On May 31, at the close of a month of the greatest activity, notice was received that the Minister of Justice ordered the Society dissolved and its work stopped. Guards were stationed at the gate to see that the Society was not functioning. For nearly a month the office was almost “incommunicado”, until a formal protest could be filed with the Brazilian authorities. When the older was given to dissolve the Society no reason was assigned for the action, but later, in conference with the office of the Minister of Justice, representatives of the Society were told that the objection to the Society was because it was an American organization and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">anti-Fascist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is much evidence to prove that this attempt to stop the publication of The Theocracy comes from the Hierarchy’s agents, and while no pains are spared to properly inform the authorities, who have been so sadly misinformed as to the purpose of our work, this &quot;strange work” of Jehovah proceeds, because it is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His.</span><span class="font5"> Through the office of the late Mr. Bankhead, speaker of the House of Representatives, the situation of the Society and its representatives in Brazil was called to the attention of the State Department in Washington. Also, because on one pretext or other, the branch servant m Brazil was being threatened with arrest or being called to explain to the chief of police his actions, an injunction suit was entered in the Brazilian courts to stop such annoyance. Within the past month the guards have been withdrawn from the house. The Minister of Justice has not yet acted upon our request for reconsideration of his former action against the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the meantime the number of pioneers is trebled, and those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are being satisfied at the Lord’s gracious hand. The effect of the persecution is to stir to greater zeal the faithful, who realize that the time is short before Armageddon and that, to have a share in the witness work, they must bestir themselves now. Some who had long known the Truth but who, for one reason or another, had stood aside, have again become active, entering into the service with greater zeal and joy than ever. The religionists have fled from the organization, leaving the others in peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the midst of tribulation and dangers on all sides, but with great joy and peace and confidence in Jehovah, who has marvelously led and abundantly fed us during another year, the publishers of The Theocracy in Brazil, with hearts rejoicing in the salvation of Jehovah, look eagerly forward to continue the witness to the honor of his name until he shall say that it is finished, then to the destruction of Satan and all his wicked hosts in Armageddon, to victory and vindication for the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sweet, close relationship of this branch with the headquarters in Brooklyn seems sweeter and closer in these days of mutual joys and activity in the service of The Theocracy, of mutual bearing of reproach and suffering for Jehovah’s name’s sake. The branch family desire me to express to you our appreciation for your loving ministration for our needs, both physical and spiritual, which, as the Lord’s servant and the servant of your brethren, you have untiringly performed. We love you and we love to serve in Jehovah’s organization with you. We pray that Jehovah may grant you renewed strength, physical and spiritual, directing you with heavenly wisdom as we continue for yet a little while in this, his “strange work”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The report of the progress of the witness work in British Guiana may be seen from the Society’s local servant’s report as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In presenting our Annual Report for 1940 we desire to express our gratitude and appreciation to our loving Father for the many evidences of his care and protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We also wish to rejoice with our brethren abroad who count it a privilege to suffer crucially for righteousness’ sake, and to continually pray Jehovah’s blessing on them, and, indeed, on his work and all his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have pleasure in reporting a further increase in activity in service as compared with previous years. It will be noted that there has been a decrease in the sound attendance, but tjiis is due to the fact that we did not have the use of Brother Talma’s sound machine as in 1939. The brethren have endeavored to offset this by increased activity with, portable phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are now rejoicing m reading the experiences of our brethren at the Detroit convention, which we were unable to attend in person. Truly the Lord is blessing his people with vision and courage at the present tune.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Regardless of the opposition put forth in Demerara against the Lord’s people the distribution of literature there during the past year has exceeded that of any previous year, and thus the evidence is given that amidst great persecution the Lord continues to bless his people in their effort to witness to the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">By far the majority of the citizenry of Canada are democratic. They believe in freedom of speech and freedom of worship and freedom of assembly, but the majority are not in control. The official element of Canada today is under the power and control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which is strongly Fascist throughout that country. During the World War the Catholic Fascists opposed a compulsory selection of an army and defeated the Selective Draft Act. The fact is that Quebec and her Catholic population have never vigorously supported Great Britain although it is part of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The evidence strongly points to the fact that when the time came to raise an army by compulsory selection or draft in Canada the Roman Catholic Hierarchy saw their opportunity to do great injury to the witness work concerning Jehovah’s kingdom. There is much evidence that a compromise was made and that in consideration of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy supporting the Selective Draft Act in Canada Jehovah’s witnesses were to be put out of business. Consequently an order in council was made dissolving Jehovah’s witnesses as an illegal organization. That order in council is silly and ludicrous. How could a puny human power stop the work of Almighty God? Those who represent Jehovah and proclaim his message are his witnesses. They are not the witnesses of any man. Jehovah the Almighty God has selected them and sent them forth. It is true that they, being human creatures on earth, are subject to the same frailties of others and the opposition put forth against them by the enemies of God and his kingdom retards their work. God could stop this opposition, of course, but he permits it, to give the enemies of his government full opportunity to identify themselves as enemies and fit for destruction at the great battle of Armageddon. He also permits it to test the faith and integrity of his servants. As well try to stop the water from flowing down the St. Lawrence as to stop those who are devoted to God from giving testimony to his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the office of the Society has been closed in Canada and those in charge scattered throughout the land, the Lord has seen to it that many of the facts concerning the work in Canada during the fiscal year have come to the main office, and we set forth in this report these facts in so far as it is possible. The report, therefore, covers chiefly the facts as they occurred prior to the order in council; but even since the order in council was made faithful servants of Jehovah God take opportunity to talk to the people about the Kingdom, and the evidence shows that great numbers of people are embracing the Kingdom message and devoting themselves to Almighty God and his King. The work of Jehovah is called a “strange work”, in the Scriptures, and indeed it is strange to those who do not appreciate the goodness of the Lord; and when that “strange work” is finished his “strange act” will follow, and then righteousness will have come to stay for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s strange work continues in Canada. Nothing on earth or in heaven can prevent the Almighty from accomplishing His purposes, and it is our confidence that the witness work in that land will be done even if Jehovah has to use the “very stones to cry out”. His work is not accomplished by the will of men, nor by the arm of flesh, and it is not dependent upon any creature. To express the words of the yeartext, “My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation.” Jehovah’s salvation with full deliverance must be very near, and his witnesses earnestly look forward to and pray for the great battle of Armageddon to begin, which will bring down the religionists from their lofty place, and bring shame and destruction to those who reproach our Father’s holy name, and who persecute His innocent children. Then God will exalt the righteous, and give the Kingdom to the saints of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such recognize the King, Christ Jesus, as the rightful ruler of earth, and the great Theoerat’s choice, and they hail him above all, looking to the time when 'unto Him every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that He is the Lord, to the glory of God’. Their hearts also rejoice in the rich provisions the Great Provider has made for His flock inside the fold. They thank Jehovah with all their hearts for the rich and bountiful supply of food placed upon the table; this has made them “strong in the Lord, and m the power of His might”. They can enter into the experiences of the psalmist, when he said: “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. . . . Thou prepares! a table before me m the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over.” And “goodness and mercy shall follow [us] all the days of [our] life, and [we] will dwell in the house of [Jehovah] for ever”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such also express joy in being associated so closely with the Brooklyn office. The Lord has not left them in doubt, but has always been at their right hand, and when they may have come to a fork in the roads, and not known which is the right way to take, the voice behind has said, “This is the way. Walk ye in it.” Never has the direction of the Lord’s organization failed, and they acknowledge and appreciate fully every gracious blessing which has come to them in this war, through the faithful ministration of the brethren m the office at Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enemies of the truth in that land thought to stop Jehovah ’s work being done, and it is true they have placed a mighty obstacle in the path. The religionists were determined to stop the work. This expression was used in many parts of the land “It must be stopped.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the opposition to the work had been increasing in the Province of Quebec, and every move against the faithful in that province filled them with greater zeal to accomplish His work. Eventually, in the city of Montreal, Quebec Province, a jury of one of the courts recommended to the Chief Justice that immediate action be taken against the executive of this organization so that this work would be stopped. A judge, in the same Province, said that it was “a good thing that the author of this book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[Enemies]</span><span class="font5"> had not met a good Anglican or a good Catholic with a horse whip”, stating, “It must be stopped.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This provided a real opportunity for giving a further witness; the whole country was covered with a tract entitled “It Must Be Stopped”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How they were going to stop the witness being given was a problem. The religionists must have conspired together to see how they could bring this work to a close, so preventing the witnesses from moving freely amongst the people. Their opportunity came with the increased hostilities in Europe during the present war. With the announcements in the public press of the war and its reverses to the allies came their opportunity to further their wicked schemes and so crush every organization against them; this means particularly the schemes of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Nobody in that land had exposed their duplicity, hypocrisy and wickedness as had Jehovah’s witnesses, and it was the witnesses they were after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First the Government declared illegal about sixteen organizations, such as the Communists. As the war in Europe grew more critical, further agitation was raised in the House of Commons at Ottawa against unpatriotic and subversive organizations Some members were doing their utmost to show their patriotism by working injuiy to others. Such minds could be used very easily by the Devil and his created organization Roman Catholic Hierarchy) to commit the act of working against God by stopping this work done by Jehovah’s witnesses in the land of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this time, when the Government was taking action against certain organizations throughout Canada, our religious enemy was forcing the position against us in the Provinces of Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, British Columbia and some parts of Ontario. Whilst this furor was being raised against us, the Province of Quebec, where all this dirty work was originating, kept silent. It appeared the growing opposition to our work was not coming from Quebec, but from other provinces. Then Doctor Bruce, member for Parkdale, Toronto, made a statement in the House to the effect that the Government had not gone far enough in their list of illegal organizations, but should have included many more, and amongst which he named Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Realizing some action might be taken by the Government, legal counsel was immediately sought, and so to grapple with the situation. It was fully expected by our counsel and others that, before the Government took any action against Jehovah’s witnesses, there would be inquiry re the organization, its work, teachings, etc., by the committee which had been set up by the Government to revise the Defence of Canada Regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately the work began of preparing a brief outlining fully the organization and its teachings, activity, etc., and it was the expectation that a representative of the Society would be privileged to present the case before said committee. The findings of this co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">ittee are placed before the Minister of Justice. Whether the Government, the Minister of Justice, or our enemies the religionists, reahzed there was the possibility this committee might not recommend that Jehovah’s witnesses be declared illegal, we know not, but we do know the Minister of Justice took no chances. Immediately following the arrival of the new Governor General into this country from England, the Minister of Justice caused to be passed an order in council by the Governor General, which declared illegal the “ Jehovah’s Witness Organization”. After such declaration of illegality by the Governor in Council the following becomes effective, according to the Defence of Canada Regulations, Section 39C:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(2) Every person who after the pubheation of this regulation in the ‘Canada Gazette’ continues to be or becomes an officer or member of an illegal organization, or professes to be such, or who advocates or defends the acts, principles or policies of such illegal organization shall be guilty of an offence against this regulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(3) In any prosecution under this regulation, if it be proved that the person charged has</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(a) attended meetings of an illegal organization; or (b) spoken publicly in advocacy of an illegal organization; or</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(c) distributed literature of an illegal organization by circulation through the Post Office mails of Canada, or otherwise;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">it shall be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that he is a member of such illegal organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ (4) (a) All property, rights and interests in Canada belonging to any illegal organization shall be vested in and be subject to the control and management of the Custodian, as defined in the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(b) Subject as hereinafter provided, and for the purpose of the control and management of such prop-perty, rights and interests by the Custodian, the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939, shall apply </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="font5"> to the same extent as if such property, rights and interests belonged to an enemy within the meaning of the said Regulations;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(c) The property, rights and interests so vested in and subject to the control and management of the Custodian, or the proceeds thereof, shall on the termination of the present war be dealt with m such manner as the Governor in Council may direct. ’ ’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Publication of this order in council m the ‘ ‘ Canada Gazette ’ ’ must have sounded to the enemy like ringing of the death knell of Jehovah’s witnesses; and how they would rejoice, felicitating with one anothei at their apparent triumph against this very zealous people who were to them a plague! They had now brought about some covering from the heat which had been burning them up. Now there would be no more boils or any other plague. Now they would be happy, and no longer would their schemes be exposed to the people. Now they had m their power the means to prevent any further work being done. They would have those who claimed to be Jehovah’s witnesses arrested and thrown into piison. They would confiscate the literature, equipment, money and property. They would stop this work once and for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It reminds one very much of the experiences of the Master, that, after having served the children of Israel for several years by bringing to them the message of life, enabling them to see the way to take to avoid destruction, they valued Him and his services at no more than &quot;thirty pieces of silver”, and even stopped his work by putting him to death. So with the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada. Following years of faithful service to Jehovah, comforting the meek, warning the wicked, declaring the Father’s name, the services of Jehovah’s servant in that land are valued at no more than the passing of an order in council, stopping their work, and arresting any who attempted thereafter to show their faithfulness to Jehovah by keeping his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some have foolishly concluded that the order in council has stopped Jehovah’s work. How can this be true? Jehovah’s work is not dependent upon creatures, because His power and resources are without limitation; for as it was with the faithful witnesses in times past, such as Moses, Jeiemiah, Paul, when their oral witness had finished, then God continued his work by bringing to pass his &quot;strange act”, so that all will know that He, Jehovah alone, is Most High over all the earth. The world and all its power, and the Devil and all his hosts of wicked spirits, are powerless to stop Jehovah from performing his &quot;stiange act”, and no order in council can thwart the purpose of the Almighty. No order in council can stop the good news of God’s kingdom being declared as a witness and, while it is day time, Jehovah will see that his work is done. The footstep followers of the Lord Jesus Christ belong to no earthly organization. They are not members of any illegal organization known as &quot;Jehovah’s Witness Organization”, It is true they are Jehovah’s witnesses. It is also true they will never deny the holy name of Jehovah, but will bear it with honor and dignity and ascribe to it majesty and praise, for they were called out of darkness into hrs marvelous light to show forth his praises; and, knowing that they are covenant-bound to obey the commandments of the Most High, Jehovah’s people will obey God rather than man, and the enemy will seal their doom by reason of their opposition to Jehovah, his King and his Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of all that the religionists have done, Jehovah’s manifest blessing has been upon the witness work in Canada during the last year. It has grown by leaps and bounds, and the determination of the witnesses was to push the battle to the gate, going forth without fear, striking into the heart of the King’s enemies. The whole country, from east to west, rejoiced in their part in this great warfare. Throughout that land there are approximately eleven million persons, and the peak of publishers rose to 7,000, of which they had enrolled at the end of June nearly 700 pioneers. During the past year a great multitude of persons were comforted. The Lord’s truth was passed on to them, and they became free, and it was fully anticipated that by the end of tins year there would be eight or </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font5">e thousand publishers serving the interests of The Theocracy. It is well known that since the order in council a great number of persons have expressed their amazement and disagreement with the Government’s action, and shown their sympathies very definitely with the witnesses of Jehovah. Since the publication of the order m council there has been more publicity to Jehpvah’s witnesses than ever before. The activity, faith and convictions of these people have been made known in practically every newspaper. Of course, the vast majority of editorials and other articles have been bitter, sarcastic attacks upon the Lord’s people. Here and there some have had the courage to publish articles commending the Lord’s people for the work they have done, and expressing some surprise at the Government’s action. No doubt many more would join at least in the fight for freedom of speech, etc., were it not for the power and influence of the Catholic Hierarchy and their Catholie dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, the heap of stones has been set in the antitypical Biver Jordan. The pile of testimony is heaped up on this side of Jordan. A stene has been slung, and has entered the forehead of the giant Goliath. Even now we behold the sword of Ehud in the belly of the antitypical Eglon, and, no matter what takes place, this work cannot be undone. Jehovah will accomplish the rest, and by His grace those faithful children of the Most High still hope to have some part in Jehovah’s “strange work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is with much gratitude to Jehovah that the following is reported:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the eight months a total of 146,000 bound books were placed, an increase of more than 27,000 bound books over the corresponding year of twelve months. Their booklets were below by approximately 400,000, but they were on the eve of a great booklet campaign, and this would undoubtedly have meant that the total figure for the twelve months in booklets would have been far higher than the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord said, ‘ ‘ Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled,” and no man will remain hungry whilst food is received from the Lord. The door into the Lord’s storehouse is not closed, and the hungry will be fed and the thirsty will receive the life-giving waters of truth; for the river that flows from the throne of God continues widening and deepening, and the faithful servants of the Almighty will carry out the terms of the commission expressed in Isaiah 61, “To preach good tidings unto the meek, ... to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn. ’ ’ It can further be said, without the slightest hesitation, that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”. Bather would the witnesses of Jehovah in that land suffer persecution at the hands of the wicked than lose the favor of the Lord by not obeying his commandments. They have been taught by Jehovah to do good unto all, to hate none but those who hate Jehovah. As Jesus said, we should be ‘as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves’, and this they are endeavoring to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The increase of publishers for The Theocracy was marvelous. Whereas the monthly average for the year ending September 30, 1939, was 4,269, the average for this year was 6,081, or a monthly increase of 1,812, and the increase was stepping up each month. The totals for the month of May show that they had reached 7,000. No wonder the Devil’s crowd found the pace too hot for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ho,urs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results for eight months total over a million hours, which is an increase of over 65,000 over the corresponding period of twelve months. This in itself speaks very well for all those who served with all their might, whilst they had full opportunity. During the past year the weather was very inclement; in fact, it seemed as though the su</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">ertime would never come in. Snow, ice, rain, all these hardships interfered with the Lord’s work being done, but the difficulties were overcome and the work was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ministers of the Lord continually reminded the brethren to visit and revisit the interested, because the time might come when they would not be free to go from house to house in the way outlined at that time. The majority of companies did this, and such work now has proved to be very profitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Model studies were commenced in all districts possible, and thousands of people came to some appreciation of the truth. During the eight months there were 167,935 back-calls made. This is an increase of 65,709 over the previous twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was not quite as high as the previous year, nor were the total new subscriptions obtained as high as the previous year. However, the record is of over 160,000 magazines being placed with the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total results for all laborers in the vineyard very clearly manifest Jehovah’s blessing upon his work; such can be done independently of any person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional and Zone Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These faithful brethren labor continuously in the interests of The Theocracy, and during the time spent in the service several hundreds of thousands of miles have been traveled. They have endured much privation, and no doubt have grown weary in body time and again as they have faithfully kept their appointments in serving the brethren. Many new companies were formed in practically all zones. Without question of doubt, Jehovah knows their labor of love which they have done toward his name and people, and their reward comes from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Regular and Special Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report for the eight months shows an average number participating of 369, nearly 100 more a month than the year previous. The figures for pioneers were increasing, and commencing with June several hundred more were enrolled to commence work. No reports from the pioneers for the month of June, due to the Government’s action. The majority of these faithful brethren went through the cold winter season, journeying through the snows by sleigh, horse and buggy, or even walking, traveling hundreds of miles, so that those who were hungry for the truth might be fed. Jehovah’s loving-kindness was with them, and they lejoiced greatly in their privilege of serving The Theocracy, and those people who now find refuge under its wings. They know that they serve Jehovah, The Theo-crat, and no one can shake them in their faith. They will continue to magnify the name of Jehovah as long as they have breath in their bodies. These brethren will now realize more than ever before what it means to have the peace of God, which passeth human understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much preparation was given to each period, so that there would be fullness of expression on the part of the brethren in their service to The Theocrat. It was noticed that the results which were obtained were by overcoming many obstacles, indifference, and opposition on the part of the “goats”. However, the Devil’s ranks were continually broken into, and many persons of good-will assisted in the way of truth, and we know they found salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Detroit Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When first it was learned there was to be a great convention of the Lord’s people in Columbus, thousands of Canadian brethren purposed attending, and preparation was going forward to this end. The moving of the convention from Columbus to Detroit was not the means of preventing the brethren from going over the line. Neither was the restriction which was placed on the amount of money which Canadian visitors were permitted to take into the States. This was a serious handicap, but, in addition, the Devil saw to it that other means were introduced to stop journeying to the convention. On July 1, it became necessary to possess a passport to get into the United States, and, owing to the fact that thousands of persons in Canada wished to go into the States, it was impossible for the Government to cope with the situation and attend to all the applications. There was the further difficulty created by the passing of the order in council, making the “Jehovah’s Witness Organization” illegal. Some, however, were able to visit their friends in the United States, and attend the convention, and they brought back full reports. Now they have the further ‘ ‘ messengers ’ ’ explaining matters in detail, and it is hoped that all brethren in Canada will hear of the experiences of Jehovah’s people at that great assembly. Every one of them looks forward to the greater convention to be held after Armageddon. That will be a gathering without limitation, hindrance, or border restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Present Situation in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is difficult to put into writing the full situation. The Government has the power to censor all mail, and even withhold it, as they have done in the case of much mail and the field service reports for June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s children are taught of him, and great is their peace. Said one of Jehovah’s witnesses, “Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing shall offend them.” Jehovah is their Rock and their salvation, and in him they put their trust. They are confident that he will keep them in perfect peace, as their minds are stayed upon him, because they do put their trust in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Naturally, the order in council has broken into their line of communication, malting it practically impossible for brethren to write to one another, much less for the Society to send forth its </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informants,</span><span class="font5"> special letters, organization instructions, etc., as heretofore. When the final record is written up, it will be seen that Jehovah’s servants have continued to labor long and hard m the interests of their brethren whom they love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some districts where there was opposition to the work, the authorities took hold of the first opportunity to make arrests, search the homes, seize the literature. Then they had the brethren sentenced to as much as six months’ imprisonment, and in some cases threatened internment following the imprisonment if they would not repudiate their membeiship in &quot;Jehovah’s Witness Organization”. First-class counsel has been used m the Province of Ontario to help the brethren with eases. Tins has been done at much financial expense, but the work of fighting the cases legally has done good. The fact that some sentences have been light as a result of the fighting has only been incidental to the main issue involved. Legal counsel has also been engaged on behalf of the brethren m the Maritime Provinces and m the Western Provinces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Flag Saluting</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the children of the witnesses of Jehovah have taken their stand in the schools against the compulsory measures introduced for flag saluting, and the singing or the national anthem This has given many religionists and others the opportunity of getting at Jehovah’s witnesses, using the old tactics of labeling them as being ‘ ‘ subversive ”, ‘ ‘ unpatriotic, ” “ antiBritish, ” etc. However, remember that the Lord Jesus, whom they profess to worship, was called &quot;a winebibber”, &quot;pnnee of devils,” &quot;a seditiomst,” and finally placed in position between two thieves. The authorities claim they are finding it difficult to understand the attitude of these children, and fail to realize that the children are taking their own stand. They ignorantly conclude that children of eight or twelve years of age could not come to their own decision re refusal to salute the flag, but have been instructed by their parents to take this course. The witnesses of Jehovah know that such childien have been taught the Scriptures, have learned the commandments of the Almighty, and obeyed them. The police authorities are charging the parents of the children with the crime of &quot;continuing to be members of an illegal organization”, or &quot;unlawfully did advocate or defend the fact, principles, etc., of an illegal organization”, purely on the grounds that the children obey the commands of the Lord. They are even going a step further, by taking action against the parents of the children under the Defence of Canada Regulations, charging that &quot;unlawfully (they) did make certain statements to their children, to wit: ‘Do not sing &quot;God Save the King”; do not salute the flag,’ or statements of a like effect, which statements were intended or likely to cause disaffection to His Majesty contrary to Regulation 39”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two brethren were found guilty under these Regulations, and now the local authorities are awaiting word from Ottawa as to whether they are to be interned. All this persecution because the children seek to faithfully obey the commandments of the Almighty God. It is certainly true that ‘out of the mouths of babes and sucklings He has ordained praise’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For years they knew these times would come. This is the day which the Lord has made, and we will rejoice and be glad in it; though those of this world count us not worthy to be associated with them, yet our citizenship is in heaven, and we look to the City which has foundations, The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As these trials are endured the opportunity is provided for exalting the name of the Most High, with honor. The Theocracy is here, the Theocratic King, Christ Jesus, is on His throne, and the forces of earth are being maneuvered into position for the final battle at Armageddon. They are in the thick of the fight, and rejoice to be there. The onslaught made against Jehovah’s witnesses in that land cannot have come for anything else than faithfulness to the King, and the intensity of the battle m that land has so penetrated the ranks of the enemy that they have taken action against the witnesses of Jehovah. These things no doubt have been a trial and a test to some, and given opportunity for criticism; but know this: that those who look to the Theoerat and to the Theocratic arrangements will be at peace, and will pray the prayer as recorded in Psalm 118: “God is the Lord, which hath shewed us light; bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. Thou art my God, and I will praise thee; thou art my God, I will exalt thee. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.”—Vss. 27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finally, with humility and reveience toward Jehovah the Creator, they declare that His Name will ever be upon their bps and never denied. They exclaim with the psalmist, “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. ’ ’—Ps. 137: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They will continue to rejoice in Jehovah our Savior.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>CENTRAL EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For a number of years the Society’s Central European office maintained at Berne, Switzerland, has conducted the witness work in more than a dozen other countries. Practically all of these are now under the absolute control of the totalitarians, and it is impossible for any communication to be carried on between such countries and the Brooklyn office. While Switzerland still remains nominally a republic, it is in fact now dominated by arbitrary power. Surrounded on every hand by the totalitarians, the Swiss government is forced by reason of fear to be submissive to the totalitarians. At the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and totalitarian combine the Bethel Home at Berne was swooped down upon by officials, all the literature seized, and most of the family driven away, only a few left in charge to look after the property. Since then it has been impossible to receive direct communication from Switzerland, and impossible to get a report setting forth the amount of work done. We know, however, that a large amount of literature has been placed in these countries, for the reason that a goodly stock was on hand in places where it can be used, and the zeal of the brethren there is such that as long as they can move about they will certainly put the message in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this writing we have no report to make from the Central European office, and, should information be received later, it will be published in some other publication for the benefit of those who may desire to read it. All the brethren may be assured, however, that the consecrated people of the Lord throughout these war - racked, totalitarian - ruled countries are doing everything within their power to give testimony to the Kingdom and, without a question of doubt, they are doing what the Lord would have them do. The day of reckoning manifestly is near at hand; and when the time fully arrives that they can do no more, that is strong evidence that the “strange work” in that part of the earth is done and the next is the “strange act”. Let the people of God throughout the earth, therefore, give thanks to Jehovah and his King that they and their brethren have had some part thus far in advertising The Theocracy, that the people of good-will may have an opportunity to find refuge and relief. In the totalitarian, Hierarchy-ruled countries everyone now devoted to the Lord must look to the Lord entirely. If he is isolated and must go alone, he always has the Lord with him. While all seems dark to the people of the world, those devoted to Jehovah and his King are not in the darkness. Their hearts are fixed on The Theocracy, they know that the Kingdom is here, and with patience they wait for the manifestation of Jehovah’s power through Christ Jesus, that they may receive full deliverance and enter into everlasting joy. Let all of such, therefore, be of good courage and press on with unabated zeal for The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This much of a report got through from one of these isolated countries, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We receive no mail of any consequence. The Lord’s devoted people, however, continue their work amongst great persecution. They do not slack their hands. Almost all pioneers have been repeatedly arrested and their literature seized, but, since they carry only small amounts of literature with them, not much fell into the hands of the enemy. At a recent convention 150 of the brethren attended. Many could not come because they are very poor. There were some from all parts of this small country, and we received a great blessing. The “Fifth Column Exposure” has been printed in two languages in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Germany, Yugoslavia, Austria, and other countries the brethren push on with the work to the best of their ability. Not being able to receive </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> when one is received they mimeograph the articles and distribute them amongst those who love the Lord. The Lord will take care of his own. The Lord will avenge his own, and that quickly. All praise to Jehovah and his King!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three years ago the president of the Society in a public address at Berne, Switzerland, told the people that Switzerland would be overrun by the Fascists and that no longer would that nation be a democracy. The next day the police were looking for the speaker. The result was, an order was made that no more public addresses should be delivered in Switzerland without the police first issuing a permit after examining the manuscript. Today the Nazis and Fascists have put so much fear into the minds of the Swiss officials that all mail addressed to the president of this Society is censored, and often it is confiscated. But the hand of the Lord is not shortened. He saw to it that a report reached this office just before going to press with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> That report will be read with great interest by the Lord’s people generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses and companies in America have suffered many indignities during the year, but nothing to compare with what indignities have been heaped upon the Lord’s people in Europe. Recently the Society’s servants at Berne have been arrested and summoned before the courts. Honorable Johannes Huber, member of the House of Representatives, of the republic, has taken an interest in the matter to defend our brethren. He writes: “The proceedings of the Military Tribunal against you and against your Association are incomprehensible to me. Either one does not know aim and substance of your Association or a certain influence is forcing its way through that is not impartial and is serving interests for protection of which the justice in general should not be at disposal, and especially not the military justice.”</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font5">(*These totals refer to the shipment of all copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> in all languages mailed out to subscribers or publishers for redistribution.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the evermore increasing difficulties, connection with the various branch offices under the jurisdiction of the Central European Office has become very difficult, if not entirely impossible. For this reason a comparison of the results of the past fiscal year with those of 1938-39 cannot convey a true picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Proper monthly reports for each of the twelve months are to hand only for two countries, i.e., Switzerland and Yugoslavia. As regards the other branch offices, the reports cover but part of their activity. Figures are altogether lacking from Poland, where during the former fiscal year there were 41 pioneers and 998 company publishers. There are now no pioneers in Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of all this, the results obtained in Central Europe during the past year may be said to be wonderful. The number of books distributed is even higher, which seems to be due chiefly to the zealous activity in Switzerland and Holland. If few figures are available for most countries, that does not mean that the pubhshers there have ceased their activity. On the contrary, one learns from time to time that the voice of the faithful witnesses of God is still heard everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here now a comparison of the results of the two last years:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total 1940 Total 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103,591 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88,960</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;929,926 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,728,426</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total literature &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,033,517 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,817,386</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This result was reached by 3,369 publishers, in 396,342 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further, there were obtained 3,309 new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions, and 314,879 copies of periodicals distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The back-call work has increased tremendously; for we are able to report for the past fiscal year for the few yet reporting countries 44,642 calls, while during the former year with the full number of branch offices reporting there were 47,620 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unfortunately we are hardly able this year to indicate the number of organized companies, for we have data available only for Switzerland and partly for Yugoslavia and Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We see that during the fiscal year 1939-40 more books have been manufactured than in the previous year. On the other hand, manufacture of booklets, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">copies is far behind the production of former years, this, of course, on account of the extraordinary conditions now prevailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to printed matter we manufactured 140 portable phonographs, whereof 40 were of the usual model, while the other 100 were constructed according to our own design, the case being made of fine varnished and polished wood, instead of metal This model is much more popular than the small adjustable model. One hundred more phonographs of this new construction are in preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few remarks yet about our manufacture of literature. By decree of the Press Commission of the Swiss Army Staff, dated June 29, 1940, all pubheations to be issued by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society are subject to preliminary censorship for an indefinite period. In our appeal of July 4 we stated that we had decided to discontinue the printing as from the 1st of July, 1940, of all literature, with the exception of the magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> Thus since that time only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> in German has been printed in our factory. The production report for the fiscal year 1939-40 therefore comprises but ten months as regards books, booklets and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This incisive measure on the part of the military authorities is the chief reason why our production during the fiscal year just terminated has not surpassed that of all the preceding years. There are yet other reasons also: The beginning of the fiscal year coincided with the outbreak of war in Europe. Shortly after the work was suppressed in Erance, so that this country fell off, which, of course, meant a considerable loss for us. Then for a long time we were not able to supply anything to Einland on account of the war in that country. After peace was restored, 8,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> (instead of the 20,000 ordered) could be shipped to Finland via Sweden. For a time there was no possibility of transport at all to the Nordic and Baltic States; also freight rates were in many instances prohibitive. These circumstances had, of course, a paralyzing effect upon our production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then followed in spring the invasion of Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg by the Germans, so that no literature can be sent for the time being to these countries. Were it not for the measures taken against us by the Swiss military authorities, we would even today still have an opportunity of printing for Northern Europe and Switzerland. Orders are to hand and we would have enough work. We may further mention that since the beginning of the past fiscal year, Holland has printed booklets and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on the machines received from Prague. However, the war, i.e., German measures, have made it impossible, there too, to use their own plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The family has been reduced by half, and the remaining 31 brothers and sisters are more closely united than ever. The trials which have come upon us during the year have not discouraged us, but rather strengthened our glorious hope that soon the “strange act’’ of Jehovah will begin, and that he will ‘smite the Assyrian because he has stretched forth his hand toward the daughter of Zion’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we because of the trouble we experienced, and whereof we have already written you, found it necessary to reduce operations and do without the services of a number of our coworkers, many with tears in their eyes expressed their regret to be leaving us, and their joyful readiness to return for further service at Bethel when at any time we should need them. They also stated that the time spent in the Bethel home was the happiest in their lives. Those privileged to remain gladly agreed to the measures of economy taken, such as reduction of the allowance and a more modest table. We have at present a hard battle to fight against the ‘wicked powers of darkness’, but we place our complete confidence in the Lord, who in His own good time will deliver us from the lions’ den into which the enemy has brought us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year again the brethren of the Bethel family have zealously participated in the service from house to house. Monthly maximum of publishers, 48; average, 39. In 6,538 hours they spread: 2,307 books, 12,236 booklets, 6,549 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> 2,252 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and 11 Bibles. 168 new subscriptions were gained. For 36 phonographs in use we are able to report 2,952 lectures, 6,504 sound attendance, 3,135 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the number of publishers has receded somewhat in the course of the year on account of conditions, more books were placed than during the preceding year. We must add that some brethren who had always good success in the field have now been in the pioneer service for three months, while others work on the farms and hand in their reports there. Many brothers are sent out to the companies during week-ends. We have also to take into account that since the war the foreign brethren may work but little, if at all, from house to house; they concentrate more on back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The back-call work shows a gratifying increase in that during the past year 60 percent more back-calls were made than during 1938-39.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">No report has been received since April of this year, when this country was invaded by the Germans. Also all communication with the brethren there has been entirely cut off from that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From letters and reports received before April we see that the brethren and Jonadabs in Belgium showed great zeal and developed exceptional activity. This is clearly shown by a comparison of the results of the last two years:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The comparison shows that during the first seven months of the fiscal year 1939, distribution was only about 130,000 books and booklets, while during the same time of the year just passed 170,000 copies were spread. The same may be said as regards the hours, i.e., 50,113, to compare with 62,404 for the whole of the previous year. During the first seven months of the past year there were even more back-calls made, viz., 2,569, than during the twelve months of the previous year (2,406).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From a letter written by a faithful pioneer from Switzerland, which after long weeks and months reached his mother, we could only gather that as far as he knew none of the faithful of the Lord in Belgium suffered any harm during the stormy days, and that the Lord is providing for all necessities of His people there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The only report received from the pioneers in this country is for September, 1939. As regards the companies, we have also had but one report, and that for March tins year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the fiscal year the brethren in Bohemia and Moravia could, to some extent, work unhindered from house to house in carrying the message of the Kingdom to the people of good-will. They reported regularly the number of publishers and literature distributed; the total monthly figures were sent to the Berne office. This correspondence, however, was duly controlled by the Gestapo, and in the last report, received in June, particulars regarding the numbers of publishers and literature placed were carefully cut out. Since tins time we have received no further statement, and it is evident that a sharp control is being exercised on the part of the German secret police. We are not informed whether a number of the brethren have been arrested, and all further intercourse by letter has been completely cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Slovakia the conditions were always more difficult, and from this part of the country we have still less news. The brother who was commissioned to represent the Society there was arrested because of his refusal to do military service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Individual companies wrote us of their activity in the house-to-house work. We kept the brethren posted with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> from the Berne office, but in a number of cases these were confiscated by the Gestapo. Several brethren, however, reported with great delight that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> had arrived, and expressed their appreciation of the spiritual food provided by Jehovah for his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren will, without doubt, continue in their endeavors to do all that remains possible under the existing difficult conditions to make known Jehovah’s name and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>DANZIG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Danzig has lost its privilege as a &quot;Free City”—if it ever could be considered as such—when Poland was divided up. The only report that has reached us is for September, 1939, and mentions 5 books and 23 booklets distributed. Since that time we have had no connection whatever with the brethren there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Middle of October, 1939, that is to say, soon after the outbreak of hostilities, difficulties began for the Society in Paris, in that on October 18 the literature was confiscated and the office closed. Shortly before this action by the arm of the State, the branch servant, Brother Knecht, who for years had faitn-fully performed his service, became sick, and died soon after. Thereupon a brother was sent from Switzerland to Paris in order to look after the interests of the Society there, and see if in any way possible the company organization could be maintained. Late spring this brother returned to Berne and compiled a report from which we take the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;For more than four months we have not ceased pressing for the appointment of a judicial liquidator according to the decree. Time and again we were promised that such an appointment would soon take place. It was not possible to find out the reason for the delay on the part of the Court, in spite of renewed appeals by the American Embassy and our lawyer. . . . Notwithstanding the difficulties encountered when giving the witness, and in spite of the war, the brethren are very courageous and do with their might what their hands find to do. Books and booklets are also still placed in the hands of the people. When calling with the Bible, they give a bold witness of the Kingdom, and where there is interest they fix back-calls and tnereby distribute literature. This method also allows the phonograph work to go on. As was to be expected, many brethren, especially in Northern France, and also in the Alsace, have already been put in prison. In the course of the year quite a number have been immersed. All these Jonadab brethren show quite a special zeal and much love for the Kingdom. Dp till now the brethren in France have received regularly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and with each new edition one hears them say: ‘This is the best yet.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;The British and Foreign Bible Society surely never had such a big sale of Bibles and New Testaments as since the beginning of hostilities. The companies were instructed to get their Bibles and Testaments from this Bible Society in Paris. Upon this increased demand for Bibles, the Bible Society caused placards to be pasted up reading as follows: ‘The prophecies of the Bible are being fulfilled,’ and, ‘The Bible is the source of all true riches.’ But also publications explaining the Bible are still available in considerable quantities aS already intimated. And so we see the Lord has made rich provisions for His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I am thus pleased to report that the French brethren in these last days, in spite of the war and the strong opposition of the enemy, courageously do their best to share in the vindication of the name of Jehovah, and to thereby prove their integrity. They wish me to convey to all who fight for The Theocracy and the name of Jehovah many loving greetings and best wishes.—Ch. Z. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the time France was subdued by the Germans we have lost all connection with the brethren in Paris and of the occupied territory generally. Not a single letter or card, nor any other sign has reached us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As regards the unoccupied French territory, we exchange more or less regular correspondence with the brother who formerly represented the Society in Alsace. He too reports that he has no news whatever of the brethren who previously worked in Pans and lived in the house in Enghien.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also entirely impossible for Swiss brethren to obtain a visa either for the occupied or for the unoccupied French territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We give below the figures, which, of course, do not bear any comparison with any of the former reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 9,215 hours 348 publishers distributed 1,381 books, 22,917 booklets, 4,527 magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further, there were used 7 sound-ears, 4 PTM’s and 170 phonographs. 3,954 people heard the recorded message, and the brethren were able to make 785 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are, however, convinced that the results actually obtained in this country, in spite of the difficulties, are greater than those reported above. We have received but meager reports, owing to the now partially functioning postal traffic between France and Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is now quite manifest that France is entirely in the hands of the Hierarchy. Shortly after the outbreak of the war in September, 1939, the editor of a humanistic Paris paper stated to a representative of our Society: “Now already there are a number of prominent statesmen who see with apprehension that the Hierarchy in France has even now grasped all the powers of government, and that any resistance against this influence is impossible.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Since Germany has started on its “uninterrupted triumphal march of conquest”, there is not even a slight organic connection with the brethren in Germany and former Austria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reports regarding crimes committed by National Socialist Germany against true Christians during the past year continued to reach us until last spring. Germany has surely received more evidence than any other country under the sun that Jehovah can have people on earth who under the greatest stress maintain their faithfulness to Him. Indeed, as the apostle Paul 1900 years ago said, nothing can separate the faithful ones from the love of God, ‘neither tribulation, nor distress, nor persecution, nor famine, nor nakedness, nor peril, nor sword. As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in Edi these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.’ (Bomans 8: 35-37) Cases of persecution and faithfulness even unto death in the meaning of the aforementioned words of the apostle Paul are given below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Salzburg, former Austria, eight witnesses of Jehovah were brought before the Military Court because they declined to do war service for reasons of faith and conscience. Two of them were sentenced to death and executed. The others were taken to Berlin and, as reported by someone, also sentenced to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the trial in Salzburg the judge and his associates attempted to make the accused change their minds. Eventually they caused their wives to appear in the courtroom in the hope that their appearance would influence these men to yield, but, on the contrary, these faithful women, strong in faith, spoke words of encouragement to them before all, saying: “Your lives are in the hand of God.” This made such a deep impression that the judge sprang to his feet in great agitation, hammered the table with his fist, and said: “These people are not criminals or traitors, but rather a company of believers whose number is not limited to two or three but goes into hundreds and even thousands.” The law demanded the death sen tenee!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the day preceding the execution the two men were visited in their cell and a fresh attempt was made to make them waver. Being asked if they had one last wish, they expressed the desire to have a Bible, which was brought to them by the judge personally. He observed them till midnight in their cell, and then went away remarking: “Both of these men in their last hour were united with their God; they are indeed holy men! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They both declared it unnecessary to bandage their eyes, but it was done nevertheless. According to the report received the soldiers commanded to execute them showed hesitation in carrying out the order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even Catholic clergymen of that town commended the steadfastness of Jehovah’s witnesses to their parishioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two coffins were released for private burial. Approximately 300 people attended, under strict police surveillance, of course. A patrol and many Gestapo officials were present. These were asked to allow three songs to be sung and a prayer to be uttered; the singing was refused, and the prayer eventually interrupted by the harsh words of a Gestapo official—a special enemy of Jehovah’s witnesses—because he considered it too long. The Gestapo had also especially forbidden the use of the name “Jehovah”, which, however, did not hinder one brother calling out as the coffin was lowered: “Till we meet again in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s</span><span class="font5"> Kingdom!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was also reported that a 22-year-old witness of Jehovah was shot in the military prison of Germersheim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among others 25 of Jehovah’s witnesses were taken at the beginning of the year from Vienna to Berlin in order to be tried and sentenced by the military court. In several other cases the sentence was hard labor for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also at the beginning of this year a witness of Jehovah, by the name of Alram, was delivered to prison in Vienna because he had refused the oath of allegiance to Hitler in the auxiliary police service. Shortly thereafter his wife was informed that her husband had died, and that she could get his clothes and ring. Any further information was refused. Alram was, no doubt, tortured to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A retired police inspector from Linz, Tyrol, by the name of Lengauer, as a witness of Jehovah also refused service in Hitler’s army for reasons of faith and conscience. He was taken to Berlin, suspected and accused of deserting the flag, and on November 16, 1939, sentenced to death by beheading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Extract from a letter from a husband to his wife:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ My dear... I have a few hard days behind me, but now things are a little easier for me. . . . Do not shed so many tears; be calm and strong. ... I couldn’t act otherwise—I must obey God rather than men. It was a hard test even unto death, trembling the hand, weak the voice, but God does not abandon us. Men think they can separate us for ever; but be of good courage, Jehovah will turn our captivity in his fixed time and wipe away all tears. ...” This witness of Jehovah was sentenced to hard labor for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A little later we received news from Austria that a further eight faithful witnesses of Jehovah had been transported to Berlin, where some were executed at end of 1939, and the others at beg</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">innin</span><span class="font5">g of 1940. The names of these brothers were published at the time in the German issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> They all died as witnesses for Jehovah God. As documents of Christian steadfastness, we give below extracts from two farewell letters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Berlin, the... My dear wife, I send you the last greetings from afar. My sentence will be executed; but be comforted, for we will meet again. I am well and of good courage. Dear wife, the household and all there is belongs to you. You may keep all as your property. Have we not worked and saved and prospered together? My dear, be strong, and try to regain health and strength, and may all things go well with you so long as you live. Eor with me it is now the last—I have finished the fight. I go to rest until the Lord calls me and then we shall have a better life together than now; then we shall meet again. . . . The time we are separated will be short. ... Be of good cheer and render thanks unto God. . . . Last greetings from your faithful husband. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From a second letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Berlin, the... Pear... Now I have one last opportunity to write you a letter. I was informed this evening that the sentence will be executed tomorrow morning at </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5</span><span class="font5"> o’clock. When you receive this letter I shall be dead. Po not sorrow about my death, for it is the will of the Creator that I lose my life. . . . I have fought through hard, stormy days, but the Lord has led me step by step. ... You know why I give my life. . . . I have held fast to that which the Lord has given me. It is my desire that the name of the Most High be soon vindicated and that the evil one with his crowd come to an end. . . . May the Lord be with you. Heartfelt greetings to you and your family in the Lord. Looking forward to the joy of meeting again in the Lord. Yours ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a letter addressed to the editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> (German; it was reported: “We learn that a witness of Jehovah was ill-treated at various times by receiving 25 times 25 strokes; and why! Only because he had encouraged his brethren in the faith by Bible texts to faithful perseverance. . . . This terrible treatment which was applied to him on account of his conviction and steadfastness caused him to become a physical wreck. He can’t walk normally any more, and is not able to hold his body upright.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further: A strange quarry that is being exploited near Linz, Austria! It seems that twelve months of work suffice to make a corpse out of the healthiest man. At least this time was sufficient to bring to death a faithful servant of the Society in Vienna, and a brother from the Brunn company. Both of them had faithfully served their God for years, one having been a faithful witness of the Most High for more than 25 years. Because of their Christian conviction they were banned by the Nazis to hard labor in that quarry, under the supervision of the usual Concentration Camp guards. Both of them, witnesses of Jehovah, although having enjoyed good health, died after so short a time <sup>1 1</sup> from heart weakness ’ ’, as was reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This reminds one of what is said on page 34 of the British White Paper concerning the treatment of German nationals in Germany: “The physical maltreatment normally experienced by prisoners sometimes led to apoplexy and death. Cause of death would then be stated by the doctor as ‘weak heart’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely these two men who finished their lives in the hands of pitiless enemies had their thoughts stayed on God’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom to the last breath. Their hearts—the heart that counts before God—were not weakened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is a good thing that the heart be established with grace. . . . For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come [The Theocracy].”—Hebrews 13:9,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A letter received from a town in southern Germany read as follows: “We are some young folks here, grown-up children of Jehovah’s witnesses, 16 to 20 years of age, and we mutually exhort one another to love not our lives unto death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Biblical literature is circulating from hand to hand, and they take great pains to copy it by hand even as was done before the invention of the printing art. The Gestapo is not unaware of this. We mention this in order to show how precious to these people is the instruction of God’s Word which they seek, although in so doing they risk their liberty and their lives. It is the source of their strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And so we could go on telling of such experiences. Several cases of genuine kidnaping of children by the Gestapo were also reported. Germany, which brags of being a cultured nation of leading rank, shows today its beastly grimace to the world: a country the fuehrers of which are dominated by the demons and whose fate will be fully realized in Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No figures have been sent to us from Germany, but there is no doubt that none of the true witnesses of the Lord were dumb or inactive. Thus the time is nearing when Jehovah will ‘confirm the word of his servant’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As regards the activity in this country, we have but some figures. The branch servant in Belgrade was instructed to see to it that the report proper on Hungary be sent with his own report direct to the Brooklyn Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What we have been able to glean from the communications received from time to time, the enemy, especially the Hierarchy, has pressed the faithful in Hungary very hard during the whole year. The publishers had to move with greatest caution in the witness work. Quite a number of brethren are in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The figures reported comprise only three months’ work as regards the pioneers, and eleven months for the company publishers. It seems that an organized activity from house to house was hardly possible any more; for although there were 158 more publishers than last year, viz., 399, the number of books distributed was but little more, while there were 10,000 booklets less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, the number of back-calls and of hours is so high that they do not bear any comparison to the previous year. In any ease the present report shows that the publishers in Hungary are making the best use possible of the opportunities yet remaining.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the course of the previous fiscal year, and also before, we had received many, many letters from Italy asking us to send them more literature, more spiritual food. We did our best, but could not send more than a book or a few booklets at a time to any one address. When we tried to send but a little more the packages were either returned to us or confiscated at the border. For this reason we had been considering ways and means of getting some more literature into the country in another way. At end of August, 1939, a few days before the war broke out, we were able to get some 3,000 books and booklets down to Italy for distribution to the brethren and Jonadabs, so that they might pass it on to interested people. The brethren in Italy were then informed that they could get some books, and orders were freely coming in when about middle of October the sister having to do with the literature became aware that the police were interested in her. However, she did not expect any serious measures. On November 1 she was arrested. The police searched her flat and by this action must have found the addresses of the other Italian brethren, for most of these, about 150, were arrested in the course of November, 1939. Some of them were released after two or three months, while the others were taken to Borne to appear before the Special Fascist Tribunal. Sr. Cummetti, the widow of the late brother in charge, has got a sentence of nine years. We are informed that she is well, however. No reliable news could be obtained as to the sentence pronounced upon Sr. Maria Pizzatti, of Milan, who is evidently considered the most responsible for the “crime” of spreading the literature. (This sister was introduced to you, Brother Butherford, on the occasion of the Paris convention in 1937.) We fear that she received a very hard sentence, banishment to some Italian penal island or something similar. Dear old Bro. Marcello Martinelli of Castione-Andevenno has been banished to the island of Sardinia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now follow some extracts from letters received from Italy: “May the grace and the strength of the Lord abound with his people in these perilous days. As you know, the few Christians here were nearly all imprisoned in November. After two months some were released while the others were kept in prison. The sister from Milan was arrested on November 1 and imprisoned in Milan. A few days later she was joined there by Sr. Cuminetti of Turin and, on the 18th of November, by two more sisters. The latter were released on January 25, 1940, while the former two will probably be taken to Borne to the Special Tribunal, where there will also no doubt be others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jan. 26, 1940. I answer with some delay your two letters end of October and December. The writer is the wife and sister m the Lord of ... I can inform you that in our region there are many ‘islands’, but that these are at some distance from each other. On October 29 my husband went to some place in order to renew our subsciiption for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> On that very day the enemies of the Kingdom arrested him, and the following day two State officials came to me, searched the whole house and took away all the spiritual food I had. On the same day when my husband was arrested they also arrested two other brothers and two sisters. Shortly after I learned that Luke 21:12 had a special fulfillment in our province, for all the brethren were arrested. During the first two months I got news from my husband about his personal well-being, but am now without news for a month. And now, dear brethren in the Lord, I would ask of you the favor to send me some food for my mind, for since October I have not had anything, and I fervently wish to get something again in order to draw strength and comfort therefrom, for from near and far 1 am the only one still enjoying my freedom. In the spirit, however, 1 am united with the Lord. . . . Please answer very soon and let me hear something from you, by the grace of the Lord our King. Please remember me in your prayers, and all those who are in prison. 1 assure you that I do the same for all my brethren m the Lord.—E. T. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Similar communications were received from all Italian provinces where there are brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Feb. 12, 1940. Herewith I answer your letter of January 4. 1 have read it with great joy. After three months’ imprisonment I am home again, but only conditionally. Now will you kindly give me some instructions as to how 1 should act, the whole company from here being in prison, and 1 alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Sister A. and ten brothers were taken to Home. My uncle and five or six other brothers have each been sentenced to five years in a concentration camp; my father is there since July, 1939, already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I shall gladly receive from you or other brethren instructions, as 1 am entirely alone as already mentioned, and there is nobody to encourage me, as Jesus said we should encourage one another. I pray to the Lord, not only for myself, but for all his servants everywhere, that we might be found worthy to live under The Theocracy administered by Jesus Christ our King. Then no enemy will disturb us any more. However, we are not afraid of dangers and sufferings; for we shall be victorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We have learned that the sister from Milan is also in Rome; perhaps she is together with another sister. We had ordered a number of booklets from her; some of them we received. . . . The police have searched our house and confiscated all our literature. ... If you could send me something, 1 would be very grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I have understood everything you said about immersion and the explanations given in the books. However, these having been taken from me, I cannot read them any more. As regards discs we will wait; 1 would so much like to hear them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In closing I wish you always the Lord’s peace. All the brethren in prison greet you cordially, also the writer. Your friend and servant.—E.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“March 3, 1940. I answer your letters of end of January and February. I thank you for your news, which I have read with great pleasure. My answer is delayed because I wanted to thank you for the tea which you forwarded to me. Unfortunately, I have not received it as yet. If I do not get it, I trust the Lord will keep me warm just the same, as also all those who suffer from the intense cold that prevails in the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“My husband has been taken to Eome, together with all his companions, in order to answer their accusers. So far I have not heard anything about the trial. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“March 14, 1940. Things seem to move very slowly in Borne. My sister was taken there on January 31 to be tried and sentenced. Since then we have not heard anything further. She does not wish to correspond with us directly, probably so as to leave us out of the affair. She only writes to a sister-in-law and a cousin who happened to be on visit with her the day she was arrested. Four officials came to search the apartment, and to see if there was any literature from Milan. They found nothing, however, but took along all the correspondence. After a few hours’ search in the house, the sister was fetched from her working place. She was questioned thoroughly, and then escorted away, t</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hinkin</span><span class="font5">g she would come home again, but the two relatives did not see her any more. The arrest occurred on November 6, 1939. . . . Becently she wrote that she was quite well in Eome, being together with two other sisters, and that they were always of good courage.—M. and A. B. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As mentioned at the beginning of this report on Italy, we have since learned that Sr. Cuminetti referred to in the above letter got a sentence of nine years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“March 25, 1940. I have your kind words and thank you for your interest. Two months of great cold were surely hard to bear [in the prison of Milan], but the Lord gave us strength to stand it, and my health has not suffered. I was treated like all the others, bread and water, and once a day some soup. I was not maltreated, but followed by policemen every step I made. After two or three months some were released conditionally, and some retained for the Special Tribunal. A few weeks ago I had to appear before the Commission, and am now placed under some </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font5">d of special supervision which will cease after two years if I ‘behave properly’. I am prohibited to correspond with any ‘suspected people’, with any ‘religious sect’, under threat of new imprisonment. This clearly shows that they want to dissolve the organization of Jw, which they claim to be a dangerous sect and the work of which they consider ‘high treason’, carried out to undermine the basis of the state and religion. For 52 days I was in the company of Maria Pizzatti and Sr. Albina Cuminetti. Sr. P. is very strong and courageous; her pleasant demeanor was a help to me; and the Lord did not fail to show his love and care for us. I hope that he will sustain her until the end. Now they are in Eome where conditions are better than in Milan. However, if her incarceration should be a prolonged one, how can she stand it with her delicate health? May the Lord’s blessing be upon all those who love </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5">. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ March 27, 1940. 1 answer your card of March 15 and thank you for your news. I was very glad to get the little package of tea, and appreciate it very much, for the previous one did not reach me. Thanks to the Lord, one of our sisters and myself could celebrate the Memorial on the evening of March 23. My husband is still in Rome. We do not know when they will be released out of these troubles. I ask you to also pray for all those who suffer, so that the Lord might lighten our difficulties. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘April 2, 1940. With some delay I answer your letter of March 14. I was very glad to hear that you also pray to God for those in prison. We also call upon our great God Jehovah to give us a greater measure of wisdom and understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘I delayed my answer somewhat because I expected a letter from my sister A. as well as from other brethren, and hoped to give you more detailed news. My sister informed me that she was questioned twice, namely, on February 9 and 29. However, I do not know what the questions were. I only know that she was questioned by a judge of the Special Tribunal in Rome. She does not mention anything about the other brethren, and we have no news of them. As soon as I hear something I shall let you know. I know that in Rome my sister made the acquaintance of the sister from Milan, also of the widow of Bro. Cuminetti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘As regards myself, I may state that the time I was in prison passed well, and that I am grateful to our heavenly Father. I was together with my sister and another sister, and we were calm and confident. I shall continue to put my trust in the Lord, and I do not fear either men or devil. Jehovah and Christ alone I fear, for they alone are able to give me life, they alone have this power. And now, my dear friends, would you kindly send me some tea. . . . P.S. The name of the other sister who shared our prison cell is Maria Martino; she has been sentenced to five years’ banishment; she is now in Vendoteno (province of Littoria).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘April 10, 1940. I thank you very much for the excellent tea of the past month. We would be very glad if you could further provide us with the necessary spiritual food. We fervently hope that we will continue to get it, because Jehovah wills it, and because of the grace of our present King.—Ps. 145: 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘Now as to the time that ‘evil woman’ (Rev. 17) kept me in prison with all the other brothers and sisters, I can only say that some were persecuted. They also mocked at the name of Jehovah, saying: ‘Who is that God?’ But none of the brethren allowed themselves to be intimidated by the ‘giant’. (1 Sam. 17) As regards the brethren taken to Rome, I have tried to get some news about them from their relatives. However, these do not know anything yet as to the outcome of the trial, and the brethren continue to be detained. As regards the sister from Milan, I was not able to learn anything. If you can continue to let us have some of your excellent tea, kindly send it to the address below.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘May 19, 1940. Last winter you asked me if I could give you any news about our dear Bro. Martinelli who had done so much work in our region. I have not been able to learn anything except that he fought a very good fight, and that he is still in banishment on the island of Sardinia. Another friend, D. R., is also said to have been in prison for some time, and was released later on. However, I have not seen him any more, and I surmise that he is under surveillance and may not move about freely. He it is who brought the truth of Christ our King to my attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The world is entirely confused, for it fears what is coming; but we who have faith in the holy prophecies, which the Creator caused to be written, are in safety, because we believe in Jesus Christ, and live in him, thanks to his blood which he shed for us. If it should be his will, we too would be ready to give our life for the honor of his name. Surely his protection will not fail us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We continue to send the Italian </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> into Italy, and we hope that at least a few of those who are still free receive it. The fact that we have not received any letters from Italy since that country entered the war may be due to severe censorship of all outgoing mail. All the letters quoted above confirm the fact that the “strange work” has been entirely closed down in Italy by the action of the ‘great harlot’ and her lovers. By order of the Italian police, a number of the families whose providers were imprisoned wrote not to send any more literature or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely these reports from Italy will be of great interest and encouragement to the brethren everywhere, seeing that, because of their faithfulness and steadfastness, so many Italian brethren were taken to Rome, that age-old city of martyrdom and persecution, there to face their enemies, ‘for a witness against them. ’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For this little country we can only give the mere figures for eight months. They are as follows: Books, 539; booklets, 7,742; total literature, 8,281.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No news whatsoever has reached us from this country since the first May days of this year, when also the Grand Duchy was quickly gobbled up by the growing monster. We received only a few communications from brethren who were evacuated to France, but even from these we have not heard anything further since the occupation of France by the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The relatively few publishers in this country have always shown a fervent zeal for the Kingdom interests. The whip of the Hierarchy there was always in constant use, as evidenced by the many persecutions of the past years. The few who dared escape that system were all the more happy and grateful to have found the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>THE NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In this country during the past year a work has been accomplished which has had no equal in Holland. In no other country has there been such a tremendous progress in spite of the difficulties due to the political constellation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We point out that the figures given comprise only nine months’ activity. Let us now compare same with the results of 1939, which had also been very gratifying compared with</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">former success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1940 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,880 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,215</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">This work was accomplished by nearly twice as many publishers as during the preceding year, m 127,455 hours (nearly 30,000 more than m 1939). They gained 100 subscriptions more than last year, namely, 797, and distributed 5,000 more magazines than in 1939, i.e., 52,401. The number of back-calls has also increased. (However, the sound attendance does not compare at all with that of the previous year; indeed we are not able to understand why there were five tunes less than in 1939. We conjecture that the war trouble made it impossible for the sound-cars to be used.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Duiing the course of the year Holland reported once 37 organized companies. However, as reported by a pioneer who worked in Holland and recently returned to Switzerland, the organized activity of the companies naturally suffers under present circumstances. This pioneer, who before and during the invasion fought valiantly in Holland, brought us a report from the branch servant of the Society there, from which we quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I am very pleased to send you a report in this way. The Lord has led all things marvelously. All the brethren continue in their offices, nothing has been changed in this, and all the warriors are still at the front. Nothing is too marvelous for the Lord. No one of the Lord’s people perished in the war. Even under the greatest bombardment the brethren were preserved. Also the 100,000 booklets were preserved as a testimony, were delivered to us, and are already distributed. Many brethren have indeed been marvelously protected during the course of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Since the war the work has progressed as never before, both as regards distribution and the gathering of the ‘great multitude’. The bound books have all been dispatched and distributed even by most of the companies. There are now only a few copies left of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font5"> (Hollandish), of which we had printed a new edition of 50,000 copies. Within two months after the war more than 160 brethren were immersed. A further number will be baptized during the coming weeks. It is not a seldom occurrence that people who know the truth but a fortnight participate in the work and identify themselves fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘During the war considerable funds were received. A friend of the truth gave Fl. 7,000. I would have been pleased to send you this amount, but as the Florin has lost its value abroad, I bought the property at Leersum, in order to secure the value of the money received, and hope I have acted according to your wishes. Today, already, we are offered Fl. 1,000 more in cash payment than we paid. The price of landed property is going up week by week, because the moneyed people are anxious to invest their wealth m something stable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘As we didn’t receive any literature from you after the war, I began to have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> (Hollandish) printed here in the same size and with the same number of pages, namely, 32, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> English. Of every edition we printed 15,000 copies, while before the war we had been able to order but 4,000 to 5,000 copies from you. The issues for the months up to and including September had been printed beforehand, and every edition contained 24 pages of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font5"> On July 6, the Gestapo came and sealed the machines. In the office in Heemstede they sealed one room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘Now we have two outside printers. From these we have received already 15,000 copies of the October issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> (Hollandish) and 2,000 copies of the August issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> (Hollandish). In this issue we published some of the smaller articles printed in the German </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Now a few days ago we received the July issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">(English), so that the chief article thereof will be published in our September issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;One printing factory is manufacturing the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, </span><span class="font5">and to another printer we have given order to print the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> as well as a booklet. 50,000 copies will be printed of this booklet, while the books will be published in editions of 10,000 copies each. The contents of the booklet are taken from the first half of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font5"> and from the second half of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Please continue to send the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to the addresses known to Brooklyn. If we get but one of the copies forwarded we may continue to publish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> We rejoice very much that by the means of these outside factories the Lord helps us to continue His work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The package with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> (English) of May came only to hand beginning of August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Just now we are also busy manufacturing 100 phonographs. The boxes are supplied by one firm, the parts we get from another, and the actual mounting is done by ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Up to now five brothers have been arrested, among them one German. One of them was arrested last week because of spreading the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font5"> The first four brothers were taken to Germany, and of one of them we know that he is in the prison of Muenster. As to the fate of the three others we have received no news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Gestapo forbade the work in Holland on July 1, 1940, but the decree has not been published either over the radio or through the press. Therefore I have not informed the brethren that the work is forbidden. As long as there is no legal publication of such decree I do not tell the brethren about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The zeal and joy of the brethren have much increased since the war. The wonderful dehverance by the Lord, which many brethren experienced in the midst of the greatest cannonfire, has done much to strengthen their faith and confidence in the Lofd, and now they show their gratitude by increased activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The two boats are still in use as well. I fear, however, that they may soon attract the attention of the German authorities, and then I expect the two vessels will be expropriated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Kingdom Home in L. is still in full activity, also the one in A. In the window of the latter we show Bibles only now, also in the shop we restrict ourselves to the sale of Bibles only. Since the war we have sold an extraordinary amount of Bibles and New Testaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“With the invasion of Holland we lost all connection with Belgium. I hope, however, that it may be resumed next month. Our connection with G. is also interrupted and not re-established as yet. It is extraordinarily difficult to cross the frontier to G. The Gestapo told us in our office that there was still bvely activity on the part of Jw in G. and that this was the chief reason for them to suppress the work in Holland, because they believed that everything was directed and supplied from here....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Hollandish police are on our side and they were indignant about the action of the Gestapo. The property of the Society is altogether preserved as yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Wishing that Jehovah may give you and your co-workers ever greater joy, wisdom and peace, in order to continue His work, I remain with cordial greetings, also from God’s family in Holland, by God’s grace, your brother and fellow-servant for the Theocracy. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The consignment of 100,000 booklets (mentioned in the re port) and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> (Hollandish) arrived in Rotterdam im mediately before the outbreak of hostilities. When Rotterdam was intensely bombarded—one-third of the city is reported to be entirely demolished—the cartons of literature were still lying at the Goods Station which was destroyed by fire. However, the booklets, although surrounded by the flames, were not consumed. They were then transported by lorry to the Society’s office. The driver, an outsider, pale of face and in great excitement, called at the office and asked the brother who received him: &quot;Whatever is there in these boxes? The Goods Station Rotterdam was all ablaze, and this consignment could be saved in spite of it! And on top of this, I now come from Rotterdam without having been stopped a single time by the military patrols; before and behind me, throughout the journey, all ears, vehicles and passers-by were stopped, and I passed right through.’’ The brother answered: &quot;This was not allowed to burn; the people must first know of this message. ’ ’ Naturally the driver was interested and took books and booklets with </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the bombardment of Rotterdam a building with 500 people in it was hit. All of them either perished or were injured, with the exception of four witnesses of Jehovah who happened to be at the entrance, and who through the powerful air pressure were thrown onto the street, receiving no hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was an invalid sister in a flat in Rotterdam, and a few witnesses of Jehovah visiting. Her bed was placed near the window, and as the air-raid alarm sounded a brother advised that the bed be removed to the inner wall. Hardly had this been done when a bomb hit the very place where the bed had stood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother reported that his farm was preserved during the war, while around it everything had been shot to smithereens. This brother grows and supplies vegetables to a pioneer home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A certain brother was five months in jail, and a few days before the German invasion he was released. The first day of the war a bomb fell on this very prison, killing and injuring many of the inmates; prison guards numbered among the injured ones. Also another brother was held in this same prison a few days before the war, but was released on account of his poor physical condition. Still elsewhere a brother was in a prison which was bombarded; he remained unhurt and fled from the prison with the consent of the superintendent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the pioneers from the pioneer home L. were arrested. The soldiers had surrounded the house under the lead of an officer. They thought that there would be Germans in the house, because previously there had been pioneers of this nationality there. The only German sister that had remained had fortunately left a few days before. After a short arrest the pioneers, being all of Hollandish nationality, were released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among many others a certain little town was evacuated. A sister living there exhibited in her window an electric sign bearing the words, &quot;The Theocracy brings life—Dictatorship brings death! ’’ which sign she carefully left switched on during her absence for three days and nights. Thus the German soldiers entering the town received an interesting witness, and the neighborhood came to know about it. When the sister upon her return removed the sign, she was asked why she did this. She explained: “The sign has fulfilled its purpose; you will now experience yourselves the truth of those words.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking merely from a human viewpoint, and from that of world events, one would be inclined to say that Poland has sunken into appalling darkness, so little is to be heard as to present happenings in that part of Europe. The cruelty and violence with which the harmless people of Poland were subdued by the monster are in themselves alone already so contrary to any law of the nations that such outrage would have to be pointed to time and again by historians, if such history would continue to be written also in the future as has been done through the past centuries. But thanks be to the Lord for his promise to revenge all oppression and violence in Armageddon and to judge with righteousness “the poor of the people” who, shall be “of good-will”. (Psalm 72) “The Lord shall count, when he wnteth up the people, that this man was born there ’ ’ (Ps. 87: 6) ; and thus Jehovah, the just God, on that great day of His battle, will remember the many faithful ones of His people of which there are surely also many in Poland. Yea, we are convinced that all those in Poland who are truly consecrated to the Lord will even now, when they have lost all connection with the rest of the faithful on earth, and when they are hard pressed by the enemy, be able to stand upright and to be seen by people of good-will as a “pillar to the Lord”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the dividing up of Poland between Germany and Russia, we have hardly had any connection with the brethren there. We have no figures at all on any work done. The branch servant, who always performed his work most faithfully and conscientiously, was imprisoned and the Society’s property placed under State (German) administration. AH that we have been able to learn since is from a postcard, saying that the branch servant was released, the authorities having evidently not been able to find in him the guilt that they sought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So the cry of groaning creation for deliverance rises ever louder to Jehovah. What joy for God’s people now to call to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">d the words of Jesus, “When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh”I</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">While we are writing this report the monster has shown its greed for a further victim: Rumania. Although they talk only of a control by Germany of the Rumanian oil wells, the independence of that land has thereby practically ceased to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in that country have always had to suffer severe persecution, and in recent years there was hardly any organized activity there, but now the brethren will also soon get to feel the rod of the Nazi vandals. However, the Lord will know how to protect the faithful there too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The figures reported show that the publishing work was much greater than in 1939. The report including only eight months is as follows: Books, 371; booklets, 35,792; total literature, 36,163.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Full of joy and enthusiasm, also gratitude towards our dear heavenly Father, we compile the report for the past year; for the Lord has caused his people to do great things in this country! God’s people were watchful and alert also in Switzerland; for some time they had observed how difficulties began to arise. For years already the Hierarchy has done a secret as well as an open work to harm the Society. Taught by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> that the Kingdom publishing work would reach a climax and that then 'the kingdom of heaven would suffer violence’ (Matt. 11: 12), the publishers in Switzerland engaged in the work with full battle-strength, and their efforts were &quot;not in vain in the Lord”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While this report is being compiled the branch servant is under indictment on the part of the military authorities, and an exa</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">minin</span><span class="font5">g judge has already threatened him with imprisonment and prohibitive measures against the Watch Tower Society, as well as against the Swiss Association of Jehovah’s witnesses. All that the Lord permits will be right, and as long as we continue to enjoy freedom we shall do all in our strength to encourage God’s people in this land to stand faithfully and fearlessly with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The war had begun in September. How appropriate then the service period &quot;The Theocracy” which lasted throughout the month of October! </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font5">ost. 1,000 publishers took part. This campaign ope</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font5">g the fiscal year was supported by many public lectures with lantern slides comprising three evenings each on the following subjects: &quot;Government and Peace”; &quot;Fill the Earth”; &quot;Religion and Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The splendid attendance was evidence that the attention of the publie had been powerfully drawn to these lectures. Already at the first session the enemy showed up: it was forbidden, and the owner of the hall was approached and asked to cancel the contract. This man, however, protested against such intervention in his business affairs and stated to the authorities in question that our people were known to him as respectable citizens, that therefore he placed his property at the disposal of Jw, and he even demanded that a lecture be given, which was done, and was well attended. We filed a protest with a higher authority against such arbitrary procedure on the part of the officials of the town in question, whereupon the latter</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">were instructed to permit the lecture they had at first prohibited. From that time onward, the whole lecture campaign, with but one exception, could be carried through with the greatest success during the whole winter until well into spring. The second exception aforementioned refers to a chiefly Catholic place, where, on the second evening, the police appeared and demanded that the audience leave the hall and that our apparatus be dismantled, whereupon the people, very indignant, left the premises. One attending stated to the policemen accompanied by a member of the Town Council that such an absolutely unjust action against men who desired only the right would fall back on their own heads. The authorities maintained their ban, but renounced their threat of punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were, all together, 55 such series of three lectures during Jhe winter, attended by 20,000 people. In addition there were 57 lectures without lantern sides from November to April. Thus the attention of the Swiss public was most effectively drawn upon the work of Jw, there was much talk about it and the press had many things to report. One felt instinctively that our witnessing activity would soon reach a climax. More and more one could hear the people expressing themselves in this way: “Jehovah’s witnesses are courageous people, they have an immovable conviction for which they stand with enthusiasm. It is just that vivacity which the church circles lack. One sees more and more that Jw ‘hit the nail on the head’ in their Biblical explanations.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We did not fail to give full information to all the competent authorities, the Army included, concerning the purpose of our movement. It was all the more necessary to do this, as our opponents, secretly National Socialist elements, and their press, as well as “Catholic Action’’, made unceasing efforts to cause the authorities to doubt our motives as explained to them by us. It seemed as though “Catholic Action” especially, not having found a sufficiently hearing ear for their slanders with the authorities, in their rage took recourse to acts of violence, in the same way as 1900 years ago, when the scribes and Pharisees could not get what they at first had wanted from Pilate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a strictly Catholic town of eastern Switzerland a modest witness, on a Sunday forenoon, went from door to door with the message of God’s Kingdom in obedience to the Lord’s commandment. Thereby he happened to call at the home of the editor of a Catholic paper published in that town. The witness was received by his wife, who invited </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> in. The brother, not knowing that he was at the house of a genuine Jesuit, accepted the invitation to enter and was then received by the editor himself. While in simple language he was giving the witness, Mr. Editor, assisted by a young man who in the meantime had appeared on the scene and who evidently was a hot Catholic Actionist, began to strike the brother with a chair and a cudgel, so that he sank to the ground strea</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">g with blood, where they left </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5">. In the meantime the wife of the editor had telephoned a policeman for the brother to be taken into custody. When the latter arrived he quickly rendered first aid to the victim. The brother had to have medical treatment, and it was easy for the doctor to confirm the seriousness of the injuries. But it was not easy for us to file a complaint against the attacker, because there were no neutral witnesses, and we had to expect that Mr. Editor and his young accomplice would have simply denied the facts, as cowards are used to doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus during the time of the war psychosis one became aware of the fact that the fight between the two, humanly speaking, very unequal opponents was tapering to a climax. The time of the Memorial neared, and there was heard the urgent desire to have a larger assembly of God’s people in Switzerland, so as to gather new strength for the great conflict that according to general expectation must undoubtedly be just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such a convention was organized and held in one of the largest auditoriums in Berne, following the Memorial on Saturday evening. For the latter we also had to hire a larger hall than usual—which was placed at our disposal by the Berne School Board—so many visiting brethren coming already on the evening before the convention. The rich blessing of the Lord was our portion on that evening, and an abundance of such spiritual riches was showered upon us during the convention. It was probably the most unique assembly ever held of God’s people in Switzerland. 1,400 participated. There were many immersed, among them children of 10 and 11 years, who for a long time already had taken part in the service from house to house. The testimony meeting at this convention was a wonderful event. It demonstrated so clearly how the Lord is also now bringing the “other sheep” into his fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention unanimously adopted the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Besolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We, 1400 delegates assembled at the Annual Convention of the 'Association of Jehovah’s witnesses of Switzerland’ in Berne, have adopted the following ten statements as a resolution and have resolved to submit this declaration to the highest governmental authorities of Switzerland, to the press and to the general public:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“1) We, Jehovah’s witnesses of Switzerland, are a free association of Christians, who believe in Jehovah, that is, God, the Almighty One, and in Jesus Christ, the rightful ruler of The Theocracy, that is, God’s Kingdom. As devoted and obedient subjects of these divine governmental powers (see Bomans 13: 1) we declare this Theocracy or absolute ridership of God to be the only hope of salvation and testify the same to all persons of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“2) The Bible, God’s Word of Truth, is the highest rule in all matters of faith and conscience, and its commandments are our authority in all acts of life, and if we were forbidden to pubhsh the gospel of God’s Kingdom (see Matthew 24: 14), or hindered by police authorities or courts to live our faith, or were forced to deify men or human institutions, we would then follow the advice of the faithful apostles and ‘obey God rather than men’ (Acts 5: 29).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“3) Our position in regard, to the nations of this world, of which Jesus said, ‘My kingdom is not of this world,’ is the same as that of all those followers of Christ known in all lands of the earth as Jehovah’s witnesses, namely, absolute and strict neutrality based upon our sincere faith in the doctrine of Jesus Christ as contained in the Bible (Matthew 4: 8-10; -John 18: 36).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“4) We are, therefore, neither surprised nor discouraged if we experience from the representatives of this world, called ‘evil’ and ‘wicked’ by Paul and by John, the same as our Lord and Master, Jesus, experienced from the religious and political rulers of his time, and which persecutions he prophesied would come upon his true followers. ‘Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake’ (Matthew 24: 9); and, ‘If ye were of the world, 'the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you’ (John 15: 19, 20).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“5) We gladly declare ourselves in harmony and united closely in the fight of faith with the thousands of our brethren in the faith, Jehovah’s witnesses, who at present are suffering for Christ’s name’s sake and because of their faithfulness to Jehovah, particularly in anti-Christian and anti-democratic lands. Sympathizing with them in their suffering, we call attention to recent reliable reports that the number of martyrs among Jehovah’s witnesses who have proved their faithfulness unto death has increased within recent months and now comprises 80 persons (Revelation 2: 10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“6) In view of these persecutions of Christians in neighboring countries, we, Jehovah’s witnesses of Switzerland, are grateful first to God and then to the authorities of our fatherland for the protection of freedom in matters of faith and conscience which we have thus far enjoyed, and appreciate dwelling in a democratic land where these precious possessions are still guarded and cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“7) As qualified spiritual defenders of these Christian rights, we beg, nevertheless, in all modesty, to raise the warning and call attention to the fact that the radical and anti-democratic elements have found their strongest supporters in representatives of the Catholic and Hierarchical world viewpoint, which fact is confirmed in the fast-moving events of the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“8) We further declare that Jehovah’s witnesses belong to the quiet, peace-loving and dutiful citizens of the land maintaining state order, that none of us in any way concede to a totalitarian conception of state, neither to Communism nor to Fascism, nor to National Socialism, and that we refrain from any part in the politics or religions of the State, in accordance with the word of the apostle James, chapter 1, verse 27: ‘For the worship that is pure and holy before God the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, and that one keep himself unspotted from the world.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“9) We, Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore do not expect a permanent and just peace from the present peace machinations of the worldly diplomats and representatives of the religious, political and commercial elements, no more than we, twenty years ago, set any hope in the anti-God League of Nations, which had been falsely hailed by representatives of religion as the political expression of God’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“10) Contrary thereto, our only hope for peace, safety and salvation from the distress of Armageddon near at hand rests in Jehovah, the Most High, and in Christ, the rightful King of the Theocracy to be established upon the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">100,000 copies of this Resolution in German and French were placed in the hands of the people. It was also sent with a covering letter to all the editors of Switzerland, to all communal and Cantonal authorities, to all judicial authorities, to all the members of Parliament, and to the judges of the Swiss Federal Court. The Resolution made a deep impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the three months of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign the workers of the Lord in Switzerland put 26,181 books into the hands of the people, to compare with only 20,726 for the whole fiscal year 1939. The amount of booklets distributed in these three months, i.e., 114,897, is equal to one-third of the total yearly result. 1,136 publishers spent 45,883 hours in the field, made 8,607 back-calls, had 18,730 listeners to the recorded lectures, and distributed 67,134 magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the difficulties from the side of the military authorities concerning the frank speech of our publications reached a critical stage and we were threatened with preliminary censorship, the publishers increased their efforts still more. Every one of the new regular attendants at our meetings hearing of the growing difficulties wanted to take the perhaps last opportunity of giving a witness, and joined the ranks of the publishers, so that there were soon 1,323 warriors in the field. It was simply thr</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">illin</span><span class="font5">g to see this development and enthusiasm among God’s people in Switzerland, their companions and people of good-will. Attendance at the regional service conventions was ever greater, and soon the halls where similar meetings had formerly been organized were too small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On June 29 the Swiss Army Staff decreed preliminary censorship upon all our publications. This meant that from this date onward we were only authorized to print and distribute such publications as had first passed the military censorship office, including, of course, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> which contains the meat in due season from the Lord for his people. Naturally we could not accept such a measure, because God’s Word may not be subjected to human criticism or any alteration whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Considering now the publishing work accomplished during the past year in view of the extraordinary difficulties which have come upon God’s people in Switzerland, we can but acknowledge with great joy, but also in humility of heart, that the Lord by and through his weak forces in this country has done wonderful things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books, 86,259; booklets, 375,011; total literature, 461,270.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For the same reason as for Bulgaria, Rumania and Hungary a detailed report concerning the activity in Yugoslavia will be sent direct to the Brooklyn Office. From the correspondence received from the branch servant in Belgrade, we see that during the past year the Hierarchy have been still more active in that country in their endeavor to injure the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. The publishers of Yugoslavia have well recognized that ‘the days are evil and that therefore the time must be redeemed’; for the figures for 1940 show a very gratifying progress m the work of service. Here the comparative</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">figures:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1940 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,901 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,308</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">As compared with last year there were 33 publishers more, i.e., 108, and these brethren reached 7,176 more hours in the field, made 1,517 more back-calls, and had 2,361 more sound attendance. These results are all the more remarkable as the report for 1940 comprises but eleven months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font5">China, with her great population, is a dark place on the earth; for only a few are they who have turned their hearts to the Lord and see the light; but these few have put forth a faithful effort to present this gospel of the Kingdom that others might hear and know. Steeped in war, misery and great distress, it has been difficult for our brethren there to get on in the work. Private information from Hong Kong is to the effect that Shanghai is slowly being strangled to death, as has been the case of many of the interior cities of Greater China. The savage and merciless attack of the Japanese upon China has driven hundreds of these defenseless people off their land and rushed them together into poverty and distress. Every inch of the ground gained by the war against the Chinese now belongs to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, wherein she practices her wicked, God-dishonoring racket. If there were need of any further evidence that religion is of the Devil and that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy take the lead in this, that evidence is furnished by what has recently taken place in China and Japan. There have been formed into a combine Buddhism, Shintoism and Catholicism, which has received at the hands of the Hierarchy and Japanese a new title, to wit, “Pure Japanese Type of Christian Religion,” and this is used by them to further blind the people and to further dishonor the name of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hong Kong, as reported, is certainly one of the most vicious strongholds of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and the result is that the people are groping about in utter darkness so far as the appreciation of The Theockacy is concerned. Some local newspapers, seeing the situation, expressed their desire to know more about the truth; and when the matter is presented to them for publication, their reply is, “We dare not print anything against the Catholics, as the Colony is too strong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A servant of the Lord from Hong Kong writes: “The message of the truth is surely getting under the old lady’s skin and causing much pain and discomfort. It is quite evident that she is rapidly becoming as uneasy as were her prototypes, the devil-worshipers of .Ashdod.” Further reporting on the work in different parts of China, one of the faithful servants of the Lord says: “I can confidently say on behalf of all the workers in China that we are fully determined to carry the fight right on to the end. Come what may, we know the ultimate result will be the complete establishment of The Theocracy, the government which will bring to the people life everlasting in perfect conditions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s local servant at Shanghai reports amongst other things the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the be</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ginni</span><span class="font5">ng of the year the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font5"> was translated and printed for distribution among the Chinese population. Just then the political rulers were loudly proclai</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">g a peace regime in an effort to further deceive the people. After more than two years of fighting, weariness and despair have entered into the heart of everyone. It was then an appropriate time for Jehovah’s witnesses to announce to the people of good-will in this country who love righteousness and who desire a better government under which to live in peace and happiness that God’s Theocracy under Christ is the only hope and means of their relief; and the booklet served the purpose very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Chinese &quot;Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chinese people have suffered intensely on account of the war. Their once peaceful homes were broken up and destroyed. They have been driven from place to place seeking refuge, but </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">findin</span><span class="font5">g none. Now they are confronted with poverty and starvation and even death. They are in a more deplorable condition than ever before and greatly in need of consolation. At the present time our work is confined to the city of Shanghai, with a population of approximately five million. Conditions do not permit us to send workers into the neighboring cities. The Post Office had sometime ago declared that no printed matter, books or magazines, be conveyed into the interior provinces, except newspapers. We feel that something ought to be done, but what can we do to comfort those that mourn? Por many years this Branch has been contemplating the publishing of a Chinese magazine, printed locally, but for some reasons we have not been able to carry out this praiseworthy objective. However, the time finally came when the workers in the British Isles sent us an urgent request for Chinese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> promising to give full support and co-operation. This gave us more courage to go ahead. So by the end of May the first issue of the Chinese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> was ready for circulation. Later, this magazine wap registered at the Post Office as a newspaper, and it is now gradually finding its way into the provinces where gross darkness prevails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we learned that a world-wide Theocratic convention was to take place it was unanimously decided that we should keep pace and have our own convention; and we had it. Two days, July 27 and 28, were set apart for the purpose. The eon vention, though small in number, was represented by ten na tionalities; truly an international one. The mornings were de voted to house-to-house witnessing. In spite of the summer heat, the conventioners took part in the field service joyfully and energetically. It was a real inspiration to the other sheep of the Lord. The result was very gratifying and to the praise of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“We are not Ignorant of his devices.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As soon as the convention was over we learned, through a reliable source, that one parson of a certain Hebrew mission made the statement to this effect: that ‘Jehovah’s witnesses have been increasing in number in this vicinity and we’ve got to do something to check them’. Another </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mis</span><span class="font5">sion was reported to have hatched wicked devices in an attempt to thwart the onward march of Jehovah’s “strange work”, but we are fully confident that ‘no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper’. “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Gives the Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After many years of hard labor, beset on every hand with incessant troubles due to political strifes and wars, we find that the Lord’s faithful servant, unlike the one who received his talent, hid it and grumbled the while against his master for being so severe (Matt. 25: 24-27), has, rather, pressed forward patiently and joyfully, doing what he could to discharge the duty assigned to him m this good fight for His name’s sake, knowing that ‘our labor is not in vain m the Lord’. (1 Cor. 15: 58) In due time the Lord gives the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Realizing the fact that the end is rapidly approaching and that ‘ ‘ time is no more ’ ’ before Armageddon, the ‘ ‘ other sheep ’ ’ of the Lord have awakened to their privilege and have put forth their best endeavors to witness for The Theocracy while the door is still open. ‘We must work while it is day, for the night cometh, when no man can work,’ says our Master. (John 9: 4) In order that a thorough witness might be given, the publishers, at the beginning of the fiscal year, adopted the new method of service according to the Society’s instructions. Territories were assigned to the publishers, maps supplied, etc., and this has worked very well. No doubt it has the Lord’s blessing and approval. The publishers find that they can cover more territory than they had at first anticipated. In former years the witness work was largely confined to the European element, but this year it was chiefly done among the Chinese. The report shows that out of the total placement of 20,000 pieces of literature 15,000 were in the Chinese language. Later, fieldservice good-hope slips were issued, the publishers stating in advance what they hope to accomplish during the ensuing week, establishing an objective to work to. This has greatly increased the hours in the field service. The more hours, the more placements. At present there are seven pioneers and thirteen company workers, representing seven different nationalities—an increase of seven publishers in all over last year. The total placement for the year, as compared to that of last year or of any preceding year, shows an increase of three hundied percent— a crowning year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Night Is Falling Fast</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been reported in the newspapers recently that in Japan three religions, namely, Buddhism, Shintoism and Catholicism, have formed a combine that they call the “pure Japanese type of Christian religion”. It is further reported that Japan is going to send missionaries to China to propagate this “pure Japanese type of Christian religion” and to take over the work of all the “Christian” churches in the provinces that are under her control. This would mean that they will compel the foreign missionaries and church leaders to abandon their mission work and leave China. The day is not far distant when those gentlemen will have to remove their clerical garments and don the overalls and try to find some honest work in their home countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Machine</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is utterly impossible to operate a sound machine in Shanghai, on account of the many restrictions. The English people are haughty and self-righteous, and only a small number of Chinese can follow the recorded speeches. Therefore the use of phonographs is limited to back-calls only. The transcription machine is doing a good work at model studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Studies and Service Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The number attending study classes varies from 15 to 20. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> study has been completed and the friends are now taking </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> No. 2. The regular </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font5"> studies, including the one in German, are getting on very well and without interruption. Even during the rainy season and after a heavy storm, when the streets are all flooded, the attendants have to remove their boots and wade it. Great fun! The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font5"> have been a source of real comfort and joy, refreshing our souls and increasing our knowledge and strength and the zeal peculiar to His house. Up to the present time most of the attendants continue to be active publishers. Service meetings are also a source of encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Glorying In Tribulation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shanghai has been subjected to all kinds of crimes since the outbreak of hostilities three years ago, and the situation grows •from bad to worse. Murders, assassinations, kidnapings, strikes, and, worst of all, profiteering on daily necessities, such as food, fuel and house rent, etc., add more sorrow and distress to the common people, especially the wage-earning classes. Our pioneer brethren, too, because of the high cost of living, have had a very difficult time in meeting their obligations. In order to help and comfort them the other sheep of the Lord are cheerfully and willingly doing their bit. A collection box is in evidence at every meeting to receive such financial aid as the friends are able to give. One British brother gives free lodging to three German pioneers and one meal per week. In time off sickness doctor service and medical treatment are given freely. He shall not fail to receive his reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On August 12, one of our pioneers, a Syrian, was arrested and taken into custody by the police while witnessing m the French Concession, on the charge of peddling without a license. This afforded the brother a wonderful opportunity to give si witness to the authorities in the police station and before the court. The judge, seeing that there is nothing wrong in our work, decided to let the brother go, advising him not to come there again. But the police (probably a Catholic) insisted that the ordinance must be upheld and imposed a fine of $5.00. Our brother, on principle, refused to pay the fine, and for this rea son he was incarcerated for twenty-four hours in a dark, dirtj cell. Later, three letters of protest were sent to the chief of police, French consular general and the judge, and after ten days a reply was received from the police stating that the defendant was asking donations from the people for his books, thus constituting a commercial transaction, for which, accord ing to the ordinance, a special permit is required from the authority, but the defendant failed to produce such, and further stating that the defendant was causing a riot in one of the Chinese homes; which was untrue. Anyway, we knew what would be the outcome, and the publishers are going serenely onward in their work regardless of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Prospects for the Coming Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not satisfied with the present result of our activities. More workers are needed in the field. A quota of four new publishers was set at the time of the convention, and we are pleased to say that two have already entered the field. It is recognized that unless the people of good-will are brought into the fold and become active witnesses they will not be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger. So it becomes our bounden duty to see to it that the back-call work is kept well to the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As our field of activity is limited to Shanghai at present, it is sincerely hoped that in the near future some workers may be sent to the neighboring towns to explore the situation and see what can be done. Our constant prayer is that the Lord may open the way for the light to shine to “them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death”. There is no possibility of getting into the provinces now, because of the political situation; nevertheless we are on the alert, hoping for opportunities to again renew the work in these provinces. This may never be. Time alone can tell. However, while the door of service is still open in Shanghai it is our determination to keep lifting up high the standard of The Theocracy for the people, to warn the wicked ones and to feed the truth-hungry. We are very grateful to the Lord for the timely advice and counsel we have received through his organization, and hope that these favors may continue until the &quot;strange work” is done.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font5">Greece is in a sorry way. Hounded from within by political religious rulers and pressed from without by vicious gangsters who have now begun an assault upon Greece, the people are put in a bad way to do anything towards peace, righteousness and right living. Those of Jehovah’s witnesses in that land have been greatly hounded during the year. Brave souls these Grecian brethren are, and, following the course taken by early Christians, they are plodding along under the greatest handicap in their endeavor to be shining lights for the great Theocratic Government, which soon shall relieve all the oppressed of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Society’s local servant in Athens the following information is received and here inserted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notwithstanding the bitter attacks of the enemy against the Lord’s people here, God has been with us to deliver us from the hand of the enemy. In our experiences we saw clearly the truthfulness of the promise of the Lord: ‘ ‘ And they shall light against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” Truly, our hearts rejoice in His salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord granted to three of us to be condemned by the Court of Appeals (to which we appealed after our condemnation by the Court of Common Pleas to four months of imprisonment) to 40 days of imprisonment and to a fine of 5,000 drachmas each of us, though no evidence was presented against us in the Court. But even in the prison the Lord granted us many opportunities to speak of The Theocratic Government as the only place of safety and the only hope of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After two months seven of us were again summoned to the Court under the charge that we made propaganda trying to prevent the people from going to war, if they were called by the government to do so. The Lord put to shame his enemies, and our ease was dismissed. Again after a while I was summoned to the court under the charge that I was circulating books the contents of which were against the ehureh, without the stamp required by the law. The Lord again put to shame his enemies and the case was dismissed, though as a witness against me was the secretary of the Synod of Archbishops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Owing to many severe orders of the Office of the Security of the State against us, about thirty brethren from different parts of Greece were displaced to small villages and islands, as dangerous to the church and to the state, for terms of six months to one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year we had thirty eases in the courts, involving 52 brethren. Of them 25 were condemned to imprisonment from six months to two years. Some of the eases were dismissed, and some of them are pending in the courts. The imposed fine amounted to 45,000 drachmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three of the brethren refused to take arms, and one of them was condemned to eight months of imprisonment by the Martial Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year about eighty brethren and sisters symbolized their full consecration to the Lord.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people that inhabit the Hawaiian Islands are of many nationalities. The number of those who are in the Kingdom service on this group of islands is not great, but their zeal and untiring devotion to the Lord is great and they are putting forth their very best endeavors to serve, and a wide and effective witness has been given during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Says the report of the local servant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rich blessing of Jehovah has been manifested through persons of good-will taking their stand for The Theocracy and sharing in the work of inviting others to come and take the water of life freely. During the year 71 different persons engaged in the house-to-house witness, back-calls, information marches and other means of witnessing, which is twice as many publishers as ever before. This year a total of 11,769 hours were spent in the field, which is 3,309 more hours than in the year 1939. It is with great joy that ‘people of all nations, kindreds and tongues’ are observed taking their stand before the throne, and crying out Jehovah’s praises. This is actually happening, as among the publishers are those of Hawaiian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Puerto Bican, Portuguese, Filipino, European and American ancestry. The following dialects are represented among the local Filipino brethren: Hocano, Tagalog, and Cebu-Visayan. Literature has been placed in all of these languages and dialects; also in German, Bussian and Polish. Meetings are held in Hocano, Spanish, Japanese, and English. All the publishers work together happily in the service of the great Theocrat, even though they speak different languages and are at times hard put to understand one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The many provisions Jehovah has made that his “strange work’’ might be carried on in the Hawaiian Islands, including Bibles with liteiature and recordings in explanation theieof in many languages and dialects; the sending down by radio of the inspiring message from Detroit on July 28; the gift of the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion;</span><span class="font5"> the sustaining “food convenient’’ served in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font5"> the building of Kingdom halls and pioneer homes on the islands of Oahu, Maui and Kauai (with another Kingdom hall under construction now on the island of Hawaii), as well as many, many other needs for the work, are gladly acknowledged. They are received with much gratitude to the Lord, and, by His grace, these are and will be used to the glory and honor of the great Theocrat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are six pioneers and one zone servant in the islands. The pioneers are overcoming handicaps of ill health, increasing age, loss of limbs, rainy and hot weather, long distances to cover in witnessing, back-calling, and in meeting with those of good-will. But they are pressing on joyfully in obedience to Jehovah’s command. In addition to placing much literature, they have been used of the Lord to hold and organize model studies and meetings, immersions, and to provide a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom hall on the island of Maui, and a Kingdom home on the island of Kauai. The area of the islands being limited, they go over and over the same territory many times, enabling them to cooperate with and be of much assistance to those of good-will. The totals of the work of the pioneers and zone servant are:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The cost of travel between the islands being excessive, and in view of world conditions, it is essential for the interests of the work to have headquarters for meetings and for storage of literature on each island. Thanks to Jehovah, this is being accomplished, for which we are indeed grateful to him, and to the instruments used in making such provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Kingdom Hall in Honolulu is located the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., branch office. A large stock of literature and recordings is maintained there and from there shipped out to the pioneers and publishers on other islands. This is also the meeting place of the Honolulu company. During the year seven regular weekly meetings were conducted there and at other points in Honolulu, with a total attendance of 3,257. Additionally, model studies were held. At Kingdom Hall 3 brethren devote their full time to the work and are rejoicing in many varied privileges of service. Their field report for the year is:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At Wailuku, Mam, the Lord provided a Kingdom hall for literature storage and a meeting place, and as a home for the pioneer witnesses on that island. This was completed in the month of June. The two brethren at that place are happy in the service and rejoicing in many privileges of service. Their field service is reported under the pioneer totals and company figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through Jehovah’s provision the construction of a Kingdom hall has just been started at Hilo, Hawaii, and it is hoped and expected that this will also be the means of honoring the name of Jehovah, and for strengthening and encouraging all those of good-will on that island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Immersion services were held during the year, and a total of 29 persons were reported immersed.</span></p>

In addition, service meetings are held. Then studies are held at all these places in Hocano, Spanish, and Japanese. Complete attendance for the year is not had, but a total is reported of 6,489. Although far removed geographically, the publishers in the Hawaiian Islands enjoy the same rich, stimulating spiritual food which the Lord serves to all those who love and obey Him; for which we return heartfelt thanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the start of the year 30 persons were engaging regularly in the house-to-house witness. During the year the number has steadily increased and 71 different persons have shared in the work, with a monthly average of 56 publishers. This figure includes the children who are happy to have a share in giving testimony. The age of the publishers varies from 6 years' to over 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notification that Honolulu would be one of the cities receiving the public address by Brother Rutherford on July 28 was received with much joy and enthusiasm. This meant that those in the outside islands could hear, too, although unable to get to Honolulu, as they could tune in the radio carrier beam which brought the message to Honolulu from the mainland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many signs 4 feet by 9 feet, and auto-tire signs, were painted and used to properly advertise and invite people to join in hearing the important message. Placards were used for the information marches, and also placed in store windows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That as many as possible might hear, arrangements were made for the address to be picked up and heard at Kingdom halls in Honolulu, Oahu, and at Wailuku, Mauai, also at Hilo and Pahala on the island of Hawaii, and at two points on the island of Kauai. A total of 37,250 handbills were distributed from house to house, in stores, offices, public buildings and at entrances of large pineapple canneries. Many parades of cars decorated with large signs and placards, and using sound announcements, were held in Honolulu, Hilo and Wailuku. Information marches were held in business sections, also residential parts of these three cities, and much attention attracted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday morning, 10: 30 Honolulu time, audiences gathered at the six arranged places and greatly enjoyed the address. The only effort to interfere was at Pahala, where someone turned off the electric current just as the announcement of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> was made. It was quickly restored, and little was missed. Loud-speakers were used outside the meeting places, and many heard on their own short-wave sets, especially in the outside islands, where a great many are in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> came as a happy surprise, and all the autographed edition available except two were quickly placed. It was a thrilling occasion and a source of encouragement and strength. All present joined in voting <sup>&lt;f</sup>Aye” to the liesolution. Then we were overjoyed to be able to hear Brother Rutherford’s closing words to the convention, and it was just as if we were present. In all it constituted a great witness in the islands, and will be even further extended when the recordings of it arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past year has been an extremely happy one spent in serving the great Theocrat, and for its privileges of service and blessings all the publishers in the islands join in returning thanks to Jehovah. To you, Brother Rutherford, they requested that expression be made of their warm Christian love and of their appreciation of the message in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Daily we remember at the throne of grace those in charge of the work in the earth, and those of our brethren who are giving testimony despite the enemy’s attacks and persecution, and pray the rich blessing and protection of Jehovah may continue upon all his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font5">India, being a part of the Commonwealth of the British Empire, is affected by the war, and that has its influence upon the witness work in that country. That country has long been under the dominant influence of demonism, and hence the great mass of the population is steeped in ignorance concerning Jehovah’s purpose. The report of the Society’s local servant recites the fact that military service by all the population between the ages of 18 and 50 is demanded, and the following letter was sent by him to the National Service Committee:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chairman,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">National Service Advisory Committee,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chamber of Commerce, Bombay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We submit below the names of all the male European British subjects working on behalf of this Society in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We, as Jehovah’s witnesses, are engaged in the service of Jehovah God from which we cannot withdraw for any reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are true Christians engaged in the proclamation of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, which will soon be fully established with Christ as King. Pledged to that Theocratic Government and Christ the King we cannot take sides for or against any political government now on earth, but in accordance with the Word of God we maintain absolute neutrality as did Jesus Christ in the affairs of political governments. Jesus said: ‘My Kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants light, that I should not be delivered'to the Jews.’ (Jolin 18: 36; see also John 15: 19; 17: 14; and 2 Timothy 2: 3,4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the above reason we claim exemption from either military or civil employment under the conscientious objector’s clause of the National Service Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enclosed booklet entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Neutrality</span><span class="font5"> is respectfully presented to your committee to show more fully our position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total number of books and booklets distributed amongst the people of India during the year was 110,552.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s “strange woik’’ continues to progress in India. It is indeed a strange work in a strange land. Nowhere on earth can one imagine there to be a stranger medley of peoples than in India. Religion is by far the worst enemy of all the strange systems by which the Devil has subjugated these people. When educated men are tightly held in the grip of religious superstition, it is not surprising that the millions who are entirely illiterate are quite outside the scope of effective witnessing to the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just now in Bombay someone has discovered an ancient idol of the ‘ ‘ god ’ ’ Shiva A newspaper report says that the mayor and several of the city officials were among the thousands who visited the idol and that “it is presumed that the municipality will give a site for the construction of a small temple”. Shiva is one of the three gods in the Hindu trinity. The Encyclopedia says: ‘ ‘ His worslnp is a type of phalhcism. ’ ’ These city officials are a fair sample of India’s educated men. What may one expect of the 300 million who have no education at all? Their minds aie just demonized to saturation point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The so-called “Christian” is often in a still worse state. Roman Catholics will parade through the streets of Bombay following an idol of “St Anthony” or some grotesque misrepresentation of Jesus or Mary in just the same way as these Hindus follow their gods m procession. The mentality, if they have any, of both Hindu and Roman Catholic is exactly the same. Now they all appeal to their various “gods” for guidance in the prosecution of war against the worshipers of the same ‘ ‘ gods ’’ in other lands. The Catholics should know better, for their own Bible says: “Neither shalt thou make nor set up to thyself a statue; which things the Lord thy God hateth.” (Deut. 16: 22, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is amidst such strange conditions that Jehovah’s witnesses continue their work announcing the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The result of the last year’s work is an all-round increase: more publishers, more hours in field service, and more liteiature placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The actual placement of literature during the year was 110,004, which is an increase of 7,887 over the previous year. The following table shows how this distribution was made. The total number of books and booklets sent out from the branch office was 115,918.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We commenced the year with the storm of war just breaking. Its effect upon the work of the Kingdom has not been felt to any appreciable extent yet. So far as the publishers are concerned there has been no official interference with their activity, though there is now a conscription law in force upon all male European British subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 for both military and civil service. Our six English pioneers and office staff are just now, as this report is being compiled, being questioned as to their availability for national service. So far as the general public is concerned the “war fever” has taken hold in a general way. This causes some to be more curious as to the meaning of Bible prophecy, whilst others are scared and so fully occupied with war activities as to close their minds to anything associated with Jehovah’s Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only real hindrance to the proclamation of the truth has been interference on the part of the censors with our supply of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> All our office supplies have been withheld since March. Individually addressed copies from America continue to filter&quot; through to subscribers. Some have received all their copies, whilst some have not received any at all, or just occasional copies. This matter has been taken up with the authorities, but no satisfactory reply has been given. A letter has been addressed to the viceioy about this unfair treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the high-lights of interest during the year are briefly reported, as follows: Wherever opposition has been organized it has been met with increased activity. Early in the year two Indian pioneers were assaulted by an Indian pastor for distributing literature amongst his flock. Leaflets drawing attention to this fight of “religion” against Christianity were immediately printed and distributed in the locality and a soundcar rushed to the town for a series of lectures. The result of that effort was that a group of Indian Christians had their eyes opened to the difference between religion and Christianity and are now actively engaged in publishing the message of The Theocracy. Recently a somewhat similar incident took place in northern India. Leaflets were distributed, and the town was visited a second time by a party of pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At another town a crowd of Roman Catholics tried to induce the civil power to prohibit the use of the transcription machine. A petition signed by 150 people, including three Roman Catholic priests, was sent to the magistrate, complaining of the “insult” to their church. An inquiry followed, with the result that the work was allowed to continue and the 150 signatories to the petition warned not to interfere with the work of the sound-car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the month of January a party of pioneers in Travan-core hired a country boat and made a tour of villages isolated in the “backwaters”. About 1,000 people hstened to lectures, and some six hundred books and booklets were left with the people. Sixteen villages, which are otherwise impossible to reach, were given an effective witness in this land of rice fields and palm trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An Indian pioneer has just reported good work with the “Government and Peace” lecture records. He first got permission to put the entire series over a public-address system in a local park. About 200 people attended. Several afterwards asked to hear the lecture again in their homes, and the manager of the local Talkie Theater asked for certain discs to be played during the intervals whilst he was showing the “Nazi Spy” film. Many books were placed as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been some further dividing work amongst the Indians who claim to be &quot;in the truth”. In Bangalore there were some who claimed to be devoted to Jehovah but who, as evidenced by their action, are still religionists and have withdrawn themselves from the activities of The Theocracy. Some have yet to learn that a mere knowledge of the fact that man has not an immortal soul, or that the “trinity” is a false doctrine, does not put one under the protection of The Theocracy, nor does partaking of the Memorial emblems put one into '<sup>1</sup> the body of Christ ’ ’. Without a clear vision of The Theocracy these rehgiomsts become offended against the Lord and think they have been wronged by those who are diligently serving the Lord. In spite of this falling away there are more publishers for The Theocracy in India at the end of 1940 than there were at the beginning; for which we give praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twenty-three pioneers placed 62 percent of the total literature. The figures show that the pioneers are about three times as efficient as the company pubhshers. It is a great privilege to be a pioneer, and some have grasped this privilege. Four entered the ra</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nks</span><span class="font5"> during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special magazine work announced in the spring of the year was organized and good work has been done, but this special activity has been hindered by reason of delays and irregularity in the receipt of the magazines through the mail. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> was stopped entirely, and it was some months before we could get sufficient supplies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> so as to give the field publishers an adequate supply of distributors’ copies. Though we have not missed any numbers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> there have been long intervals between receipt of copies, making it difficult to maintain regularity in the woik. In spite of this the number of new subscriptions obtained is greater than for the previous year, whilst single copies distributed increased from 863 in 1939 to 2,537 this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Vernacular Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Literature in the vernacular still remains our greatest need. We cannot supply all that is asked for. It is expensive to produce, and it is difficult to recover the money spent, because of the poverty of the people. Out of a total of 101,253 booklets placed, over 63,000 of them were in vernacular languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year we had matrices for the Tamil edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> made in India. These were sent to the Brooklyn factory and printed. This is by far the best vernacular publication we have ever had in India, and we look forward to a successful campaign amongst the Tamil-speaking people during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year we published 60,000 booklets in seven different languages, besides the Tamil </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> printed at Brooklyn. We have supplied an aggregate of 21,773 booklets to foreign branches, chiefly for the Indian work in Burma, the Malay States and Fiji. As stated m previous reports, this vernacular work is a financial burden on the Society. We are grateful to the Lord for being able to do so much, but there is much scope for more. Each language uses a different script, and this makes it very difficult for us to attempt the running of our own printing plant. We would like to be able to have our own press, but so far this has not been practicable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ceylon</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The above figures and report do not include Ceylon. Ceylon is an island under an entirely separate government from that of India, and there are numerous obstacles in the way of free intercourse. During the past ten years several pioneers have visited the island and a good witness has been given. Just when the work was expected to be consolidated the pioneer in charge of the work fell ill and has never recovered sufficiently to continue the work. Since then our pioneer ranks m India became depleted through deaths, and it has not been found convenient to send more pioneers across to Ceylon. We are now in better position, however, and arrangements are now being made to get a pioneer across. Unfortunately the war is now responsible for further obstacles to the movement of our English pioneers. An effort will be made, however, to overcome these difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Ceylon during the year has not progressed. One lone company publisher has been consistently active throughout the year, but has only a limited opportunity. Some others have made a profession of being on the side of The Theocracy; but very spasmodic reports, or none at all, indicate a lack of vision and appreciation. Theie are some 5J million people in Ceylon. The European community is chiefly scattered m the Tea and other estates over the country. Pioneers capable of maintaining motor vehicles are needed to reach these, whilst the native population is mostly Buddhist and exceedingly antagonistic towards the message of The Theocracy, or anything associated with the name of Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Religious and political influence combined has affected the witness work in Jamaica. Prohibition to distribute the books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Light</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study </span><span class="font5">No. 2 was issued by the government, and this has affected the work in general because the people are intimidated and made to believe that all the books of Watchtower publication are prohibited. However, the brethren continue to push forward in their work, doing the best they can to further the Kingdom interests. The total distribution of literature for the year has been, to wit, 63,660, with a total of 776 publishers in the field. In addition to this, however, a campaign has been carried on with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">which has given a splendid witness to the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The “strange work” of the Lord in which his witnesses have participated in Mexico has made some progress there during the fiscal year. More hours have been employed in the field and a greater effort put forth to give the testimony, and this in the face of adverse conditions. The total distribution of books and booklets during the year was 479,418.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font5"> were put out to the amount of 39,000, including those sent to foreign lands. Total letters sent out, 6,267; circulars and small packages, 12,814; cartons and large packages, 5,210.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The office prepared copy for 12 numbers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation;</span><span class="font5"> and the books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> were translated; also booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cause of Death, Favored People, Government and Peace, Refugees, Pudge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column, Conspiracy Against Democracy,</span><span class="font5"> some of which are already in circulation and others are eagerly awaited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Regions and Zones</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to new Organization Instructions, the country is divided into 4 regions and 50 zones, having for this service 2 regional servants and 26 zone servants. Zone meetings were held regularly all over the Republic with fair attendances and profitable and encouraging results. Miles traveled were 46,046.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have four sound-ears in service and two awaiting sound equipment and under repair. There were 91 phonographs put into the hands of the friends, making a total of 258 in use. We put out 1,525 records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though rather late in starting this activity, we have tackled with zest. As a result, at this writing we are out of magazines even though we have increased our order to Brooklyn, twice. We have our cloth bags made, and some paper ones for those that cannot afford the others to start. We are very hopeful of this work and undoubtedly will increase back-calls and number of workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were glad to partake in the special periods of the fiscal year. The names for them were very suggestive and timely, furnishing a lot of enthusiasm to faithful workers. The results were gratifying, especially the ones for the three-month </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign, which yielded the following results: Total books placed, 15,105; total booklets, 110,812; highest number of pioneers, 108; highest number of company publishers, 590; total hours in service, 104,626; total subscriptions, 1,421; total magazines distributed, 4,500; total sound attendance, 135,391; total back-calls, 6,600. These results for three months are larger than the whole of 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Water Immersion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As customary, we did not keep track of the number of friends symbolizing their consecration (that is, we do not keep a record of names). Approximately, the number was 200. One occasion was particularly noteworthy, and that was after an attack by a demonized mob against 120 witnesses at a zone meeting. After several of them had been stoned and some were bleeding, they regathered at about four miles from that place and 75 of them symbolized their consecration by water immersion. Surely, persecution does not discourage Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Printing Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been a source of economy and satisfaction to have our own printing press. It is in constant use, and we hope to put it still busier with the “Message of Hope” released at the first Theocratic convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Guatemala</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This country is under the supervision of this branch. The work is just starting to get going, and hope to keep the friends there busier this new fiscal year. There are many handicaps, but therein is where Jehovah’s witnesses have their greater joy and fun. The Lord is our strength, and through him we are overeomers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>NORTHERN EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Our American brethren can begin to appreciate some of the difficulties encountered by the Lord’s servants in Europe. For instance, the mails from Scandinavia must go through Russia and around the earth and into the west part of the United States, and the mail is very irregular. The Nazis are in possession of all the Scandinavian countries aside trom Sweden and Finland and retard the work very much. In the face of all this, in those northern European countries the output of books and booklets for 1940 is 2,700,000. Those devoted to the Lord will note with keen interest what our dear brother who is in charge of the northern European work was able to get through the mail, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once more it is my happy privilege to send you a brief report-concerning the work of The Theocracy in Northern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord has blessed the efforts of his people as is shown by the fact that 1,000 Jonadabs have climbed into Jehu’s chariot. Of course, there have been difficulties here and there, as the pages of the world press have revealed, but it is remarkable how the interest of the people in war-harried countries like Norway and Finland has been deepened so that far more literature has been spread than could have been expected. For example, at the end of June 174,737 bound books had been placed in Northern Europe, whereas in the whole of last year 129,162 were spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To 30th June 2,259,601 books and booklets were placed, to compare with 2,251,998 at June last year, and, taking into consideration reports received and estimating where not received, the eleven months to 31st August, 1940, will give us a grand total for eleven months of 2,700,000, with well over 210,000 books, as against 2,617,242 for all last year. The highest number out was in June, when 4,093 took part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have over 10,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscribers and over 80,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> and, as will be seen by the reports for the various countries, gramophone work, back-call work and model-study work have all been stressed. For example, at 30th June 284,248 gramophone lectures had been given, to 441,359 persons, so that at 31st August we must have exceeded last year’s results. Of course, much yet remains to be done. In June we had 1,370 gramophones in use, but we have about double that number in Northern Europe. We are striving to regularly use more hours for (a) first calls, (b) back-calls, (c) gramophone work, and (d) model studies, for it is thus we come in touch with those who are hungering and tliirsting for the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the end of June over 6,000 meetings for the interested had been held, with an attendance of 68,753.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The three Baltic States have now become Soviet republics, but it is yet too early to say whether we shall be allowed to carry on our work there. In letters to the Branch servants we have stressed that religion is of the Devil and Christianity is the exact opposite of religion. We hope to be able to continue, for, in Estonia alone, over 45,000 books had been spiead to the end of July. If it be the Lord’s will, we shall stay put and let the message go farther there. It is almost impossible for Englishmen to leave these countries unless they happen to be millionaires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How glad we are that soon the knowledge of the glory of God will fill the whole earth as the waters cover the great deep!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By reason of the postal delays we send you the year’s report to the end of August on this occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The average weekly number out m the field was 772, and the monthly was 1,270, which is a considerable increase on last year. Theie were used 185,230 hours, and 845,251 books and booklets were placed. The increase in bound books from 18,770 to 38,978 was very encouraging. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> m Denmark has increased from 2,400 to 2,653, and during the eleven months 283 came forward and symbolized their consecration to do God’s will. It is grand to see the fulfillment of Revelation VII as to the “great multitude”, and when they come along they want to Tower. We give thanks to Jehovah for all the help and encouragement we receive in its pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the first half-year many public meetings were held, with an attendance of 15,621 strangers and 3,175 books, etc., spread. In February a bishop talking over the radio poohpoohed the proclamation of Jehovah’s witnesses that we are living in “the last days”, and so in March a large public meeting was held in Copenhagen, at which 1,500 were present and some 250 couldn’t get in. There a Scriptural reply was given to this blind leader of the blind, for we could not get permission to reply over the radio. Additionally, the reply was printed m </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We continue to require a 21,000 edition of this paper, and occasionally a larger number is taken of particular issues. Including single copies and subscriptions, 270,000 copies were placed among the people, more and more of whom aie appreciating that religion is a snare of the Devil and has nothing to do with Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Model Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the period under review 30,631 back-calls were made, while 1,263 model studies were held, with an attendance of 3,616. Without a doubt this corresponds to the hand of Jehu held out to welcome Jonadab into the chariot. It is a delight to see how Jehovah guides his organization and gives them the joy of fulfilling the prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the period 25 conventions were held, with an attendance of 3,619 The largest was, of course, that held in Copenhagen in August, when 942 were present and 150 symbolized their conseciation. All the brethren felt it was a singularly blessed time and were much encouraged by your messages of love and encouragement. Surely, as you say, Armageddon must be “imminent”. At all events, the Devil is very angry because the Lord is blessing the proclamation of the Kingdom message, and he knows his time is short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Gramophone Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Until the end of August a further 244 gramophones were sent out; so at that date we had 837 m use; and 69,156 lectures were given, to 70,473 hearers. As it is written in Joel, “they shall enter m at the windows like a thief”; but the message also goes out therefrom, as witness the following testimony from a letter recently received at the office: “One of our brethren was out with the gramophone the other day on back-call work and played a couple of lectures. The man of the house heard them with the greatest interest and desired to take three bound books. As they talked about them, came a knock at the door, and when it was opened a lady stood outside. She told that she had been in the yard and heard the lectures and begged that they might be played again, as they weie the best she had ever listened to. So the records were put on again, and in the result the lady ordered a whole set of the bound books. Gramophones to the fore I ’ ’ Thus on this one back-call eighteen books were placed with two people. As our numbers increase we steadily receive more orders for gramophones, and we thank the Lord for this wonderful help He has given to us m our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I cannot close this brief report without rendering thanks to Jehovah for his providence and protecting care during this period in which we have had full freedom to proclaim the King and the Kingdom as the only hope for distressed humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bethel family join me m sending you our warmest love and greetings and in praying Jehovah’s continued blessing and guidance upon all your labors for Hun and his people. “This God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In giving a report on Scandinavia this office would be glad to give further information, but some of it is not given, in order to protect our brethren there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Nazis are in charge and doubtless would make trouble for them. At any rate, let the brethren in America rejoice in the fact that our brethren working under a handicap in Scandinavia are putting forth their very best endeavors to give a witness to The Theocracy and the Lord is blessing their efforts. The reports from the Northern European office, including the countries of Finland, Sweden, Denmark and the Baltic states, have had to come through Stockholm, Sweden. It is hard to get the reports in the order in which they usually appear, but in order that the Lord’s people may get some idea of what is going on in those countries under great handicaps, we insert most of the reports as made from the Scandinavian and Baltic countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTONIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font5">Estonia is now territory claimed by the Russian government, and further witnessing to the truth is very difficult. Because of the conditions there during the year there has been a great handicap to the work being done, but, in spite of all this, the distribution for 1940 has exceeded that of 1939. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people is 49,734. There were 43 publishers in the field, working 16,913 hours. Twenty new subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> were taken and 2,004 additional magazines were distributed. Concerning the conditions there the Society’s local servant reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As was to be expected, there has been an increase in the Kingdom interests and activities in Estonia during the year just ended. The report submitted covers only eleven months, but yet the figures show that more books have been spread this year than weie spread throughout the previous year. Various difficulties and hindrances have prevented the brethren from doing as much as they would have liked to advance the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom interests. Nevertheless, they are full of joy that the Lord has so richly blessed their united effoits to serve The Theocracy. Here are evidences enough to prove that the Lord is dividing the people and that the time rapidly approaches when they shall know that Jehovah is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year-period a total of 59,776 books and booklets were sent out from the depot. This is 15,588 more than went out during the preceding year. The number of publishers has increased by seven, there being now 43 who report. This, to some extent, accounts for the increased number of books distributed, but the chief reason therefor is that many people are seeing that soon they may not be able to obtain any Bible helps or even the Bible itself. In these last two months the number of big books placed has become nearly as many as the total number placed during all of the preceding nine months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is reported that all religious literature is being gathered away from public libraries, schools and bookshops and other distributors of “worthless literature”. The report includes the Bible among the books to be withdrawn from circulation. No longer does ‘ ‘ religious instruction ’ ’ appear in the school curriculum; and at the Tartu university the faculty of Theology will be dissolved. Churches are permitted, so far, to continue to practice their form of demonism. No longer may they make use of the radio. Only civil registration of births, marriages and deaths is now recognized by the State. Formerly it was an “ofiense” to speak the truth concerning the clergy or to expose their hypocrisy, but now, according to the Constitution, all citizens have freedom to carry on agitation against the churches and religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Estonia pioneers spread about ninety percent of all the literature containing the Kingdom message. There have been 15 pioneers in the work during the year. In 13,875 hours an average of ten of them spread 40,357 books and booklets. They made 238 back-calls and placed 89 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and 70 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> Since June last two pioneers, who are foreigners to Estonia, have done no regular witnessing, owing to their not having been granted permits to work. Fortunately one is able to take the place of a sister, who can serve as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So far it has not been possible to organize any companies, because the brethren are scattered here and there throughout the country. Besides the pioneers there are 28 brethren who have at some time reported activity, and of these an average of 17 spread 9,201 books and booklets, besides 33 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and 32 numbers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> They made 103 back-calls and worked 3,038 hours. A few persons, manifesting interest, have come or written to the depot, and to such 114 books and 62 booklets, 169 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and 22 of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> have been distributed. For the period ending 31st August a grand total of 5,733 books and 44,001 booklets have been distributed, in 16,913 hours. The total number of back-calls made was 341, and 1,530 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and 474 of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> were spread and 650 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informants </span><span class="font5">were sent out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Study meetings to the number of 103, with a total attendance of 818, have been conducted. In thia way a few brethren have been'helped to a better understanding of the Word of God and of their responsibility. At the Memorial season a convention was held, attended by 37 brethren Thirty-two took part in the service, and in six hours they spread 640 books and booklets. Twenty-one brethren partook of the emblems, while many Jonadabs were also present, eleven of whom were immersed. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles “The Theocracy’’, “Neutrality,” ‘‘ Snares, ’ ’ and ‘' Doom of Religion ’ ’ were discussed with great profit to all present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As this report is being prepared the information comes to hand that one who is a schoolteacher may not continue m Ins post and at the same time distribute literature containing the Kingdom message, which message exposes rehgion. The reason given for this regulation is that it is against the views of the Communist Party for a teacher to be so engaged. A brother has just been informed of this rule by the director of the school in which he is a teacher. In an interview with the school director the brother asked if a schoolteacher may attend church, and was given an affirmative answer. He further asked why he might not worship God as his conscience dictates, and as no answer to that question seems to have been given, he went on to show to the school director the difference between the teachings of the churches, which practice religion, and those of the Bible. Having done so, the brother added that he had no alternative and must leave his post as teacher, whereupon the school director said that he did not want to let the brother resign, because he is a good teacher and takes much pains with the pupils. He asked for one of the books and was given a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Home and Happiness.</span><span class="font5"> A day or two later the brother was informed that at present it is not permitted for a teacher to have anything to do with the Bible, except to inculcate hatred towards it and its teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not necessary to write to you concerning events that have transpired here within the past few weeks, more than to say that this country is now a member state of the Soviet Union This means that many changes m every direction are to be expected, and the effects of some of these are already being felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this brief report on the Kingdom interests in Estonia 1 send the love of the brethren here.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year, as the public press has duly informed the people, Finland has suffered greatly at the hands of the invading Russians and the food supply has been greatly reduced and the people have to endure many hardships, but in the face of all this difficulty it is gratifying to note the following output of literature ■ Books and booklets to the number of 427,008. 822 publishers in the field worked 131,242 hours. In addition to the books and booklets, 68,395 magazines were placed. The sound attendance of those who listened to the reproductions of the electrically transcribed speeches was 160,819 people. Back-calls were made to the number of 19,596 From the report of the Society’s servant the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is indeed with deep gratitude that I send you tins report of the Kingdom work in Finland and of some experiences connected with it during the past fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the year before had been the best until then, we had the joy of starting the year with still better results than those for the corresponding periods in the previous year, and everything had a most prosperous aspect. Later, however, we began to feel the influence of the war in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many years we have publicly stated that the war gives the Devil a good opportunity to try to hinder the work of spreading the truth, which was so well seen during the last world war, and that we must expect him again to use war in his effort to stop the work God’s people are now doing all over the world. Our turn now arrived to experience this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the 30th November our neighbors the Russians, without proclaiming war, suddenly flew to Helsinki and, using clouds to protect themselves, commenced dropping bombs on defenseless and innocent people, and then war broke out in all its fury. This gave the conservative elements, especially the cleigy, a long-awaited oppoitunity to do their utmost to stop the Kingdom work m our eountiy. First of all, our brethren came under special tests in connection with military service, and this gave them a good opportunity to give fine testimonies before the authorities, among whom were always some clergymen. Their experiences proved that the worldly authorities generally show a reasonable understanding, many times speaking m our favor, but the clergy tried to cause all kinds of difficulties, which in some eases resulted quite senously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next step was an attack against our literature. We had just succeeded in getting the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace </span><span class="font5">from Switzerland and were distributing it with great joy, when it was suddenly confiscated. Fortunately the greater part of the consignment had alieady been sent out. Following thia the censor made it impossible for our magazines to appear, even forbidding the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> and, as all letters were censored, we could not even use the mail to send general information. The censorship was also extended to telegrams and telephone con-veisations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to make it still more difficult for us to work, a court case was brought against the incorporated Finnish Society with the intention of completely stopping our work. At the same time it became impossible to send our packages of literature either by rail or by post. The majority of the brothers at the office were taken away, and seven of the nine zone servants had also to leave their jobs. A large number of the friends had to move from their homes to “somewhere”. All this occurred just at the time for the renewal of subscriptions for our magazines for the new year. Then we received further news that time after time our other books were being confiscated, as well as gramophone records. When we tried to work m spite of these difficulties we were again and again interrupted by air-raid alarms. Friends who desired to obtain books had to travel by tram to do so. But what traveling! A brother came from one of the larger cities, usually three hours distant from Helsinki. On this occasion the journey took 24 hours, as there were so many alarms, and as he had to carry the books a long way owing to the fact that the rails had been tom up by bomb explosions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under all these exceedingly trying circumstances the Lord has very graciously and marvelously protected his people and helped them. A brother who was arrested and from whom both gramophone and records were taken by the activity of a pastor was taken before a court-martial to be exammed. He asked that he might be permitted to take the gramophone and records with him, so that the judges might hear what he was telling the people, but the police refused to grant his request. As soon as he came before the court the chairman desired to hear the records, and so, to the brother’s great joy, the court and many other people listened. All thought that he would be sentenced, but the judges were reasonable and stated that the records contained nothing that had been detrimental to the government, and he was acquitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During these very hard times we arranged several gatherings to encourage the friends, and also went out with the books, although most homes were empty, as their owners had fled. We also had the joy of seeing several new ones symbolize by water i</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">ersion their consecration to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The court case against our Finnish Society (Vartiotornin Raamattu ja Traktaattiseura, r.y.) lasted several months. The accusation was that the activities of the Society might be considered to be not only disturbing to the defense of the State, but also against good order, and even against the law, and also that the Society not only functioned without approving religion, but even in many cases scoffed at it, and in this way acted against the law as set forth in the Criminal Code, Chapter 10, Sections 1 and 2. Continuing, the accusation stated that the Society permitted its members to obey the laws of the country only so far as the laws happened not to be in contradiction to the Bible. Further, members were not permitted to fight against the enemies of the State and so were not permitted to comply with the conscription law and orders issued under martial law. They also did not acknowledge the idea of a fatherland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the prosecution tried to find false witnesses, they were not able to prove their accusations. On the contrary, their witnesses testified for us; one of them, brought at great expense from a far-away city, stating, among other things, that Judge Rutherford was the only man now on earth able to correctly explain the Bible. During the trial we had many good opportunities to give clear testimonies for the truth. Of course, the opposition, tried to catch us with words, as the scribes and Pharisees did with Jesus. We prayed and looked to the Lord for guidance and help, knowing very well that we in ourselves were too weak to stand against our enemies, who were seeking only to harm us. The Lord permitted the enemy to go as far as he could, and finally, after several months, a decision was pronounced. It was not based upon the accusations made, but on other statements which were neither considered during the trial nor proved to be true. The sentence was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘The incorporated Society, by the literature spread and the lectures held, has explained that it itself represents true Christianity, and in this way has glaringly characterized as its contrast the religions of the religious bodies acknowledged by the State and that, as a result of this perverted viewpoint, and using peculiar methods to explain the Bible, the Society has by its teachings caused, and is still causing, harmful disturbance to views which have been and must be held holy in our country. For this reason, as the Society is functioning in this way against good order, the court proclaims that the said Society shall be dissolved and immediately cease its work, and decides that Judge Bo Therman shall take the property of the Society under his supervision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We immediately appealed to a higher court, showing how inconsistent the judgment had been. The chief points in our appeal were:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. As the law regarding religious freedom grants to every citizen in Finland the right to serve God according to the dictates of his conscience, the decision of the court is in direct contradiction to that law, as the aforementioned decision tries to hinder a section of the Finnish people from serving God according to their convictions. At the same time an attempt has been made to deprive honest Christians of the means for carrying on their work, which means they have by great sacrifice and with the help of fellow believers in other countries procured.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. The public prosecutor has made statements which he has not even attempted to prove. Special mention can be made here of his unfounded charge that the Society has broken the Criminal Law, Chapter 10, Section 1, which concerns the blasphemy</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">of God in public. This is one of the most unscrupulous statements that could be made, as the whole activity of the Society has been focused on the honoring of God, which same can be said of the members and supporters of the Society.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">3. The decision to dissolve the Society has been based upon the assumption that the literature spread and lectures held under the auspices of the Society “has explained that [the Society] itself represents true Christianity and in this way has glaringly characterized as its contrast the religions of religious bodies acknowledged by the State’’. From the prosecutor’s side no attempt has even been made to prove that the Society, from the Bible viewpoint alone, does not represent true Christianity. On the contrary, from the side of the defendants this point has been definitely proved by an immense volume of evidence. The court m this way has based its decision on statements, to prove the truth of wmeh was not even attempted. That the various religions are in contradiction to real Christianity is in no way the fault of the Society, as Jesus already proved when, speaking to the religionists of his day he said: “Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered. ’ ’—Mark 7: 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. The decision to dissolve the Society was further based on the statement that the Society had a “perverted viewpoint”, although this charge was not even mentioned during the several months which the case lasted. Still less was any attempt made to prove it. The Society, which has the whole time sincerely worked for the good of its neighbors, has never had a “perverted viewpoint”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. As a further basis for the decision the statement was made that the Society used “peculiar methods to explain the Bible ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ has by its teachings caused and is still causing harmful disturbance to views which have been and must be held holy m our country”. These reasons are also entirely based upon air, as from the prosecutor’s side the matters were not proved nor even stated. The “peculiar” manner in which the Society was alleged to explain the Bible was not shown, neither was it stated what were the views “which have been and must be held holy”, nor how a harmful disturbance of these views had been caused.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">6. As the authorities had refused time and again to permit the founder, and for many years chairman, of the Society, Mr. W. Dey, a British subject, to travel to Finland in order to superintend the affairs of the Society, notwithstanding the appeals and petitions made, in some instances to the Ministry, and notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Dey had full right to thus superintend such affairs on account of the foreign credit of 2,000,000 F</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inni</span><span class="font5">sh Marks given to the Society with the understanding that Mr. Dey would have such rights, the other four members of the Society did not think it possible for the Society to continue its activities, wherefore it was decided to dissolve the Society on the 13th April of this year, which decision, with the name of the legal executor appointed, was, according to the Law of Associations, immediately co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmu</span><span class="font5">nicated to the Registry officials. Before that the Society, in harmony with the law, sold its property and, with the money thus received, discharged its debts. Thus the Society, on finishing its activities, had no property 01 possessions. The notice of the dissolving of the Society and the legal diary extract taken from the Register of Associations was presented to the court at its session on the 7 th May. Notwithstanding this, three weeks later the court, at its session on May 28, decided that the already legally dissolved Society should be liquidated and even authorized an executor for the non-existing property, although the Law regarding Associations, Section 22, clearly states that, if an Association “dissolves itself, its board should be the executors if the Association has not authorized one or more executors ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7.</span><span class="font5"> Other officials have used this unjust and groundless court case in order to cause damage to the Society amounting to several hundred thousands of Marks at a time when conditions generally were very difficult.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">As the court case was proceeding we endeavored several times by personal applications and petitions to get permission for Brother Dey to visit us, that we might benefit by his advice. Brother Dey was one of the founders of our incorporated Society and was for many years its chairman. The Society was established in this manner in the year 1933. Brother Dey also tried from his end to obtain permission to visit Finland, but all our efforts were of no avail. When we tried to find who was responsible for the opposition we were simply informed that it was “great” men in honored and influential positions. Yet twice we received the answer that the clergy were responsible. Of course, we knew that before we were told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Germans took Denmark all communication with Brother Dey was broken for a time and we had to decide ourselves what to do. We depended upon the Lord to guide us in our great difficulties, and this he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We examined the matter very carefully and decided to make a new arrangement. We formed a new joint stock company called Kustannusosakeyhtio Vartiotorni (Watchtower Publishing Company), and our former incorporated Society sold all its possessions to the new company and dissolved itself more than a month before the judges decided that it should be so dissolved. So really the Society did not exist at all when the authorities decided to dissolve it. We feel sure that the Lord guided us in our decision to form the new company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the sentence of the court was pronounced, the authorities tried to confiscate our building, but, as it was sold, they were not able to do so. Now they are trying to harm us as much as possible in order to force us to give up the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our enemies also set a man to watch what we were doing. Both our enemies and many of our friends thought that the Kingdom work m Finland was fully stopped. But it is not the work of man; it is the work of Jehovah, and he lets us see how, by his mighty hand, he can direct his work whatever his enemies may do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long before we decided to dissolve the incorporated Society a new association with the name “Publishers of The Theocracy ’ ’ had been formed and meetings were held under its supervision. When, the day following the decision of the court, we came to our usual meeting, the above-mentioned watchman came also and was met by one of the brethren acting as janitor. The man asked: “What Kingdom hall is this?” The j’amtor answered: “Don’t you know? The Publishers of The Theocracy have their meetings here ’ ’ The man answered: “ Oh I I thought it was the Watchtower people who had their meetings here,’’ and went his way. Under the Lord’s protection we have been able to continually hold regular meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of our most zealous brothers is almost completely blind. He has been very keen to arrange sound meetings. Many successful trips were made with our motorear, under his direction; but when the war broke out we were not permitted to obtain gasoline, and so we have not been able to use our car. But the brother found another means of getting on with the woik He bought a tandem bicycle and arranged with two other brothers to assist him One guided the tandem with the blind brother behind and the other pedaled a tricycle carrying the sound-machine and loud-speaker. The distances covered were considerable and all the main towns were visited. In order to advertise the lectures friends from the companies went on the streets using megaphones made of cardboard to cry out invitations to the people. The results were really wonderful. Thousands and thousands came to the meetings, which were held in the most central open places in the towns. The enemy was perplexed. In some places meetings were dissolved and our brethren arrested, but, nevertheless, the result was very wonderful and a mighty witness was given. The trip ended in Tampere, one of our largest cities, where we had arranged a convention two weeks before our annual gathering in Helsinki. There we met with great opposition. As we went to our convention hall, where we have held meetings for many years, we were met by policemen who prevented us from entering and even caused the friends who intended to attend to be scattered. Yet we succeeded to gather the friends and 113 went out with the books. It pleased the Lord to bless our efforts, and m a short time over 4,800 were spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year it was intended to hold the International Olympic Games in Finland, and for that reason a great stadium was built with seating capacity for 60,000. The outbreak of war stopped the holding of the games and so the big construction seemed to be useless. It came to our minds to try to use it for a public meeting. Our brethren were successful in their efforts, and the great building was hired for a very reasonable price ($100), which sum was paid over. (This money was afterwards returned.) After our severe experiences in Tampere we just wondered how it would go with our annual convention and with the big meeting. Many friends were dismayed and thought it might easily result in the complete stoppage of the work. Yet a few had courage to continue with the preparations. Seventyeight thousand copies of an attractive folder, mentioning the chief points of the proposed lecture and containing a good advertisement of our literature, were printed and distributed. This meant a copy for every home in Helsinki. We thought that if nothing more could be done a good witness would be given and our work during the convention would be helped, especially as we were hoping to receive the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation. </span><span class="font5">Permission to take the books from the customs authorities had been received, but the clergy had in some peculiar way got to know that the book had arrived, and made such a noise that the authorities refused to let us have the books. The day previous to that fixed for the big meeting some of our brethren went to the police office in order to arrange for help at the meeting. The chief of police asked at once: “Is Harteva not already finished with? How can he speak at such a meeting?” Our brethren then had a good opportunity to give a fine testimony before him and also before the Minister of the Interior. They decided to further consider the matter, but, evidently pressed by the clergy and Nazis, ultimately decided that the meeting could not be held owing to the critical times, and that we should advertise the public to that effect. We understood that they had decided to prevent the holding of the meeting by force, and so put an advertisement in the most important newspapers explaining the matter and also giving the chief points from the leaflet we had spread. So the whole matter was known throughout the length and breadth of Finland. The newspapers at first refused to take our advertisement, as they explained that our work was a continuation of the dissolved Society, which was forbidden according to the law, but as the authorities had expressed their desire that we should put an advertisement in the papers, they finally accepted the advertisement. So a further good witness was given; but the Lord had still greater things for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We started with our convention, and at the appointed time the lecture was held in the convention hall. After the meeting the offices of our biggest newspapers were visited and a miracle happened. Although other newspapers definitely refused, the biggest newspaper printed the whole of the lecture, which covered about one and one-third of its big pages. When the chief editor was approached regarding this, he said: “Why should we not print something about God’s Kingdom in our paper for once?’’ Afterwards one of our brothers remarked: &quot;It was at that point that the angel of the Lord pressed a button in his brain. ’ ’ When the friends the following morning saw the whole lecture in this, the most prominent newspaper in our country, they could hardly believe their eyes, and in their astonishment they burst into great joy and praise to the Most High who had thus blessed our efforts. It is estimated that the readers of that paper total about half a million. After this other newspapers, following the example of this leading newspaper, desired also to publish the lecture, and an agreement was made with some of them. The total number of people who likely read the lecture was estimated at over a million. If we estimate the total of those who have heard our lectures during the 30 years we have worked in Finland, we would not reach such a figure, which is slightly less than a third of the population of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is most marvelous to see how the Lord is guiding and protecting his people under all circumstances. That does not mean that he will not permit his little ones to suffer for righteousness’ sake, because that gives them an opportunity to show their integrity under severe testings. During the year there have been many such -experiences. Not only have our brothers been cast into piison, and one of the most zealous pioneer sisters, too, but they have also been ill-treated. One brother, for instance, was taken to the police office for examination, but instead of being-questioned he was so ill-treated that blood ran from his mouth and nose, and even his eardrums were broken. Then he was forced to clean the blood from the floor with the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font5"> Some have been east into a dark pit where the ground was so wet that it was impossible to lie down. Not only books, gramophones and records have been taken from the brethren, but even Bibles also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been apparent that the highly honored clergy, together with other religionists and Nazis, have been behind all this persecution. As you will understand, after the arrangements for and publication of the lecture the howl in the enemy’s camp was very great. The topic for the lecture was &quot;The Kingdom Which Cannot Be Moved’’, and the Nazi newspapers especially wrote many malicious articles against us and against me particularly; but in connection with this a remarkable thing happened. In one of the articles a considerable part of the lecture, containing the warning and showing the only way to escape before Armageddon, was published, showing how all those belonging to the &quot;goat’’ class will perish while the &quot;sheep’’ will be protected. Of course, the article mocked and promised a better kingdom, where even the goats would have a good time. In another newspaper it was stated that it was a pity that we were not permitted to hold the lecture, as they would then have had an opportunity of counting &quot;all the wash-proof Jews” (i.e., Jews whose identity could not be hidden) at the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a great howling and gnashing of teeth in the enemy’s eamp. In the lecture we had referred to the words of Jesus, who foretold just such a time and stated that it would be proof that we were very near the day when the new princes would be here to rule the new righteous world, and when all opposers of The Theocracy would be swept away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for several months the censor had prevented the publication of the Finnish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World (Consolation), two</span><span class="font5"> new magazines, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font5">were started. They each have their own editors, and we hope that they will carry knowledge and consolation for all those in our country who love righteousness and who desire to be fully consecrated to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although for so many months it has been difficult to engage in the service work, and although many of our publishers have not been able to participate in it, the results for the whole year are very encouraging. A considerable amount of literature and records have been sent out of the office; viz., 105,930 books, 179,279 covered booklets and 694,825 self-covered booklets, 72 gramophones and 7,241 records. Reporting has also been difficult in many cases, as a good number of friends have had to leave their homes. However, the number of bound books reported spread shows a big increase over that for the previous year, although the figures for booklets have gone down, more especially as a result of the confiscation of the booklet previously mentioned. The number of books spread has increased from 27,187 to 45,774, and the booklet total decreased from 588,445 to 381,234, which, nevertheless, is a good total, all things considered. That the work for the &quot;great multitude’’ has been important is seen from the fact that the number of those who symbolized their consecration by water immersion was 292, to compare with 172 for the previous year. Although at present a good amount of work is being done, yet the signs increase to show that the time is drawing near when the work will finish. Officials have already openly stated to us that one church, that is, the State church, is sufficient. For this reason we watch with keen interest to see &quot;the sign’’, &quot;when they shall say ‘Peace and safety’.’’ But during the time we are watching we will surely do with our might what our hands find to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our printery has been a great help during the year. Although we were not able to do very much during the Russo-Finnish war, as almost the whole staff was taken away and we could not publish the magazines, yet since the new company was formed the machines have been running faster than ever before ; and although we were able to work for about eight months only, yet the work accomplished is not much less than that done during the whole of last year. The total has decreased from 876,608 to 756,173. As it is now quite impossible to obtain literature from other countries, we are very grateful to be able to do our own printing, and to our great joy we have been able also to do something for Sweden and Norway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pressure upon our office has sometimes been very great, yet by the Lord’s grace a good amount of work has been accomplished and it has pleased the Lord to bless our efforts in the service work. Our little staff of 17, from which about the half was taken away for longer or shorter periods, has had the joy of placing literature to the total of 17,269, of which 2,688 were bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The food question in our country is becoming more and more severe, and the winter may bring new and greater difficulties in many respects. Yet we are fully convinced that our dear Lord and King will graciously guide us and protect us, giving all the help we need in order that we may maintain our integrity to the glory of his holy name. We daily remember you, dear Brother Rutherford, in the wonderful work the Lord has given you, and we pray that he may strengthen you and guide you as we so rapidly near the great climax when Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole Bethel family, as well as all the friends in Finland, join in most hearty greetings and best wishes to* you.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>LITHUANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Although very little has been accomplished in Lithuania during the past year, much has happened to seriously affect the work there. As you are aware, a Polish refugee, claiming to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, with his wife and three children, was given food and shelter. When it became apparent that he was one who had left the Lord’s organization, he was with difficulty forced to leave. In his rage he went to one of the Jonadabs and endeavored to get into touch with others of the interested with the avowed purpose of causing discord. He made the statement that he would “sell his last shirt” to get me turned out of the country, and on another occasion approached the same Jonadab asking whether it would be best to report to the police, the clergy or the Society. He was again sent about his business, but it transpired that he had already made reports to all three. The direct result of this action was that a package of literature was held up and the office raided early one morning. At this time I was recovering from a very severe illness, and having to stand for three hours in a draughty corridor getting the literature in order caused a relapse. I was ordered to attend the police office, but was able to obtain a doctor’s certificate to the effect that I was unfit to leave the house. Nevertheless, the following day the police called and gave me a three hours’ gruelling examination whilst I was lying ill in bed, despite my request that the examination be postponed. Later I had to attend the police office on three occasions, when, during the course of examinations, filthy suggestions were made, which could have originated only in the mind of the Judas who was responsible for the trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some time no result of these examinations was forthcoming, and the traitor got busy sending anonymous letters to the chief of pohce and directors of Government departments, asking why I had not been deported. Finally word came that I was to be refused a renewal of my permit to reside in Lithuania. This decision was made without any kind of trial and without my having the least oppoitunity of defending myself. The reason for the refusal was not based on the filthy suggestions (actual charges were not made) referred to, but was merely that I had not kept my word, said to have been given seven years earher, that I would never spread the hterature. Needless.. to say, this was a further distortion of facts, and the authorities knew full well that during that time I had been engaged in the spreading of our hterature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of every effort, it was impossible to obtain a reversal of the decision Good contacts were made, but high officials in both the Inland and Foreign ministries stated that there was a power at work against which they could do nothing. 'This was not news to us, as we were not the only ones who knew that Lithuania was governed from the Vatican. Owing to the fact that I had protested against paying a sum demanded for seven years’ income tax, my visa enabling me to leave Lithuania was refused. The authorities therefore gave me a short extension of time, and before this had expired Norway became involved in hostihties and the way out of Lithuania was blocked. For this reason I apphed for and was granted further extensions, usually for one week or a fortnight, until the Minister of the Interior signed a notice that I was to leave within a month. Before that time expired both he and his chief of police were behind prison bars. The Soviet troops had arrived</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As there was the possibility that a kinder view would be taken of our activities, as soon as possible application was made for the return of the confiscated hterature; but it quickly became evident that the work of witnessing would be further hindered, and eventually I was informed that if I did not leave the country within a month, I would be taken over the border into Germany by force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At about this time all legations and consulates were under notice to close, so that not only would it then be impossible to apply for protection to the British Legation, but also there would be no opportunity of obtaining the necessary visas for entering other countries. I immediately sent you a cable in case you had instructions, but, although the money for this was taken by the postal authorities, it seems they never sent it. I also telegraphed to Stockholm m the hope that a visa would be obtained in order that I might enter Sweden, but this too was impossible. By the time the answer from Stockholm came through, all legations and consulates were officially closed; so it seemed absolutely impossible for me to leave the country. It was then that I was able to obtain, in what seemed to be little short of marvelous, visas for both Sweden and Finland, and that on the very last day in each ease. Then the way opened up for my fare to be paid for the whole journey to Stockholm, for my luggage to be sent at no cost to myself, and for the little money I had to be transferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the figures necessary for sending a detailed report were confiscated by the police; others had to be destroyed, and still others had to be packed in the luggage, which has not yet arrived. So, until I get word from the Northern European Office, it will be impossible to send a report of what has actually been accomplished and other matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are a few in Lithuania who will be able to continue to witness for a time, but for how long is a question. Some idea of the attitude of the Soviet authorities towards the proclamation of The Theocracy may be had from the following experience in Estoma. A teacher was told that he must either refrain from spreading the literature or resign. He chose the latter, but the commissar said that as he was such a good teacher they did not want to lose him, and asked to see one of the books. Later the brother was informed that teachers would be expected to teach the children to hate the Bible, and, of course, his resignation was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Memel territory had been occupied by Germany some months prior to the sending of last year’s report, and we have received little news from that quarter. It is certain, however, that many of the friends there are now in prison, some for telling others about The Theocratic Government, others for having the Society’s literature in their possession. It is rather remarkable that many who were weak physically have proved that they are strong spiritually, while others of better physique and enjoying good health have compromised in their attitude towards Jehovah and his King. One of the former, asked by the judge if he would refrain from speaking further about The Theocracy, said, “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,” and received a four years’ sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although service possibilities and general conditions of life in Lithuania have been very difficult during the past seven years especially, it was with a measure of sadness that I left behind those who, although they have not been able to obtain spiritual food in the measure their brethren in some other lands have enjoyed, have shown a determination to stand firm under trial</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Assuring you of my continued love and appreciation of the privilege of being associated with you in the glorious privilege of serving under the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">While Sweden has thus far escaped the actual warfare, the work in that land has been much disturbed and retarded by reason of the opposition put forth by the religionists. With all this handicap the good people of Sweden with good-will toward God have hastened to find out more about the Kingdom. During the year, for the first time, the distribution of literature passed the million mark. The total number of books and booklets distributed in eleven months was 1,005,882. The Society’s servant at Stockholm, Sweden, makes report of conditions and the work there, and the following is taken from said report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Owing to the very slow postal connections, this year’s annual report can comprise only eleven months, if it is to reach you in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I started last year’s report by stating that that year had been an eventful one. And certainly the one just past has had that characteristic even much more. Your words, in the letter sent to the publishers on January 20, about the importance of the year 1940, have certainly already become even more true than anyone could have thought at the time. That the Devil is making use of his &quot;short time” is evident to everybody who will see, and how happy are we that we are privileged to see also the Lord’s dealings in bringing matters to a final decision and bringing his own people into his place of security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the things that call forth special gratitude toward Jehovah when reviewing the happenings of the past year is the fact that we have been able to receive the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font5"> and other communications from Head Office, practically without interruption though somewhat delayed, and to continue giving the witness without those hindrances which have been so greatly felt in many other countries. It is true, of course, that, e.g., the lack of motor vehicles has been a hindrance in the work, but, on the other hand, by using push cycles the friends have been able to more thoroughly cover those parts of their territories they have been able to work, and all the small by-roads and paths have certainly never been so well gone over as during this past summer. So, although some parts of the country have been inaccessible for military reasons, the witness has been more widely given than heretofore. And many people who in the past did not take our message seriously are now admitting that they were mistaken and can now see that what we have been telling them is the tiuth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although this country has hitherto been keeping out of the war, a natural result of the hostilities in Europe has been increased military activity here, and this has had its effect upon the work of those pioneers and other male publishers of military age. Many others, however, have joined our ranks and joyfully carried the message to the people, and those called up have, in most eases, had very good opportunities to testify before their superiors and others to the highness and supremacy of Jehovah. In some cases arrests and imprisonment have followed, but through it all the testimony is being given and the brethren are joyful. Some cases are now pending decision by the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effects of the war were also making themselves felt here, already in the closing days of 1939, by the confiscation of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font5"> which was ordered because of some expressions found therein and considered to be libelous against the head of another nation. The result of this action was, however, that the friends put still more steam on in spreading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font5"> which booklet arrived here </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font5">ediately after this happening. In like manner the difficulties arising for the work in Finland, and subsequently in Norway, when the war swept those countries, caused the publishers here to get into the field in greater numbers and more regularly and to put in more hours than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The number of publishers has increased from 1,361 to 1,726, or by 365. The average number out in the field each month has been 1,471 (increase 359), and weekly average, 883 (increase 223). Twenty-two new companies have been organized, bringing the number up to 120, divided into seven zones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the publishers there were 118 pioneers (including six zone servants), which is an increase of 42 over last year. The average number reporting each month has been 88, or 29 more than last year. And their number is constantly being added to; about ten more are entering this service on the first of October. It is indeed a joy to see how the righteous requirements of Jehovah’s organization are thus being responded to, by young and older friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hours in the Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hours in the service went up from 226,163 to 303,172. Although each publisher has not reached the standard of 60 hours a month, yet the increase in hours of over 45 percent, compared with the increase in publishers of nearly 27 percent, shows that much more time has been put in. than last year by those who did work during that year also. And, since the use of motorcars, etc., has had to be dropped because of war restrictions, much time has actually been spent in the work without appearing in the reports, because the “way” to and from territories now often requires much more than one hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Model Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This important feature of the work shows an increase of 31,465 over last year, the total of back-calls made this year being 80,134. This, however, falls far short of the mark 12 a month per publisher, the average being only 5; but we continue to reach out for that mark and trust that the ensuing year will bring us even far beyond it. The model-study work has been much appreciated and has had good results in bringing people to realize their own position and responsibility in connection with the truth. Unfortunately, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study </span><span class="font5">booklet No. 1 has been out of stock for a while and No. 2 is not yet off the press. It is being printed at the plant in Helsingfors, and we are now expecting it early next month. When we get it, we are confident that this work will take on more impetus, and consequently the back-call work in general will improve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are now, roughly, 1,200 gramophones at disposal of the publishers in this country. During the year they have played the recorded lectures to 293,073 people. For a while there was a shortage of records threatening, but now we are again getting them made through the agency of the Danish branch. Importation of records is still allowed, though gramophones are prohibited, except upon license, which is only very seldom given, and the portable type which we need has had to be imported either from U.S.A, or from Switzerland, and commercial connections with both of these countries are now very limited, if at all possible. However, we desire to use the gramophones we have already got to the glory of Jehovah. An interesting item in connection with this work: Owing to the general nervousness after Norway had been dragged into the war, the local police told a pioneer sister she must not play the records within a certain jurisdiction. She informed the office, and the result was that two weeks later 39 locusts invaded the town with the gramophones and played the records to 395 people, who took over 400 copies of the books and booklets. Among the placements was also a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> taken by the chief of police!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Literature placed has now for the first time in this country passed the million mark, the total for the eleven months being 1,005,882. This figure is made up of 90/544 bound books (increase over last year—twelve months — 36,463) and 915,538 booklets (increase 99,467 over the twelve months of previous year). The arrival of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> was indeed a treat, as, because of the war, it first looked as if it would never reach us. A reprinted edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font5"> on the other hand, is still waiting at Berne for better times to come. Of the booklets, besides </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font5"> as ready mentioned, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font5"> has had an unprecedented distribution. The new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> is just received from Headquarters, and we have heard about the booklet to come with the recorded lectures given at Detroit, and, by the Lord’s grace, we hope that these will also be distributed in time in our language also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign in the spring resulted in 899 new subscriptions’ being taken, and at the end of August the subscription list showed a number of 4,733. We continue to push this magazine on all possible occasions, especially urging all the interested to become regular subscribers. Spreading of loose copies of this magazine has also become a regular feature of the work since some months back, and from this particular work we hope that more interest in the best magazine in the world will result. The Swedish edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font5">continues to go ahead. Last year, at the end of August, we had 36,755 on the list, and this year-the number was 47,710. As many subscribers abroad have not been able to keep up their subscription because of war conditions, the increase is practically all “domestic”. In the “route work” as well as directly from door to door there were placed loose copies to the number of 154,664, an increase on last year’s twelve months of 62,307.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The annual convention was held at the end of June, in Stockholm, and in spite of many obstacles to overcome in the way of traveling, money scarcity, etc., there were gathered even more friends than last year, when we had a banner attendance in this far-flung country, and sparsely populated at that. The number present this year was 685, 130 of whom symbolized their consecration. It was a most blessed occasion, everyone present being filled with joy and gratitude to Jehovah for the wonderful privilege that we were allowed to assemble in perfect peace and could go out to the people with the comforting message without any interruption or hindrance, while the world around us was filled with rage and fear and evil forebodings. In the course of the year 25 zone assemblies have been held, in different parts of the country, with a total attendance of 2,580. At these assemblies 327 symbolized, making the total of baptized ones 457, which is 214 more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the winter season of the year there were held 40 public meetings, with an attendance of 8,900. Of these meetings exactly half were held during the short interval between the height of the Russian-Finnish fight and the outbreak of war in Norway. At all of these latter meetings the topic “Government of Peace—■'When and how will it come? Why does God permit wickedness and bloodshed?” was discussed, and audiences of, in all, 7,195 persons heard the presentations with the most attentive interest ever noticed even in this country, where the people gathered for lectures have ever been very attentive. Quite a number of those who heard the Truth for the first time at one or other of these meetings are now regularly attending studies and going out with the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All in all, the past year has been one filled with exciting experiences and strenuous work, through all which the gracious Lord has granted strength and joy, 'daily carrying a load for us,’ as promised, and with the encouraging visions of the approaching victory and full establishment of the righteous government’s rule which have been given us through the unfolding of prophecy and fulfillment thereof. The constant stream of people of good-will who have come to seek refuge in the Theocratic organization and of those who have given their lives to be used in full-time service for this, the only cause worth while, has brought gladness to our hearts in a way and measure that cannot be stated. For this we render our heartfelt thanks to the Giver of every good and perfect gift. And with these thanks we also present the expressions of our gratitude to Him for the untiring service rendered his people and their work by you, dear Brother Rutherford, and we pray that his blessing and strength may continue to be your portion and that he may keep and shield you from the assaults of the vicious enemy, all to the glory of his own holy name. All the Bethel family join me in sending you our warmest love and greetmgs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">P.S. When concluding this letter a note comes in, which I would like to cite. It comes from a sister who has stood firm for the Truth during many years. Last autumn her husband died (he had the Truth in Brother Russell’s days, but then left it). It was my privilege to serve at his funeral, and now the sister writes: &quot;The anniversary of your service here has just passed. At that time all of my three daughters were strangers to the Kingdom work. And now, with this letter, the third one of them sends in her application for pioneer service. What more can I desire than that we all may continue steadfastly in the glorious service of The Theocracy to the end! ‘This is the Lord's doing. It is marvellous in my eyes. ’ We rejoice together m all the goodness and loving-kindness of Jehovah, praying for his guidance and blessing toward his own work throughout the earth.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There has been a steady increase in the proclamation of the gospel of the Kingdom throughout the Philippine Islands during the past year. More active workers have taken the field, and the interest has increased. At the same time the opposition from the religionists has greatly increased and wicked methods are used by the religionists to retard the work; but this of itself serves to divide the people into two classes, the “goats” manifesting themselves and the “sheep” taking their stand on the side of the Lord. The Philippine Islands long under the dominating control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the people have been kept in ignorance; but gradually the light of God’s kingdom is shining into the hearts and minds of the sincere ones, and these are taking their place on the side of The Theocracy. Says the local servant in his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The distribution of Kingdom literature for the year had a slight increase over that of the preceding year. While the increase was not as great as the preceding one, still we consider it a rich blessing from the great Giver of good, considering the increased oppositions from all quarters and the nature of most of the territories covered. A large group of our active pioneers were incarcerated by anarchistic public servants for almost a month for doing faithfully their divine commission of preaching The Theocracy. During the year remoter places never reached before were covered, including the semi-civilized. Igorots’ and Tinguians’ territories in the mountains or far into the wilderness. In those remote places most of the people are illiterate and very poor, and those that had been proselyted by those that “compass sea and land” for selfish gain, very fanatical. That also accounts for the decrease in the bound books placed and why most of the booklets distributed were the self-covered ones. The publishers of The Theocracy here placed in the hands of the people 14,068 bound books and 133,846 booklets; making a total of 147,914 pieces; and 3,121 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> They spent 96,584 hours in the field; obtained 154 new Subscriptions; had 59,259 sound attendance, and made 2,726 good-will back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Interesting and thrilling were the field experiences of the “locusts” during the past year. Pioneers, both male and female and old and young, often hiked 10 to 15 kilometers across valleys and over lulls and on mountainsides to reach their territories. The way became doubly difficult during rainy days (and we have a long season of torrential rains here), as the trails on the mountainsides become slippery and dangerous. The streams become swollen and the rice paddies flooded, and the brethren had to wade in the rushing waters or in the deep mud. Not seldom the soldiers of The Theocracy got marooned. Often they were caught by heavy downpours in the mountains and wide fields with no shelter to run to and got drenched to the skin. Book cases got soaked and were destroyed and the literature wet. Clothes got wet, and dry, on their bodies sometimes. Once a group marooned up in the mountains during a stormy weather were forced to sleep two nights with wet underwear on. Some of our faithful pioneers contracted malarial fever, and some of them still have the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four pioneers, including two sisters, heard that in the heart of the mountains there was a logging camp. There was no other way of reaching the camp than by the railroad cars that haul the logs to the sawmill. Obtaining permission from the Company to ride on the haulers, the &quot;locusts” reached the distant woods and &quot;combed” the entire camp, placing many pieces of literature. The upward trip was breath-taking enough, as the way passed by deep ravines and had sharp curves, but when in the return trip the &quot;locusts” had to ride on the logs being hauled, the sisters could not adequately describe their feeling— they just remember holding their breath and closing their eyes. Not a hair of the courageous pioneers was hurt. By the way, all those four had to run away from their parents because of opposition to their full devotion to The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two pioneers covering an island in the Pacific Ocean had to use a banca to reach the isolated towns and barrios in the northern part of the island. Their boat capsized, and all their literature and clothes got wet. It took a week to dry them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the province where the brethren were often investigated by members of the &quot;strong-arm squad” on the suspicion that they might be spies or &quot;fifth columnists”, one of the brethren called at the Army quarters. After about two solid hours of questions and answers, the major and the captain got four books and several booklets each. The major wrote down all questions and answers and confessed he was greatly interested, and promised to look the matter up in his Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneer brethren found it advantageous to be away from their boarding places two or three days at a time or until the literature they carried was placed, sleeping where they were benighted. Tins enabled them to conserve much energy and to have more time in the field. To help the indigent interested ones and also to help maintain themselves, the brethren take advantage of the barter system. In exchange for the cost of printing of spiritual food, they receive meals, chickens, eggs, rice, corn, sugar, fruits, fish and vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A convention of Jehovah’s witnesses was held in Manila March 21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The exposd at the convention scorched Satan and his demons and earthly representatives so badly that greater persecution of Jehovah’s people here immediately followed. Seven pioneers covering the Cocos region had barely resumed their work after the convention, when they were accosted by the Catholic chief of police and the Catholic mayor of the town of Balaoan, province of La Union, and demanded that they get a permit to do their work. The brethren stood by their rights and refused to “give Caesar” what belongs only to God. The opposition afforded the brethren the opportunity to give pointed testimony to those “ I-am-the-law ” officials. The haughty mayor called all the barrio lieutenants to a meeting at a certain barrio, instructing them to use violence, if necessary, to prevent the brethren from entering the barrios without permit signed by himself. Fearing only the Lord, the brethren “combed” the -whole territory, in spite of all bitter oppositions. Some of the barrio lieutenants who were more reasonable than others expressed their disapproval of the mayor’s high-handed methods, after they heard the brethren’s explanation, and they willingly contributed for some literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Failing to “get Jehovah’s witnesses” by commercial ordinances, the Devil has been making much of his Fifth Column scarecrow in his desperate effort to stop the witness work here, as elsewhere. Since our convention his religious papers have wickedly lied frequently about the Society and its work, maliciously stating that Jehovah’s witnesses have no respect for the law and constituted authority and that it is the purpose of the Society to undermine and overthrow the existing governments. The brethren in the island of Negros were greatly abused, being dubbed by the demon-controlled as gangsters and Communists. The brethren in northern Mindanao were suspected as Japanese spies, and had a very hard time finding lodging for the night when covering the distant barrios and mountains. One of that group narrowly escaped being hacked with a bolo by a demonized person. On the other hand the brethren are often suspected of being German “ fifth columnists ’ ’. In almost every town and barrio they were investigated and often insulted by haughty, unprincipled public officials, especially the strong-arm squad. In all these the brethren joyfully and patiently bear all sufferings and reproaches, grateful that they are privileged to have a small share of the reproaches that fall on the name of The Theocrat and on his ruling King. To them this is a token that the Lord is with them and that Armageddon is immediately to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren here expect much greater persecutions to follow. The Philippine School Board has been campaigning in favor of compulsory flag-saluting, not only in the public schools but in private institutions as well. Jehovah’s witnesses have been prominently mentioned in the papers as stubborn opposers to compulsory flag-saluting. Then, too, just the other day the newspaper reported that Mr. Manuel L. Quezon, president of the Philippine Commonwealth, signed the bill (it is now a law) which gives the president the power of a totalitarian dictator. Mr. Quezon is an avowed Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Jonathan Sheep</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord and his angels have been gathering fast His “other sheep” here. Great is the joy of the anointed and their companions in being associated with the Lord in this “harvest” work. Back-calls are made; model studies started for the newly interested; and those who truly desire to be bought by the Lord are led in the field service. Many of those dear Jonathan sheep are proving more zealous than some who claim to be of the anointed class. On they come out of doomed religion to Zion to worship The Theoerat in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the increase of the Lord’s fold here, our office had become too small, so it was necessary, last January, to rent another space upstairs—but still the place is not enough. The brethren therefore have considered building a Kingdom hall and a Bethel home, to the glory and honor of the great Theoerat and his Government. The method of the Australian Branch in getting the necessary money to carry out the project is being tried here, and indications are that our effort in this line will also be blessed by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1939 we had 14 companies; now we have 23; and more are waiting to be organized. There were 159 pioneers and company publishers in 1939; now we have an average of 222 (71 pioneers and 151 company publishers).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Religion” and “Refugees”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year this Branch received from Brooklyn Office the mighty weapons </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span><span class="font5"> While the first part of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font5"> plainly uncovers the snares of the enemy and points to the one place of refuge during Armageddon for the people of good-will, the second part has served as a sharp rebuke to the ‘ ‘ evil servant ’ ’ class, of which some are in the Philippines, and has also brought warning and much comfort to the anointed and their companions, the “Lazarus” class. To associate with the “evil servant” class means death—that is plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With ever-increasing violence or demonism, the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion </span><span class="font5">is a priceless blessing from the Lord. The anointed see “eye to eye” and, with hearts overflowing with joy and with songs of praise on their lips, they go amidst the demon-controlled, even as Noah of old. For these and all provisions of the Lord, “Instruction,” one of the latest of them, we give thanks to Jehovah, the Giver of all things good. The anointed and their companions here are determined to fight with you shoulder to shoulder until all creation praise the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At Trinidad, B.W. I., the witness work is carried forward there, at Grenada, Dominica, and Barbados. The distribution of books and booklets amongst the people during the year was, to wit, 11,901.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In submitting his report the Society’s local servant says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the instigation of the clergy, civil governments in these islands have made use of emergency war regulations to impede our peaceful work, and on occasions have stultified themselves, in that one department upsets the proper action of another; as that one department gives license for the importation of Bible literature, and another department of the same government seized it on arrival. In another island, one department gave the requisite license, and another held up the order, so that it never reached Brooklyn. There have also been prosecutions for having certain of the publications m possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant visited many of the islands during the year, but spent most of the time in the island of Barbados. A few days after his arrival there in the month of December last, the company servant was promised space in one of the buildings of the Park where the Annual Exhibition was to be held, but when he returned to see the part assigned, none was available to us, but just then someone in connection with the arrangements came up and pointed the secretary to a small space near by that had not been apportioned to anyone; this was granted to us. Another person of good-will mentioned where we might get the building materials to erect a booth. We went into the city and saw the merchant, who at first refused to allow any more of his material to be taken to the exhibition grounds, but afterwards changed his mind, not only allowed us to have what was required on loan, free of charge, but recommended a carpenter to do the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The booth was erected, and in it were displayed literature, phonographs, records. From time to time lectures were presented by means of the electrical transcription machine, also some musical records. We had a nice sign over the entrance “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom, which is at the doors”; at the side was another about religion and Christianity. These were seen by many persons, including a number of clergymen; one of these taking tea at a booth near by was so arrested when his attention was called to the front sign that he seemed to forget his tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sound servant also got a new idea and started using the E.T.M. in the mornings, just when people had awakened but some not yet out of bed; this he would do only one morning in each district. These programs were heard by rich and poor; some enjoyed them, whilst others lay in bed and writhed. One rich lady said the program was good, whilst a relative in the same residence objected. Some of the objectors got in touch with the police, others with higher government officials. Afterwards we were allowed to import books, but no license was allowed for records; later other threats which had long been made seemed to take effect, and import licenses were refused for literature, and the journals also held up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Frequent field days of witnessing parties by bus and car were held in this island, and in the month of July there was baptismal service, also convention on the 28th, corresponding with the last day of that in the U.S.A.; the hall was packed out. We tried to get your speech by radio and, when it seemed not to be on the air, put on “Violence” by the E. T. machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here in the island of Trinidad there was a fine convention Sunday, September 29; 350 were present, of whom 39 by water baptism symbolized their consecration to Jehovah. Both here and in the island of Barbados there have been fewer workers, but a good increase in hours and sound machine attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whilst due to conditions and circumstances there is not in some of the islands as much activity as there has been in past years, the brethren are loyal at heart and mean, by Jehovah’s grace, to maintain their integrity towards him to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some places the up-to-date spiritual food is irregular, yet we are fed, and joyful as transpiring events prove that the battle of that great day of God Almighty which ushers in the blessings of his Kingdom is so near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Work was done at the islands of Montserrat and St. Vincent, but reports have not been received.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the disturbed conditions of the world resulting from the war, the censoring of mail, and other difficulties, a number of the countries wherein Jehovah's witnesses have during the year engaged in preaching the gospel and distributing literature have been unable to report to this office; and therefore it is impossible to insert here a report from such countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the end of the fiscal year of 1939 the total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people declaring the message of the great Theocratic Government totaled 309,484,991. During the fiscal year ending 1940 there have been placed in the hands of the people books and booklets, according to the reports made to this office, to the number of, to wit, 28,264,329. This brings the total placement of books and booklets with the people to 337,749,320. This does not represent all the placements, by any means; for the reason that millions manufactured and shipped to various depots have been distributed and the reports for such have not reached this office, for the reason above stated. If we had the detailed reports from the countries that are missing, we are certain, the distribution would exceed thirty million for the fiscal year. It is thus seen that there is a wide publication of the Kingdom literature, and that in many languages, to wit, 88. As the Scriptures declare, “God is no respecter of persons,” and those who labor in his field are no respecters of persons. From every nation, people, kindred and tongue there have come forth and there are still coming many people to the Lord to serve him and declaring their devotion to him. The division amongst the people about which Jesus spoke in Matthew 25:31-46 is now in progress. Those who are of the goats quickly manifest themselves and show their cruel disposition toward anyone who advocates God’s kingdom and who advertises the Kingdom. These are in the majority. On the other side, those who are of good-will toward God and who seek righteousness and meekness the Lord designates as his “sheep” because they are harmless and have a keen desire to know the Lord and to do his will and to do good to all men as they have opportunity. As they receive the truth they quickly engage in the witness work themselves. Those who are of the “other sheep” of the Lord now coming to find refuge and protection under him manifest a clear vision of God’s purpose, readily grasp the truth concerning the Kingdom and its purpose, and joyfully participate in declaring these truths to others who have a hearing ear. Their devotion is not to any earthly organization, but their devotion is wholly to Almighty God and his kingdom under Christ. Their hopes are not for the blessings that this present unhappy world could possibly bring, but their hopes are centered entirely upon the kingdom of the great Messiah and the blessings it will bring to all who are obedient to the commandments of the Most High. Surrounded by tribulation everywhere, the “great multitude” is coming out of this great tribulation and they are ‘washing their robes in the blood of the Lamb’, which language in symbol means that they are trusting wholly in the shed blood of Christ Jesus as their redemptive price, and their robes are a symbolic identification of themselves as being on the side of God and Christ his King and serving the Kingdom. These, as set forth in the seventh chapter of Revelation, are praising Jehovah and his King. The “great multitude” is growing in numbers every day; and while the tribulation around them increases and the reproach of the enemy falls upon them, they, together with the remnant, rejoice with great gladness of heart that they are privileged to suffer for righteousness’ sake, that their integrity may be tested and proved to the Lord and that they may have a part forever in his organization and enjoy the blessings of life, liberty and happiness without limitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If those who oppose The Theocratic Government really knew what it means, they would change their course of action immediately. The hope of life everlasting is held out only to those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and serve him and who are obedient to the commandments of Almighty God as Jesus is obedient. The “battle of that great day of God Almighty”, which is near at hand, will soon take place and will result in the complete destruction of all of Satan’s organization, and all who hold to that organization must, as the Lord declares, go down with the wicked one. Some nations have heretofore claimed to be Christian nations, meaning by that that their confidence and trust and devotion is to Christ, but today no nation is found on earth that advocates or supports God’s kingdom under Christ, and the Lord Jesus dedares that all who are not for him are against him, and those who are not supporting his kingdom now are therefore in opposition: “He that is not with me is against me.” (Matt. 12:30) The fate of those who are not for Jehovah’s kingdom is announced by the Lord himself in this text: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”— Ps. 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s “other sheep” see that their hope for life everlasting is centered entirely in the kingdom of the great Theocracy, and they count the sufferings that now come to them by reason of their faithfulness to The Theocracy as nothing compared to the great blessings that shall be enjoyed by those who remain true, firm, and steadfast for God and his kingdom under Christ. It is a time of great testing, to be sure, but a blessed time for those who love the Lord because they have the opportunity to prove their unqualified devotion to him and thereby maintain their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The remnant and the “other sheep” of the Lord are therefore marching hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, never breaking their line, always standing firmly together, sincerely supporting each other and supporting the Kingdom and having their hearts and minds set wholly upon the kingdom of God under Christ and the blessings it will bring to the obedient ones of humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whether it shall be the Lord’s will that another </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> be published before Armageddon, of course, no one can say. What the immediate future holds it would be unwise to try to predict. All the surrounding circumstances, however, indicate that the battle of Armageddon is near at hand, which means the end of wickedness in the earth and the full ushering in of righteousness. It is therefore urged upon all who are of good-will toward God to now remain steadfast and true to the Lord and not permit anything whatsoever to separate them from the love of God. The apostle Paul, who endured great affliction for the name of Christ, states the heart sentiment of those who are now on the side of Jehovah and his King Christ Jesus, in these words: “For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”—Rom. 8: 38, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The glorious prospect is set before all those who love the Lord. Continue therefore to go forward in the service of his kingdom, trusting in the Lord with all your heart; and in everything acknowledge him, and, true to his promise, he will guide each and every one of his people in the way that he should go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This report is submitted with the hope that it may do good to some and that, as others read it, they will see their privilege of uniting with the little company of Christians now on the earth and with them engage in full and complete devotion to the great Theocracy under Christ Jesus. With love and best wishes toward all who love righteousness this report is submitted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Minutes of the Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society held at 907 Middle St., N. S. Pittsburgh, Pa., October 1,1940</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the absence of the president, Vice-President N. H. Knorr called the meeting to order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chairman called on Brother Van Amburgh to seek divine blessing and guidance upon the deliberations of His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Hrant Suiter was elected temporary secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was moved and unanimously carried that the-minutes of the previous meeting be dispensed with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chairman then conveyed to the meeting Brother Rutherford’s message of love and greetings, also the message of love from the Bethel family. He then read Brother Rutherford’s letter to the annual meeting, also a cablegram from the London Office regarding the joyful and successful convention held in London on September 29, in the midst of the din of war and bombing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was moved and unanimously carried to forward to Brother Rutherford by wire a message of love, greetings, appreciation and declaration of continued loyalty to Jehovah and his Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was further moved and unanimously carried to request the president of the Society to give his yearly report in printed form and publish same in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> and also that he incorporate therein his letter to the annual meeting,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chairman called upon the secretary-treasurer for a report. Brother Van Amburgh gave a short resume showing that the Lord had provided the wherewithal to carry on so great a work and that His hand was not the least shortened, and that the Lord evidently had much work yet for his people to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">at Annual Meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another fiscal year has ended and you have assembled to transact formal business of this Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year now ended has been a strenuous one, fraught with many trying and thrilling experiences and filled with much more j‘oy in the Lord. We are reminded that it is written in God’s Word for us, “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God,” and we rejoice in tribulation which comes to us by reason of faithful service to Jehovah and His King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trying experiences of the year past, the persecution and reproach of God’s people by the enemy, and which persecution daily increases, testifies that we are near Armageddon and that soon we shall see a complete change. The present time is the day ‘when the wicked spring up as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish’. Never at any time has there been such wickedness and lawlessness against Christians in America as today. The Lord points out in His Word that when this comes to pass ‘it is then that the wicked shall be destroyed for ever*. With that we have nothing to do. The Lord will fight our battles. We are His witnesses to declare His name and His kingdom, and that, by His grace, we will continue to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because we love righteousness and hate iniquity we are on the side of the great Theocracy; we fully trust the great Theocrat Jehovah God, and His King, Christ Jesus. We know that salvation and deliverance belong to God, and that this He will grant His faithful people in His due time. In this we are content and joyful in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every one of the faithful servants of Jehovah now has grown stronger in faith and devotion by reason of the many experiences of the year past. Continue to be faithful and strong m the Lord and to zealously do with your might what our Lord and King has directed us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although absent, I am with you fully in spirit and in service endeavoring to do my part. Encourage the brethren everywhere. Comfort and aid those of good-will. The day of deliverance is near!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With much love and best wishes, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your brother and servant by His grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J. F. Rutherford, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">President, </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J. F. Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Loving greeting. Your comforting letter much appreciated. We rejoice with you in the many privileges of service and assure you and through you our brethren throughout the world of our Christian love and continued and hearty co-operation. Our earnest desire is to honor Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Salvation unto our God . . . and unto the Lamb.&quot;—Rev. 7:10, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">/^HRIST JESUS is the great prophet of Jehovah God. After his resurrection and appearance in heaven he caused his faithful servant John to record the prophecies known and set forth in the Bihle as Revelation. Among those things recorded there are the words of the yeartext: “Salvation unto our God . . . and unto the Lamb.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the world the present is a time of great darkness. The rulers are in darkness, even as the people are in darkness concerning the purpose of Almighty God. No means of relief and deliverance from distress and darkness is offered hy worldly governments, as indeed none could possibly he provided by such governments. All these are against The Theocracy and are following traditions and being led by blind leaders into the ditch of despair and destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who have given their devotion entirely to Jehovah and his King are in the light of the new day. They trust wholly in the Most High and in his King, Christ Jesus. The words of the text selected for the year express the sincere heart-sentiment of each and all of such. By faith they see that the blackness that now envelopes the earth will soon be gone and that the light and glory of The Theocracy will fill the earth. Therefore they sing to Jehovah, as set forth in the text, and all creation that survives Armageddon likewise joins in the song of praise to Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The detailed consideration of the yeartext appears in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> of November 1, 1940. Everyone who puts his trust in the Lord will study that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> with profit. Then for each day of the year a text has been selected, with appropriate comments taken from the Watchtoweb publications. It is the hope that these brief morning studies will bring consolation and joy to all who love and truly trust God and his King. Be diligent to feed upon the spiritual food which the Lord has provided for his people, and thus continue strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Remember at all times that our strength, protection and salvation come to us from God and are through his Theocbatic Government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; he is their strength in the time of trouble.—Ps. 37:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the Almighty, the Rock, the Eternal King, the Fortress, the Deliverer, the power of salvation. His salvation is for the righteous, that is, those who believe on him and who joyfully obey his commandments. The end of the willful transgressor is destruction. The man who looks to another source for salvation is a fool and by his action declares there is no Almighty God Jehovah. These are days of peril, when the wicked one is endeavoring to destroy all men and, acting through his earthly agents, is seeking specifically to destroy those who have devoted themselves to Jehovah. The ever-increasing woes upon the peoples of earth cause many to desire to find a way of escape. There is but one means of escape from disaster, and that is the way which Jehovah God has provided for those who love him and who prove that love by gladly serving him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near and hasteth greatly.—Zeph. 1:14, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It must have appeared to the leaders of Israel as a very strange work in which Zephaniah was engaged, going about among them and uttering prophecy of approaching disaster. That prophet was blind to everything aside from his commission from Jehovah, and he straightway delivered the message that God had committed to him. By his prophecy through Zephaniah God informs mankind of the rapidly approaching calamity upon the world. Then none will be able to buy deliverance from destruction with any material gain they have acquired, legally or illegally. God will make a thorough clean-up of the entire enemy organization and will bring to a terrible end all who disregard his warning message and who therefore willingly continue to hold to and support Satan’s organization. It will be quick action on the Lord’s part. TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Seek ye the Lord while he may be found.—Isa. 55:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The-call to the people of “Christendom”, to both the haughty and the' meek, is to gather themselves together. The haughty and disobedient will be gathered for destruction. Those of good-will toward God, who give heed to the call, will find the place of safety. All are commanded to make a self-examination in the light of Jehovah’s judgments written aforetime. This examination must be done before Armageddon arrives, at which time religion and all religious organizations and all who stick to religion shall be destroyed. “Christendom” does not heed the call for self-examination and obedience to God. Therefore she will be destroyed beyond hope of recovery. God addresses all the meek of the earth who have not resisted him or scorned his instruction, but who have lined up with his judgments as they have been heard and understood. All these he bids to seek him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, 1 am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation!—Zeph. 2:15, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today religious totalitarian rulers say to Jehovah’s faithful servants: <sup>&lt;f</sup>What can your God do for you? Look to us; we are mighty.” They boastfully say: “I am the great one; I am the state, the citizen is nothing.” Similar boasting was done before the people of Jerusalem when Hezekiah was king. Then in one night God sent his officer who slew the boasting Assyrians. In one hour the totalitarian rule shall come to an end and perish from the earth. Now totalitarian misrule defies The Theocracy. This is the time when “the abomination of desolation” stands where it ought not to stand. It claims to be the world’s rightful ruler. Therefore this is the time when those of good-will must “flee to the mountains”, God’s organization, if they would be hid in the time of “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezek. 18:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah thus states what shall he the result of his final judgment. He gives warning to the wicked which they must hear just before execution of his judgment at Armageddon. He also assures the faithful ones who have been diligent in seeking righteousness and meekness that his favor shall be upon them. Jehovah has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. It would please God if the wicked would turn from their wickedness and live. Not doing this, they must meet the conditions of the final judgment. Justice is the foundation of his throne, and justice shall be administered. Final warning, therefore, is given in kindness of Jehovah to the end that those who have been deceived by the demons and led in the wrong way might have an opportunity to escape. He assures those who devote themselves to him that they may live. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1 /AO</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has provided a place of security for those only who give heed to his Word and joyfully obey his commandments. This assurance from the Lord is of great comfort in these days of peril. The demons are besieging the minds of people and have taken possession of the mind of every person now on earth who does not turn himself to the Lord. The earnest student of His Word discerns that the climax is near and that soon Jehovah will express his wrath against all enemies of The Theocracy. The faithful are diligent now to seek righteousness and meekness that they may remain in the place of safety during Armageddon and receive complete deliverance in God’s due time. Safety now is guaranteed to only those who hearken unto the Lord’s Word, and who are diligent and alert to learn and to obey. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Zeph. 3:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the World War the consecrated, because of fear of man, failed to do their duty, and therefore the Lord rendered his unfavorable judgments against them. In 1919 the faithful began to awaken to the real situation. When they discerned that Christ Jesus was at the temple their joy in reality began. Jehovah took away the unfavorable judgment against them, and the spirit of the Lord rested upon the faithful. The “prisoners” restrained by “Babylon” were then released from Satan’s organization because adverse judgment of Jehovah was taken away and because the faithful had repented and turned with full devotion to God and his King. The enemy was removed from God’s organization. Thereafter the rod of the wicked was not permitted to rest on the lot of the righteous. Thus Jehovah delivered the captives.

<p><span class="font5">Men who are designated by people of the world as “great lights”, or shining ones, receive adoration, praise and worship, which belong alone to Almighty God. There are great ecclesiastical “lights”, so called, who Tiave a show of godliness but deny the power thereof’. Men praise and serve them contrary to God’s Word. Jehovah God is the great Light, “dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto.” Instead of worshiping the Almighty God humans indulge in the worship of creatures, which worship is an abomination in Jehovah’s sight. Men worship the state or corporate ruling power. They call the League of - Nations “a great light”. In this manner the light of God is entirely ignored and all light attributed to men. Stargazers and creature-worship God declares he will completely cut off. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/40</span></p>

Under the influence of the demons, and therefore in darkness as to God’s purpose, the opponents of The Theocratic Government will be taken entirely unawares. Such &quot;drunken” ones are asleep as to what is Jehovah’s purpose. The faithful ones who trust in God will be fully awake and know what is about to come. Armageddon, when once begun, will continue till every part of Satan’s organization is destroyed, beyond hope of possible recovery. That battle will mark the final end of the enemy. In the hour of proud, exulting self-security of religionists and allies sudden destruction shall come upon them all because of their opposition to the great Theocrat.

<p><span class="font5">The kingdom of God, for which Jesus taught his followers to pray, is The Theocracy, because it is the government of the Almighty God with Christ Jesus as King, who is the world’s rightful and righteous Ruler. All unrighteousness is pitted or arrayed against The Theocracy. This marks the dividing of the people of the earth into two separate and distinct groups. Christ Jesus is the great Judge. He sits in judgment of his own people and the nations, and the judgment of the nations is the dividing of the people, and that judgment has for some time been in progress. Every person upon earth now must be put in one of the two classes, and by his own course of action he puts himself in one or the other. Therefore everyone must end up either as a &quot;goat” or as a &quot;sheep”, namely, one opposed to The Theocratic Government or one in favor of it.

<p><span class="font5">Those of the “remnant” are the “daughter” of Jehovah and his organization, the visible part of his organization Zion, pictured by his “woman”. It is now the time when the members of Christ’s body, the 144,000, both those in heaven and the remnant on earth, must together sing the new song unto Jehovah. All the people of good-will, who see and delight to support The Theocratic Government, must join in that song of praise. The time for sanctimonious appearance and gloominess is past. The faithful now have a deep and genuine joy. They rejoice because they see that vindication of Jehovah’s name is certain to be accomplished in the near future. Such joy of the Lord is the strength of the remnant. They see that The Theocratic Government of righteousness is come and that now they will rejoice for evermore.

<p><span class="font5">This applies also to those who will form the “great multitude”, and which people have been kept back from Jehovah by the influence exercised upon them by religionists. All such are commanded now to seek further instruction in meekness and to learn Jehovah’s way, the right and righteous way. Therefore God says to all such: “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.” All, then, who are thus instructed must be for The Theocratic Government and support it with zeal and joy. The selfimportant, haughty, self-righteous, know-it-all, will not be able to find a hiding place during the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Only those who continue to ascertain his will to give heed to it will thus fulfill his requirements and have hope of being hid from the great destruction that shall be wrought at Armageddon.

The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.” (Ps. 34:15, 16) Almighty God is the fountain of life. ‘Salvation belongs to God,’ by and through Christ Jesus. (Pss. 36:9; 3:8; Rom. 6:23) There is no other means of salvation to life. (Acts 4:12) Religion is the product of the demons, used by them to ensnare men and turn them away from God and into destruction. Those who embrace and follow traditional and religious teachings of men will find that they will end in destruction, because religion is contrary to and in defiance of God’s Word.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey.—Zeph, 3:8. </span><span class="font5">Here the Most High is telling “Christendom” and all others of Satan’s organization to wait for just a short time and then all the enemies shall get what is justly coming to them. Then no longer will the execution of judgment be delayed. “Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their [destruction] slumbereth not.” (2 Pet. 2:3; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> The end of all demons and of all earthly agents of demons has come, and judgment shall be executed quickly. Thus Jehovah warns of his purpose to act. The hour for him to strike has not yet arrived; hence he says to the enemy: ‘Just you wait until my time to act, and then you will change your boastful cockiness, when you fully know that Jehovah is Almighty God.’ Jehovah is self-contained. He depends on nothing, and he acts when he gets ready to act. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/40</span></p>

His faithful people on earth now, like Zephaniah, give all credit, honor and praise to the Almighty God and to his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">g Christ Jesus for the revelation and understanding of the prophecy. No man should take credit therefor, nor could he take credit therefor and be pleasing to the Lord. Zephaniah is quick to declare that the prophecy is not of his or any other man’s origination nor is it his or any other man’s message. He takes no credit for being wise and educated so as to be able to forecast events with dependable certainty. He plainly makes known that the uttered prophecy is not man’s, but is the message of Almighty God sent to those who desire to be instructed. Such introduction should get the instant attention of all who profess to serve Jehovah. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lt/1/40</span></p>

The &quot;remnant”, together with those who will form the &quot;great multitude”, he commands to shout aloud his praises. He lifted his adverse judgment off the faithful, restored spiritual Israelites, the remnant; he has cleared out from them the hypocritical enemies and made his own faithful servant to stand out separate and distinct from all who practice religion. The faithful, appreciating the presence of the Lord at the temple and that the great Theocrat is blessing and guiding those who maintain their integrity toward him, have full confidence that the Lord is shielding them from the assaults of the enemy and therefore that they have every reason to rejoice.

These must hear and do hear and give heed to Jehovah’s warning. Also there are those held within the confines of &quot;Christendom” and who are sad of heart and sigh and cry because of the abominations committed by her. (Ezek. 9:4) Religious leaders of &quot;Christendom”, and political and commercial allies, have no desire for the individuals within their borders who disapprove of &quot;Christendom’s” actions and the many abominations committed therein. Those persons who are of good-will toward God “hear the warning from him, but receive it sincerely. They need to search themselves and to reason out the matter in the light of God’s Word and come to a proper conclusion.

His justice being symbolized by a lion, he will go after the doomed prey and thereby give witness to all creation, and for all time, that the Almighty is Jehovah God and that his power shall be exercised against lawlessness in wiping out all wickedness. The enemies of The Theocracy in boastful defiance openly and without disguise carry into action their conspiracy to rule the world contrary to Jehovah’s appointed way. Thus they arouse Jehovah’s indignation and fierce anger, and he then, with zeal for his government of righteousness and his glorious name, begins his &quot;strange act”.

So likewise when the Lord Jesus sends forth his anointed from the temple he directs them to put on war equipment and to go to the battle. The enemy cannot see the equipment of Jehovah’s witnesses, for the reason that religionists are blind to the truth. They do not fight according to divine rules, but fight with blindness as to the proper course. In 1931 Jehovah’s witnesses began serving on religious leaders and allies the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, The Hope of the World.</span><span class="font5"> That was a message from the Lord, delivered by his servants, to those who insist on religion as being the hope of mankind.

<p><span class="font5">The announced woe of Jehovah here is upon Satan’s organization, and particularly the religious element thereof operating in the earth, and Jehovah’s time draws near when just punishment upon the wicked shall be executed. The woes that come upon rebellious ones from Jehovah are for just punishment. Presentday “Christendom” rebels against God, because she openly claims to be in a covenant with God, yet persists in breaking all his commandments and turning wholly to demonism. She sides in with God’s avowed enemy and works constantly against The Theocracy ahd the faithful people of the great Theocrat. She now works hand in hand with the heathen nations which openly defy Jehovah. “Christendom” is therefore a covenant-breaker and worthy of death.—Rom. 1:31,32.

<p><span class="font5">Likewise today Jehovah’s organization is the channel by which he speaks through Christ Jesus and issues instructions to his people of Christ’s body yet on earth. The messenger is not man’s, but God’s, even though men are used. God’s servants now on earth must recognize God’s organization, pictured by Deborah, as the Lord’s means of communicating instruction to the Lord’s servants. In the drama it was not Deborah that was speaking to a man and directing or commanding him or attempting to teach the man, but it was the Lord speaking through her. She denies any authority over Jehovah’s servant Barak, but acted as a servant bringing to man the Word of the Most High. Had it been a woman commanding, that command would have run afoul, as in Eve’s case in Eden. Orders issue through God’s organization.

<p><span class="font5">The preparation for the great and final event against the demons and their dupes began immediately upon the Lord’s coming to the temple in A.D. 1918. He then began to equip his faithful “remnant”, and sends them forth as his witnesses to proclaim his purpose and to gather unto himself his “other sheep”, the “great multitude”. These gathered to him participate with the remnant in proclaiming The Theocratic Government in vindication of God’s holy name. This the Lord does by giving them a “pure language” (Zeph. 3:9) that they may without fear of men or demons go forward and vigorously tell the good news of The Theocratic Government to the people, that the day for vindication of Jehovah’s great name has come and that he has set up his government of righteousness, which shall render justice and blessings in particular to those who obey his Word.

<p><span class="font5">Being “hid” is to be hid from destruction by Jehovah’s commissioned Executioner, who will execute the wicked at Armageddon. A type of such hiding was that of Noah and his family, who were hidden in the ark. “The Lord shut [them] in.” (Gen. 7:16) Jeremiah was hid; so were Baruch, Ebed-meleeh, and the Rechabites, the sons of Jonadab, at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, and this foreshadowed how the faithful, obedient ones will be hid at Armageddon. The name Zephaniah means “hidden of Jehovah”, hidden both as a treasure and as against his enemies. Rahab hid the spies from their Canaanite enemies. The modern-day Rahab class, who are called “Jonadabs”, hide now the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses from their enemies. At Armageddon the faithful Jonadabs shall be hid as Rahab was at Jericho’s fall.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him.—Judg. 3:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point of the drama Ehud pictured Christ Jesus alone. He blew the trumpet to assemble all the Israelites, and thus pictured the Lord Jesus in command of ‘the armies of heaven’, that hear his trumpet sound for war and follow him. Undoubtedly Ehud blew his war trumpet that same day of his escape, and it was to summon the men of war. Ehud must strike at the time while the enemy was still demoralized. Thus at this point he pictured Christ Jesus at the particular time when Jehovah’s “strange work” on earth is completed. It is the time antitypically to begin the “strange act”, and Christ Jesus, the Greater Ehud, sounds the war trumpet, calling the angelic host of heaven to follow Him into the war for the execution of the enemy.

<p><span class="font5">Why did God extend mercy to David and deliver him and save him from his enemies? For the same reason that he in mercy grants protection, deliverance and salvation to the remnant and their companions; and that is, for His name’s sake. Jehovah’s name is called upon the anointed remnant, and the Jonathan class become companions of the remnant in declaring Jehovah’s name. The individuals who make up these classes are not of first importance, but are only of secondary importance. God does everything for his name’s sake. It is his great name that is involved and must be vindicated. Concerning those of spiritual Israel and their companions, in behalf of whom he exercises mercy, Jehovah says: “But I had pity for mine holy name, ... I do not this for your sakes, 0 house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake.”—Ezek. 36:21, 22. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In 1918 Jehovah’s people were cut off from enjoying their assembly together, and this by reason of being taken away captives by the enemy. Some were actually imprisoned; all were restrained of their liberty. In 1918 Christ Jesus came to the temple and the saints who had long been dead were resurrected and gathered to the Lord. The captives on earth sorrowed, waiting for the gathering to the temple on Mount Zion: “ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.” (Rom. 8:23) Those exiled during 1918 from God’s appointed place of meeting rejoiced when they were gathered together in 1919 and when the Lord revived the work of The Theocracy. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Within a very short time they will have completely suppressed the witness work. That will mean that Jehovah’s “strange work” is completed according to his will. It will show that the conspirators have deliberately, with malice aforethought, performed their wicked part against Jehovah and his witnesses. The closing of the witness work will certainly be the occasion when religionists and allies will boastfully say: “Peace and safety.” The proclamation that “all’s well” will be occasion for them to begin to congratulate and felicitate one another. Amidst their drunken revelry they will say among themselves and to one another: ‘Peace and safety; we are all right now.’ That will be the “sign” or proof positive that Armageddon is about to break.

Such class turn to the wicked world and are opposers of The Theocracy and of those who publish the name of Jehovah and his government. In striking contrast with the “evil servant” God foretold a “remnant” that now serve him and who receive great persecution, and he puts these words into the mouth of his “faithful servant” class: “All this [reproach and persecution] is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way.”—Pss. 44:17, 18; 80:17, 18. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/40</span></p>

Totalitarianism is a “complete black-out”, that is, in darkness and entirely away from Jehovah’s favor. Satan’s organization, both invisible and visible, is fatally bent on punishing all who support The Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus. Why are cruel dictators destroying all the nations that refuse to yield to the totalitarian rule? Because such is the Devil’s scheme and means to carry out his wicked challenge against Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5">There are no superfluous words written in the prophecies. It is well known by God’s remnant that a name given by Jehovah is of deep significance relating to a prophecy. The name “Zephaniah” means “hidden of Jehovah”. Manifestly those included in the class “hidden of Jehovah” are hidden for their own protection, and this is shown by Psalm 83:3: “They [the enemies of God’s people] have taken crafty counsel .. . against thy hidden ones [(Hebrew) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">zaphan]” </span><span class="font5">Psalm 27: 5: “For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.” Psalm 31:20: “Thou shalt keep them secretly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[zaphan]</span><span class="font5"> in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.” Thus the name “Zephaniah” exactly fits God’s faithful remnant on the earth at the time the Kingdom is set up. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Antitypical Ethiopians are men of merchandise for selfish gain who in these last days hire themselves out to Egypt (world rulers) and fight against God’s witnesses and his kingdom, and do so for what selfish, temporary gain they reap therefrom. They plainly appear as sin-darkened. None of these shall be overlooked or “hid” at Armageddon Their being far removed or isolated will not aid or save them. There will be no way for them to escape. There may be among them some individuals that will escape, as foreshadowed by Ebed-meleeh of Ethiopia, and that showed favor to God’s servants and whom God did not forget. These must turn to God and serve him before Armageddon breaks. Such are the ones who now do good to the brethren of Christ Jesus, for which good deeds the Lord remembers them.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.—1 John 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in which Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are engaged is not done for any selfish reason, and certainly not for any pecuniary gain or worldly honor. Their work is done at the command of Almighty God. Because they love him and rejoice in the opportunity to obey his commandments, they engage willingly in said work, regardless of opposition. They know that God is love, therefore wholly unselfish, and that everything he does is unselfishly done. Jebovah’s witnesses are not carrying on a campaign to gain members to their ranks. They are not propagandists, not a sect or denomination. They are a company who have individually taken their stand on the Lord’s side and who jointly go forward in obedience to his commandment to publish The Theocratic Government and his provision for salvation.

<p><span class="font5">Satan has declared his purpose to be 'like the Most High”. He therefore sets up an organization, which is a mimic of Jehovah’s invisible organization. He exalts himself to the position of supremacy like that of the Most High, Jehovah. Gog, the chief officer of Satan, takes the place similar to that occupied by Jesus Christ, the Prince, Ruler or King of the great Theocratic Government. The wicked angels, that have direct influence and power over the nations, are made to correspond to the angels of Christ Jesus that are under his immediate command. As with the invisible organization of Jehovah, so the Devil has provided his organization with earthly representatives. The purpose of the Devil’s wicked organization is to operate in defiance of Jehovah God in his attempt to turn all creation against Almighty God and plunge them into destruction. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 1:H, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fulfillment of this part of the prophecy delivered by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses in the present time whom Zephaniah foreshadowed warns the people that the great and terrible day of Armageddon is near. The witnesses inform the people that the battle of that great day of God Almighty is the act, the “strange act” of Jehovah. This is not a mere human guess, nor political prognostication, nor creepy feeling of premonition, such as religionists have. This message from the prophet is based entirely on the facts, which God gave him to utter. These facts God brings to pass in fulfillment of the prophecy, and they lead to the Scriptural conclusion as to what is coming to pass. Such utterance is therefore authoritative. The message is the voice of Almighty God from Zion. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.—Prov. 29:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religion has long been the chief means of inducing men to yield to the influence of other men. The religious person fears the clergyman or leader of his religious system; hence he yields to the instruction of such men, and in this way the demons entrap the unsuspecting. A person fears that he will not receive the approval of men, particularly the religious leaders, and thus is led into the enemy’s snare. The only place of safety is with the Lord and only those who trust Jehovah and are diligent to render themselves in obedience can be safe in these evil days. Every consecrated one must diligently avoid the seductive influence of creatures. Every one who desires to have God’s approval must see to it that he does not rely upon men, because men are imperfect. Follow men only as such men follow the Lord Jesus Christ.

<p><span class="font5">The Euphrates symbolically represents the peoples of earth, and the sixth vial poured out is a warning from God to the people of good-will that they may flee from Babylon, the Devil’s organization, and turn to Jehovah’s organization under Christ. “The kings of the east” mean Jehovah, the great Theocrat, and The Christ, Head and body. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus upon the earth perform their part as witnesses or bearers of God’s message of wrath to the people. The drying up of the waters of the great river Euphrates symbolically pictures the turning of the people of good-will away from Satan’s organization, the religious systems. This work greatly enrages all the demons and also those people on the earth who practice the demon religion. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The meek here addressed must flee from religion and hence come out from the Devil's organization and do so before Armageddon begins. They seek the Lord in troublesome times and are the ones that ‘come out of great tribulation’, which tribulation is now upon all nations of the earth. This is the time for those to flee to the place of safety. Such persons of good-will toward God, who have a desire for the truth, come out from among the religionists and out from all the nations and away from them that have turned back from following the Lord and from those who “have not sought the Lord nor inquired after him”. (1:6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span><span class="font5"> )The Lord is not in the religious systems. The clergy have failed to tell the people about God’s kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">When Armageddon begins and after the Most High rises up to the prey, those of Zion and who have maintained their integrity toward God will be safe. All the world will realize then that Almighty God is backing up his people, that his everlasting arms are beneath them, and that his strength is exercised in their behalf. The faithful with Christ Jesus will then rejoice with fullness of joy because they shall witness the vindication of Jehovah’s name. “And the inhabitant [of Zion; those who have proved their integrity] shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.” (Vs. 24) Lawlessness of Zion, in 1918, has been forgiven. The Lord evidences this forgiveness, and from and after 1922 particularly the joy of the faithful ones has increased and reaches its fullness at the execution of Jehovah’s “strange act”.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction—Rom. 9: 82.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time arrives when the long-suffering of Jehovah toward his enemies comes to an end. That time is just the hour preceding Armageddon when God begins to maneuver his forces and the enemy forces for final execution of his judgment written against the wicked. God sends forth his messengers especially throughout “Christendom” and causes them to sound his final warning to her that Armageddon is near. Instead of receiving such instructions and giving heed to such warning, big religious leaders say in defiance of the Most High: “We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement.” To such boastful words Jehovah says: “Your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand.”—Isa. 28:15, 18.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 2:3, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some individuals, like Jonathan at the battle of Gilboa, may die at enemy hands at Armageddon and die because they persist in maintaining their integrity toward God. Yet they will not perish, but will receive life in the resurrection. The “great multitude” as a class will survive at Armageddon, although some individuals may die at enemy hands. The Lord's anger or wrath, there executed by Christ Jesus, will not come upon those who are thus hidden. Jehovah’s anger has now been turned away from his remnant. His anger will be turned away from those of the “great multitude” who comply with his commandments. It is therefore imperative for all to seek meekness and righteousness before Armageddon and to continue faithful and true to The Theocracy if they would find a place of safety.

<p><span class="font5">Violent opposition to The Theocratic Government will soon come to an all-time high point; concerning which Jehovah bids his faithful witnesses and all of good-will toward him to east away all fear of men and demons. He commands that fear must not paralyze them or cause them to slack their hands in the Kingdom service. To strengthen his people Jehovah assures them that he is with them and will fully deliver them from the enemy. He makes them know that he is pleased with their faithfulness and those who maintain integrity shall be forever blessed. No more shall the faithful halt between two opinions. Blind to everything but The Theocratic Government, they rejoice in declaring the name of the Most High, regardless of all opposition. They are certain to share in the victory of the Lord. He gives his Word that he will save his people. Therefore they trust him and will rejoice in his salvation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Their peace has been disturbed by the publication of the message concerning the fall of “Christendom”, the destruction of religion, and the establishment of the great Theocratic Government. They are certainly not disturbed because of the physical force employed against them by Jehovah's witnesses and their companions. They are frightened and disturbed, however, by reason of the message which these declare in their presence and hearing. Being disturbed because of the proclamation of the truth concerning The Theocracy, they endeavor to unite all force that they may muster to fight against The Theocracy and the ones who proclaim it. Their words of “peace” are not, in fact, for peace, so far as God’s servants are concerned. —Ps. 35:20. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The day is dark now, but the greatest darkness will eome when the battle of Armageddon is on. That darkness, no doubt, will be literal, as well as mental, and will compass all violators of God’s law that are upon the earth. In the vision which Jehovah gave of that terrible day the prophet Habakkuk was so moved by the invisible power of the Lord that he exclaimed: “The sun and moon stood still in their habitation; at the light of thine arrows [of liquid fire] they [Jehovah’s host] went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.” (Hab. 3:11) The literal darkness surrounding “Christendom” and other nations will be made worse by reason of the mental darkness of those who have claimed to serve God but who have not. Those who now refuse to hear Jehovah’s warning will then have only blackness, foreboding destruction, about them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/1$</span></p>

All such love Jehovah and joyfully serve him. Since the Lord’s coming to the temple the light of God shines upon Christ Jesus at the temple and that light upon him is reflected upon those of the temple company. All who remain in the temple are in the light and are duly informed of God’s purpose. All who flee to Jehovah’s organization under Christ receive light and protection if they continue faithful in their devotion to The Theocracy and in obedience to the rules thereof. Thus the Lord has given assurance to the remnant and their companions of his protection and blessing upon them during the period of the expression of his wrath.

He assures them that serve him that when his time arrives to vindicate his name he will remember for good all who have maintained their integrity toward him and will not pass over unnoticed any of the wicked. Those now on earth who are fully devoted to him are hated of all nations for his name’s sake, reproached and oppressed. His time to administer due recompense to the wicked is very near, and he will see to it that none of them escape. Jehovah makes inquisition, that is, he inquires into the facts and calls to mind the facts, that he may properly recompense those who have done wickedly and may put his blessing upon those who have obeyed him.

Thereafter the Lord began to gather his “other sheep”, which will form the “great multitude”, and which company must also speak the truth in unity with the faithful remnant. The remnant go forth then with this pure message, “pure lip,” a language of praise to Jehovah, and the “other sheep” join with them in such pure lip. They work together in unity to Jehovah’s praise and harmoniously support The Theocracy. All such ones, gathered unto the Lord, -came to see clearly that the vindication of his name is the real issue, and therefore they all united in proclaiming the praise of Jehovah.

The salvation needed is from destruction of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, which destruction is threatened by the combined enemy, and particularly the religious element. Jehovah has informed his people that the enemy should not prevail against them, although the enemy would fight against them While persecution increases, with faith m God and full confidence in him and his King those who truly serve the Lord now can confidently look to him for protection and say: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.&quot; W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1 /40</span></p>

These princes shall rule in righteousness under the direction of the Lord Jesus Christ.

That does not refer to saving from death due to Adam’s sin, but does mean salvation or deliverance from the Devil’s organization, which threatens destruction to the servants of God. It refers to deliverance of God’s faithful people, both the remnant and the “other sheep”, at Armageddon. Many times have these been delivered since 1919, and complete deliverance will come to the faithful at Armageddon, and that deliverance will be for the sake of Jehovah’s name. (Ps. 106:8) Seeing that the day of salvation is now at hand, this is no time for idleness, but the time for great energy and activity in proclaiming The Theocratic Government and the deliverance it will bring. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/40</span></p>

Rather the Scriptures show that every thing and every one of Satan’s organization, and which Satan uses to carry on the organization in the earth, shall be completely wiped out, that the earth might be clean and a fit habitation for righteous men.

He spoke through his prophets long ago, and now he brings to pass the fulfillment of the prophecy. He now sends his witnesses among the people to speak his message, and thus the Lord Jesus by his servants is delivering the command to the people from the Most High to keep still and listen.

Believing that the Almighty God is Jehovah, the meek gladly receive information that comes from God’s Word. The person who takes a selfish course and ignores the instruction set forth in God’s Word is a fool.

Not alone will the religious elements be completely cleared out during Armageddon, but also the combination of creatures over whom the demons exercise control and all who worship demons, including the political and commercial elements.

(Rev. 2:10) The language of Jesus above clearly settles the matter, that the oneness means full and complete unity in action. Therefore Jehovah, Christ Jesus and all others who have to do with The Theocratic Government must be fully united, all working in God’s organization under the direction of the Head thereof.

Jehovah then causes them to be called his witnesses and to show forth his praises and to exalt his name before others, and not to exalt men. During the World War the remnant were put to shame in their land.

The religious strongholds are Satan’s prison houses, in which many persons are held in ignorance of God’s Word. Religious leaders fight desperately to prevent the people from learning the truth, and by that means to prevent those of good-will from escaping from their prison houses. It is clearly Jehovah’s express purpose that the wicked religious institutions shall be uncovered to enable the people of goodwill to flee from them and find a place of safety in God’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W10/1//0</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Thus do those who are kings and priests unto God and Christ speak the praise of Jehovah and his kingdom. “He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.” (22.11) Those who have a pure heart toward God and his kingdom, who love Jehovah and his Theocratic Government, speak a pure message. They have the grace or favor from the Most High. The Lord is in no wise the friend of those who speak the words of opposition to The Theocratic Government. The speech or lip cannot be pure if it does not honor Jehovah. There must be a pure heart devotion to Almighty God and his kingdom, and then the speech will be pure. In the face of all wicked opposition to The Theocratic Government the faithful servants and devotees thereof continue to offer praise of their lips unto God and his King. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/I/Ifi</span></p>

To “famish all the gods” would mean their destruction. This would mean that commercial traffic would become very lean for “Christendom’s” clergy, and it is now becoming lean because the people of good-will are turning away from those religion mongers. Religion is now at a great discount, due to Jehovah’s “strange work”. Religious frauds are shriveling up. The mighty among the clergymen, becoming weak and lean, will famish when God causes the commercial and political mighty ones to close down on the religious racket. Then will follow the destruction at Armageddon of the mighty ones of the commercial and political forces. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/40</span></p>

The cruel action of religionists against his servants will in no wise cause those faithful servants to be dismayed. Courageously they march on! Jehovah God, whom we serve, will deliver his servants. Now God will show his mercy to all who fully trust and serve him. He will preserve and bless his people. He will fight their battles against their adversaries. He will lift the faithful ones high up and make them rejoice. Let all those who love righteousness now be diligent to seek righteousness and seek meekness and be always very courageous.

<p><span class="font5">The “remnant”, that is, the anointed of God, must now be meek and continue in meekness and in righteousness. To Christ Jesus Jehovah God has given the earth and the fullness thereof. Those with him as members of “his body” shall inherit the earth. The people of good-will who form the “great multitude” shall abide in the earth forever under the complete supervision of Christ Jesus. At the Red sea God performed a great miracle when he executed his judgment upon the Egyptians, which pictured his judgment from heaven that shall be executed at Armageddon upon all the world. Concerning this it is written: “Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.” (Ps. 76:8, 9) At that time those who seek meekness shall be delivered. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/JfO</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The call is for prompt and speedy action on the part of those who hear. There can be no delay. Speaking of the time of that great and dreadful day, Jesus emphasized the necessity for haste when he uttered these words: “Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.” (Matt. 24:17-20) That could not mean that the battle breaks out because beyond the control of the Lord, but does mean that God’s appointed time has come, and God does not delay for any reason whatsoever. Having purposed it, he brings it to pass exactly on time. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/lfi</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The vindication of Jehovah’s name shall now be accomplished, and it is his government by Christ Jesus that accomplishes this vindication. Salvation is not for the wicked at any time: “Far from the lawless is salvation, for thy statutes have they not sought.” (Ps. 119:155, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.')</span><span class="font5"> Salvation is only inside Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, and those who oppose The Theocracy cannot receive salvation. Those who are not wholly for The Theocracy are against Jehovah and his King. The Theocratic Government is of paramount importance, because that government vindicates Jehovah’s name, and unless one who claims to be the servant of Jehovah God now fully and entirely supports The Theocracy he cannot expect salvation from the terrors and destruction of Armageddon, nor salvation to life.

Envious of those who speak the truth and tell of The Theocracy and the relief it will bring to humankind, those agents of Satan persecute all who openly serve God and Christ the King. Bent upon arbitrary rule or ruin, they go beyond all proper limits and insist that the law of the state is supreme and the state must be obeyed under any and all circumstances. They magnify men and rulers, and thus magnify and exalt themselves against God, blaspheming and reproaching his name. They shall find no way to escape the wrath of Almighty God at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5">Here the apostle uses the definite article “the”, which removes the discussion from a mere consideration of any general chronological times. He was not encouraging the study of chronology to fix dates ahead of time and to ascertain what is definitely to take place at such future dates. He was certainly not encouraging anyone to speculate as to dates, nor to fix dates. The “signs” are more determinative than the dates. That would mean that the faithful should watch the signs of the tunes. When Jehovah has not in his Word foretold to men the limits of times, such time periods are indefinite to humans. Such times come to fullness at the point where God has foretold, and he furnishes the signs, that is, the physical facts, by which the fullness of times may be ascertained by his devoted ones.

There is no famine among God’s faithful people for hearing the Word of the Lord. Jehovah has made it clear that the power of the demons is exercised chiefly by the religious men. The faithful know they are surrounded by both invisible and visible enemies, but they trust in the power and protection of Jehovah of hosts. They are perfect in love, that is, in their entire devotion to The Theocratic Government. Hence perfect love casts out all fear of man and demons. They have boldness in this day of judgment in declaring the truth. They do not put on the soft pedal concerning the Theocratic message, nor do they yield to the demands of religious agents of the Devil. They obey God rather than men.

<p><span class="font5">The demons have employed religion to bring about this terrible condition and by means of religion have deceived multitudes and are still deceiving them and turning them away from God. Men have been made to believe, by the influence of the demons, that religion and Christianity are one and the same thing, whereas religion is the open and violent adversary of all Christians. Religion and the practice thereof are the result of demon power and influence. Christianity stands for the truth and full obedience to the law of Almighty God. Religion is demon-worship. Christianity is the worship of Jehovah God in spirit and in truth. Give thoughtful consideration to His commandments given to his typical people concerning religion, which commandments apply with stronger force to all today seeking righteousness.

To that great sacrifice the Lord bids his guests to come in order that they may have a part in the vindication of his name. Those who are invited must come to him with clean hands, that is, fully devoted to and in support of his King. Such participate in the sacrifice by partaking of the joy of the Lord Jesus Christ in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. These guests have been called or invited to the Kingdom service and now must devote themselves exclusively to that service in order to have a part in the vindication of his name. This prophecy was written and is now being fulfilled that the “man of God” may be fully equipped to participate in the service and have part in Jehovah’s “strange work”, and thus have a part in the vindication of his name.

Jehovah God has set his throne of judgment, and Christ Jesus, the great Judge, is proceeding with his work of judgment. To those of good-will toward God and whose devotion is to God and his organization, and who continue faithful, God has promised refuge and safety in the time of trouble: “The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.” (Ps. 9:9) The refugees must now flee to the Lord and serve him. These faithful ones of good-will now have a work to do, and the commandment concerning them is: “Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion; declare among the people his doings.” (9:11) Fully trusting in the Lord and knowing that he is their hope and salvation, they are abiding under his organization.

<p><span class="font5">At the temple judgment, which began in 1918, the approved ones were brought into the service of The Theocracy. To them the Lord committed the Kingdom interests. They must now offer unto Jehovah an offering in righteousness, and this they did when sent forth into the earth to perform their assigned work under Christ Jesus, their Head and King. The gathering here means the bringing of the spiritual Israelites, the faithful witnesses of God, into visible unity. Now God’s people have been brought into full unity as the Lord foretold by the apostle at Ephesians 4:13, 14.

<p><span class="font5">The crying out of “Peace and safety” by those who utter this message is really a false cry, because they are not in fact at peace. Religious leaders and totalitarian rulers desire to be at peace so far as any message regarding The Theocracy is concerned, and this they desire that they may carry on their own selfish desires to rule the world. By such outcry of “Peace and safety” they are bidding God and Christ to come to terms with them that they may not longer be disturbed by anyone. This is illustrated by King Joram of Israel when going out to meet Jehu, who was a picture of Jehovah God’s Executive Officer of the present time: “And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu ? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel, and her witchcrafts, are so many?” (2 Ki. 9: 22) Then Jehu slew King Joram. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/40</span></p>

Likewise the present day, with all the physical facts flung world-wide, shows that conditions existing in Noah’s day were similar to those which now exist upon the earth. All may see that the hurrying of the people of good-will now to God’s organization is an indisputable sign and proves that the day of Jehovah’s wrath upon all of Satan’s organization is due to strike very shortly. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/40</span></p>

None of these are in darkness. No ‘Tflack-out” for them, because they are in the light and know God’s purposes and know what will be the end. Those devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, having been brought into his temple, where they receive the reflected light of Christ Jesus, the Head of the temple, now continue to “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness” by joyfully proclaiming his name and his great Theocracy. The angels of heaven, and the faithful ones who have gone before and are resurrected and now with the Lord, join in song of praise to the Most High and his King.

The peak of the “distress of nations” comes at Armageddon and will cause nations and the people of the world to cry out in desperation. Where, then, will the people find the place of safety in that day? Certainly not with religious organizations or political institutions. Safety will be found only in one place, and that is under the organization of the Almighty God. “The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.” (Nahum 1:7,8) “The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead”; that is, into his trouble. —Prov. 11:8.

A meek person is one who desires to be taught the right way and who is diligent in seeking true information. To such Jehovah’s unfailing promise is: &quot;The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.” (Ps. 25: 9) To begin to receive instruction and to acquire true knowledge one must fear Jehovah, that is to say, greatly desire to have His approval and be fearful that such approval might not be granted. (Prov. 1:7) &quot;What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.” (Ps. 25:12) True instruction proceeds not from man, but from Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5">The clergy malign Jehovah's witnesses as a cult that hates the government and everything. The enemy would not tell the truth even if they could. Instead of Jehovah’s witnesses’ hating everything, it is exactly the contrary. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus now on earth love righteousness and hate wickedness and delight to be in the company of Christ Jesus, the Beloved One. If they loved the wicked things of this world they could not be the faithful servants of God and Christ. Jehovah has made the faithful followers of Christ Jesus his own witnesses because they love Jehovah and his King and love serving The Theocracy. Therefore the Lord commands his faithful servants: “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”—1 John 2:15. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1/41</span></p>

Persecution of his people and faithful servants will not be overlooked. The proud, haughty, self-centered ones persuade themselves that their contemptuous treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses is being noted only by men. They have overlooked the fact that they are ill-treating the Lord’s servants and that the Lord counts it as unto himself. ‘Forasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of my brethren, ye have done it unto me.’ (Matt. 25:40) Wicked deeds of the haughty, austere ones who now control the nations will not be overlooked by Jehovah’s Executioner at Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/40</span></p>

Those persons in the religious organizations who desire righteousness, and who have come in contact with this Kingdom message and heard it and believed it, have fled to the Lord. To those held in prison by the religious institutions the Lord has said: “Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves.” (49:9) All the faithful ones who continue in the light must continue to show forth the praises of Jehovah God and his King. “If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship,” partnership with God and Christ and with all the members of Zion.—1 John 1: 7. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/40</span></p>

The remnant, continuing faithful and obedient to the Lord, will maintain their integrity toward him, and therefore there will be no more occasion for Jehovah to visit evil upon them as he did in 1914 to 1918. Cruel persecution that now comes upon God’s people at the hand of the Hierarchy and totalitarian allies and their tools is not any evil from Jehovah. That does not express his displeasure concerning his faithful ones, but is evidence from the Lord that the remnant and their companions are his own people permitted to bear the reproach that fell upon Jehovah and Christ Jesus long centuries ago. The faithful servants of Jehovah know that no evil shall prevail against them. They know their salvation is assured.

The Greater Ehud, Christ Jesus, brought them unto himself at the temple, and they were made his representatives and representatives and servants of Jehovah. They were made “one in Christ Jesus”.

<p><span class="font5">The Hierarchy falsely charge the modern Ehudites with being the “fifth column”, and that the literature Jehovah’s witnesses place in the hands of the people is subversive. The Hierarchy well know they are lying. No witnesses or others on earth have said as much to expose Nazism, Fascism and Communism, and the Catholic Hierarchy, as Jehovah’s witnesses. Because the literature shows that the Hierarchy is working with the enemies of democracies and against God, it angers the Hierarchy. Hence their persecution of the servants of the Most High. They have attempted to destroy his witnesses, but by the Lord’s grace his faithful servants have escaped. They are under his protection, and he will see to it that the enemy prevail not against them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W10/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">King Jabin appears to picture the Devil himself, or his foremost demon prince, Gog. Gog has a visible representative on earth now, prefigured by Captain Sisera. The name “Sisera” means ‘^battle array” and well befits an army captain. Sisera was a practitioner of religion, or demonism, and therefore pictured demonism, or what today is generally called “organized religion”. Such is leading the visible fight against Jehovah’s Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus, and is inciting all of the political, commercial, judicial and military element against Jehovah’s witnesses because these proclaim the Theocratic Government as the ruling power that will bless mankind. Sisera’s mother was living in that day. She pictured the demon organization which mothers and brings forth religion. She looked for Sisera to gain the victory. She was disappointed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W11/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This Almighty God does because it is his day for squaring the accounts. He has put these rebellious ones into such a place that they cannot find the way out because they refuse to give heed to His Word. They will become desperate and go wild and hysterical and will cause everyone to turn against his fellow creatures. In their efforts to destroy one another they “walk like blind men” and fight as blind men. Blind and hysterical, the worldly leaders, who have been obstinate, brutish and foolish, will fight against one another and all shall perish. (Ps. 49:10) They will destroy one another as did the Midianites when Gideon and his little band of 300 faithful supporters put the enemy to flight.—Judg. 7: 20-22. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/10</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These words are addressed to the spiritual class on earth. Such faithful ones joyfully bear the reproaches that come upon God and Christ. They have no abiding place in the organization of Satan, but are seeking that great city or organization, The Theocratic Government. In the name of Christ Jesus all his faithful servants 'offer to Jehovah an offering in righteousness’. They offer “sacrifice of praise to God continually”; that is, their lips are given to praise his name. A plain picture of the cleansing of the lip is given at Isaiah 6:5-7, which states: 'The angel took from the altar a coal of fire, and put it upon the lip, and thus cleansed the lip of speech of God’s servant class.’ Following the cleansing the faithful ones say: “0 Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.”—Ps. 51:15.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the God of peace and harmony. Everything that is pleasing to him must be like him in this respect. Jehovah’s approved servants must dwell together in peace and act in exact harmony in carrying out the Lord’s instructions. Persons are not recognized because of their outward appearance, but God recognizes them because of their faithfulness to him and his organization. God is no respecter of persons or individuals. Man looks upon the outward appearance, but God looks upon the heart, that is, that which indicates one’s righteous motive. Since the Lord’s coming to the temple, all those brought into his organization must be at peace among themselves and in full unity move forward together in performing duties and obligations laid upon them. In no other way could they stand firm in God’s organization. W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In 1918 Jehovah shortened the trouble upon earth in order that his witnesses might proclaim his name. He sent them throughout the earth to do that work. Since 1922 there has been no letup of the work of witness to the name of Jehovah. That period of time has been “Christendom’s” chance to hear instruction from Almighty God to deport herself accordingly. In obedience to the Lord’s commandment his witnesses have been diligent and constant in carrying his message to the people of “Christendom”. Instead of hearing such message of information and warning from Jehovah and facing about and serving him, her religious leaders have continued to act in defiance of him and have persecuted and continue to persecute his faithful messengers. This they do because under the influence and power of the demons. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To the members of the body of Christ Jehovah is the blessed One. He is the strength of his faithful ones. The everlasting arm of Jehovah bears up his servants. Jehovah gives strength to those who love and serve him; as he declares: “The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.” (2 Chron. 16:9) In full harmony with Jehovah’s purpose the “faithful servant” class utter the prayer: “Jehovah . . . teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.” Jehovah’s witnesses pray this prayer, and they do everything in harmony with God’s will that they can do to perform that which the prayer calls upon them to do. That does not mean that they engage in physical combat in order to make known the Kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W10/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah rests or keeps silent from rebuking Zion, that being no longer necessary, because the children of Zion, the faithful remnant, are zealous and obedient to Jehovah’s commandments and are active, therefore, in his service. This is his attitude toward them because of his love for his faithful ones. All his acts toward them are by reason of his loving-kindness. Therefore he bids his people to sing, for now is the time for them to make manifest their joy in him. He joys over them with singing because the time has come to vindicate his name by his Theocratic Government. The time is here for the deliverance of his faithful ones, and they are commanded to sing. He communicates to them the “new song”, and they sing. At the birth of the man child Jesus the angelic host of heaven sang a prophetic song, and again that song is being fulfilled: “Glory to God!” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/40</span></p>

The faithful may confidently rely upon such deliverance. Therefore they will not now be discouraged by the increasing woes upon the world and the persecution upon themselves, but will lift up the head with gladness because there is overwhelming evidence that the day of deliverance is near. For his name’s sake Jehovah will save and deliver his faithful people. “He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation unto him [as represented by his faithful people on earth at Armageddon]; and his righteousness [the vindication of his name], it sustained him. For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head.”—Isa. 59:16, 17. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1/10</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is the fountain of life. No creature can live without God’s permission. The entire universe hangs on the life of Jehovah, the Almighty. Strange as it may seem, now the existence of God is at issue. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” The modern-day Moabites and Ammonites by their course of action deny the existence of Almighty God. Therefore in their heart (seat of motive) they say there is no God. Jehovah by his own life swears that he will bring all such opponents to an everlasting end. His eternal existence obligates the Almighty God to openly demonstrate to all creation that he is supreme. At Armageddon he will so demonstrate to all, that he is the living God, the self-existing One, the King of Eternity. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/40</span></p>

Those wicked spirit creatures were alive and active then, and even in the present day they are alive and active and do likewise deceive many who think they are serving God. The Devil used religion from the days of Nimrod to the days of the apostles, and in this very day the demons are unusually active, employing religion to turn the people away from God. It will be found from the Scriptures that the close-girdling or besetting sin of all who profess to serve God is the influence of demons brought to bear upon them by religion. In order to safeguard themselves they must be diligent to avoid religion and for safety they must follow closely the Word of God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/40</span></p>

Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to sound such warning that all other persons within hearing and who may hear and who are of good-will may flee to the place of safety. The trumpet is a sound of alarm. Jehovah’s faithful witnesses are now sounding the trumpet of Almighty God by proclaiming the approaching day of Armageddon. When the battle actually begins, the trumpet sound will announce the Lord charging upon the enemy, leading his invincible host, which host will be uttering the cry of victory. That will be the time of trumpetsounding and shouting against entrenched forces of wickedness, against those who have convinced themselves into believing they are secure.

Instead of turning to God and the plain instruction in His Word, worldly rulers turn wholly to the Devil and his associate demons and representatives, and proclaim, “We must have more religion, else our civilization will soon perish.” Thus they act as mouthpieces of these demons to force all people into religion, the Devil himself knowing such will end up in destruction.

He must gladly submit to the Lord’s judgments written long ago, and which judgments are now being pronounced. Those who seek meekness and find it must be the ones who are anxious to do God’s will. They hear the truth and then bring themselves into line with God’s judgment against demonism, that is, against all manner of religion and religious practices. They declare themselves on the side of The Theocratic Government. This must be done by those of good-will before receiving God’s favor. They must desire to be on his side.

(Job 42:10) At Armageddon Jehovah will fully deliver all who have faithfully served him from those who have persecuted them. While Satan’s servants are now being gathered together for destruction the gathering of Jehovah’s faithful servants is also taking place for their salvation. All who take their stand on the side of The Theocratic Government and continue to serve The Theocracy, under Christ Jesus, shall be completely delivered at Armageddon. Those who practice what they have called “Christian religion” will be first disposed of at Armageddon and then God’s servants will be fully delivered from them.

Thereby the Lord furnishes opportunity for the oppressed class of “prisoners” who are of good-will to hear and lay hold upon the Theocratic message and find the way to complete freedom.

That rising up was pictured by the battles of Perazim and Gibeon. That rising up in those battles was a witness to Jehovah’s name and served notice upon the enemies. God’s “strange work” is now about completed and the time for his “strange act” is about to begin. Armageddon will be a time of the exhibition of Jehovah’s supreme power and will be such a complete witness to all creation that none can have any doubt about the fact that Jehovah is acting. Religion and religionists have completely rejected Jehovah’s name and his kingdom, but the express purpose of the Most High is that all shall know that he is the Supreme One, “whose name alone is Jehovah.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/!/40</span></p>

The seeker for safety and life must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as his Redeemer or purchaser, not only of himself but of all those of good-will toward God. The promise of God is salvation to such. The seeker must then exercise faith in God and Christ Jesus by fully agreeing to do God’s will concerning him. That is consecration. Then he must carry out that agreement by studying to show himself approved to God, and not to men. That means to study God’s Word and the helps he has provided to understanding his Word. He must devote himself to God and his kingdom and be diligent to learn what God’s Word discloses all such must do. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W11/1/40</span></p>

God made such provision by sending Christ Jesus into the world to save those who believe on Jesus, who, as God’s representative, gives life to those who do believe and obey the commandments of Almighty God. Man must hear of and learn of God’s provision for salvation, and thus the way is open for man to determine his own end or destiny. Those who do hear and obey receive life; those who refuse to believe and obey remain under condemnation and perish for ever. Belief on and obedience to Christ Jesus are therefore conditions precedent to receiving life as a free gift. Before it can become effective the receiver must be willing to accept that gift.

Salvation or deliverance was foreshadowed by what came to David and his companions. At Armageddon salvation and deliverance will come to the anointed remnant and their companions, at which time all the enemies will be destroyed, down to the lowest earthly member of the Devil’s organization. Jehovah, by Christ Jesus, will exercise his almighty power against the enemy, proving that Jehovah is supreme, and this will follow immediately after the completion of the proclamation of Jehovah’s name and kingdom in the earth (Ex. 9:16) and suddenly when the proclamation of “peace and safety” is made by the religious head of Satan’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1/40</span></p>

Privileges wasted and let to slip by unused are gone. Now what is to be done to buy back time or recover from such lost opportunities must be done quickly. No time to waste. Those who have walked in obedience to God, having been diligent to hear and obey his commandments, are strongly contrasted with those who have been negligent, indifferent, and who have failed to take advantage of opportunities to show their love for God and his kingdom.

It will be marked by peculiar sounds, or awesome noises, accompanied by the operation of the supreme power of the Almighty moving to the destruction of his enemies. Thus is indicated that the battle will be accompanied by the victorious shouts of the heavenly or invisible host, and by songs of praise to Jehovah, sung by his faithful servants on the earth. In contrast to such joyful sounds there will be the eries of confusion, terror, gr' 2f, disappointment and utter dismay on the part of those who have followed religious leaders and who have refused to give heed to the instruction set forth in the Word of God.

<p><span class="font5">To carry his knife on his right thigh and draw it with his left hand was contrary to practice amongst fighters. Likewise religious oppressors and allies have regarded Jehovah’s witnesses as a religious sect and have expected them to fight according to the religious manner, according to traditions of men, and not according to God’s Word. Ehud girded his sword under his raiment. His raiment identified him as a servant, and the knife on his right thigh pictured him as a warrior. Thus he represented Christ Jesus, God’s servant and great Warrior. Likewise the message of truth is concealed from religionists, in that they are blind to Jehovah’s purposes. They have looked on the wrong side for the truth. They follow traditions, hence do not discern the “sword of the spirit”, the meaning of God’s Word.

This spiritual spoiling snatches the people of good-will from the power and control of the modern-day Moabites and Ammonites.

As stated by Daniel (12:4), their eyes are running to and fro searching out what is contained in God’s Word for their instruction and comfort.

Even though the enemy challenges the legality of the witness work and heaps great reproach and punishment upon those engaged in that work, the faithful must not slack their hand. No one in Zion must fear the enemy. They must be bold as the lion, which represents justice. They must joyfully continue to obey the Lord’s commandments. God is our strength, and him only shall we fear. Jehovah’s witnesses must be diligent and very active up until Armageddon, ever rejoicing in their privilege of bearing reproaches that fell on the Lord for His name’s sake. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Held under the influence of the demons and being under a strong delusion, they conclude that God is on their side, and therefore have pushed on their campaign to suppress the Theocratic message and the messengers. When they have, as they believe, accomplished that fact, then is the time they cry out “Peace and safety”. Thereby they mean that religionists and totalitarian rulers are at peace with God and have suppressed the advocates of The Theocracy and that they, the religionists and allies, are enjoying peace and are safe from further hearing the sound concerning the doom of “Christendom”. They believe they have put Jehovah’s witnesses in a place where they can no longer do harm to the religionists and totalitarian rule. They have shut down completely on their freedom of action.

<p><span class="font5">In preparation for the exhibition of his supreme power the Lord gathers his faithful people from many nations. The “remnant” come supplicating Jehovah and offering to him their praise and service in righteousness. Modern-day Ethiopians, pictured by Ebed-meleeh, come to the remnant and join in the praise of Jehovah. The Lord God removes all cause for shame and fear on their part by clearing out from them the proud, the character-developers, the creatureworshipers, and the devotees to religion. The faithful servants completely renounce religion or demonism. Under the direction of Christ Jesus the King they go forth proclaiming The Theocratic Government. In this they slack not the hand, but go on courageously until the “strange work” is completed and the “strange act” begins. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/iO</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Abstain from sleepy dullness and be on the lookout for the Kingdom interests and for the enemy’s resistance at all times Drunkenness, resulting from wine of Satan’s policy, brings on a stupor. Avoid such. Drink freely of the wine (that is, the joy of the Lord) new in the Kingdom. Rejoice that we are privileged to be on the Lord’s side, fighting for The Theocracy. That wine does not produce stupor, but sharpens the outlook of God’s people and thrills the heart. It enables us to appreciate the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The light of this day of the Lord is too bright to permit anyone of the faithful to do wrong particularly toward his fellow Christians and get away with it. The Lord looks upon the motive, that is, upon the heart. To be sober means to be calm, and keenly awake, serious-minded, steady, very courageous, and fully trusting in the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1 /£0</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Bible truths furnish the key which now unlocks the doors and discloses religion’s deeds of wickedness, and these are discerned by the people who have a desire to learn the truth. The Lord is now opening the door to all sincere persons that such may see the duplicity and wickedness of the religious systems. Other scriptures show that God will cause servants and allies of the Hierarchy to see and understand the hypocritical action of big religious systems, and that then action against that element of Satan’s organization will take place. (Rev. 17:16, 17) Thus God permits their eyes to be opened to fulfill his purpose. Then the radical element takes action. God makes them to understand what a wicked, hypocritical institution the great religious system is. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/4.0</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Amariah” means “said by Jehovah”, or, “whom Jehovah said (that is, promised).” Jehovah has said or designated the remnant on earth as his visible mouthpiece to declare what things He has said or promised, as published in his Word. These faithful witnesses never take credit to themselves, but always refer to their authority, to wit, “Thus saith Jehovah.” They publish God’s Word, not the word of any man. Therefore the meaning of the name Amariah well fits the course such faithful witnesses take. “Hizkiah,” or “Hezekiah”, means “strength of Jehovah”. The remnant have no strength within themselves, but are “strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might”. The words of Psalm 18:1 exactly apply to them: “I will love thee, 0 Lord, my strength.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/1^0</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And Deborah a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.—Judg. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many scriptures show that a woman is used to picture Jehovah’s organization. It was so with Deborah. Her name means </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“bee”,</span><span class="font5"> that is, a swarm, or swarmers. Bees are very energetic and wise in defense. When bees attack they go in a well-organized body, led by one. The bee is not only a symbol of sweetness and noted for its honey, but particularly noted for organized action and work and especially in united assaults upon opposers. (Deut. 1:44; Ps. 118:12) Thus is well pictured how God’s organization acts in full and complete unity. Deborah, true to name, put forth her efforts in due time to cause the Israelites to swarm like bees against their oppressors. She was a prophetess raised up of the Lord, as such, not to “usurp authority over the man”, but to picture God’s organization, to foretell what God in his due time will do by and through his organization.

<p><span class="font5">Worldly-wise men who have relied upon their own building of so-called “civilization” have laid up on earth treasures by which they hope to protect and save themselves. Thus they have heaped up their treasures for the days of evil as a kind of insurance against disaster. No amount of money or other treasure can serve to bribe Jehovah and his great Executive Officer, Christ Jesus. No amount of accumulated earthly treasure “shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s wrath”. The Almighty God will receive nothing as pay to keep that hypocritical crowd out of the shambles and to save them from destruction. The “city of refuge”, God’s organization, is the only place of security and safety. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The name “Barak” means “lightning”. So far in these modern days the Devil, the mimic god, acting through his earthly agency, the Vatican and the Nazis, speaks of their vicious assaults upon others as a “Blitzkrieg” or lightning war. That war of the Devil’s representatives will avail nothing in the end. Barak pictured Christ Jesus, who appears in two relations: (1) As captain of God’s faithful witnesses engaged in God’s “strange work”; and (2) as Field Marshal of Jehovah leading his hosts in the battle of that great day of God Almighty in the accomplishment of his “strange act”. All the enemy will be in darkness and only the Lord will cause the light to shine and “his arrow shall go forth as the lightning”, smiting the terrified enemy.—Zech. 9:14.

(Mark 13:14) Jehovah through Christ Jesus will completely oust all of them. Then the meek Judeans, that is, those who truly serve and praise Jehovah, will inherit the earth. Almighty God created the earth as a permanent place to be occupied by righteous men. The enemy having been completely destroyed and thereby deprived of its possession at Armageddon, then the righteous ones shall come into their own. The “faithful princes” will then be on the earth. Those who fled to the “city of refuge” will be there. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">According to facts there is but a small number of people who have and exercise full faith in the Lord and who now believe God will fully avenge his own people in his own due time. (Luke 18:7, 8) To have such faith one must now see that the Theocratic Government of Jehovah under Christ Jesus is the only bulwark againsr religion and associated wickedness and that The Theocracy is the only hope of deliverance of the people to life. And then such must recognize that God is now permitting the Devil and his agents on earth, particularly leaders in religion, to have full opportunity to show their enmity against The Theocracy and its supporters, and that the wicked persecution of Jehovah's servants is to permit them to prove their own integrity. Seeing this, the faithful ones are not at all discouraged, but are rather encouraged. They see Armageddon is near. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/il</span></p>

Those who survive Armageddon will not forget what God has done to the modern Moabites and Ammonites. “And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; and I will declare thy greatness.” (Ps. 145:6) Jehovah’s battle against the enemy will be so terrible that it will cause all survivors beholding it to be afraid and tremble. Those who receive God’s favor cannot divide their service or devotion by giving to others some part thereof. He is the Almighty, the Most High, the Giver of life, and those creatures who oppose him and exalt themselves as gods shall perish “For the Lord most high is terrible.”—Ps. 47: 2. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/iO</span></p>

It shows that the delivery of the message of truth by Jehovah’s witnesses is not of their making or choice, but that the deadly message is “the sword of the spirit”, which exposes to the view of all the wickedness of religious institutions, and this in order that the people may see that their only means of escape and salvation is to flee to Jehovah and Christ. Men of God feed upon the Word of God. But as for religionists, His Word is deadly, striking such institutions in the vitals and cutting them in every direction.

Away with you! We have the Bible; we do as we like.” They have no excuse for being ignorant of what the Scriptures contain. They could have received the knowledge of the truth and faithfully imparted it to others, and this they have not done. Instead of appreciating such instruction from the Lord religionists, particularly “Christendom”, refuse to hear. The leaders in her see only the frail servants of God, who have brought to them God’s message, and they vent their spleen upon these creatures rather than give heed to words of the Lord set forth in the Bible.

They do not have to be drafted, nor do they complain or murmur concerning the hours they have to work after entering the field of action. They know where they are going, and delight to do what is commanded of them. Barak and Deborah went up to Mount Tabor together; which pictures Christ Jesus in charge of Jehovah’s organization engaging in his “strange work” on earth against demonism or religion. Ten thousand went up with them, and this pictured completely a number of the remnant on earth, all enlisted for The Theocracy.

The apparel they wear is provided by the Devil, like the vestments worn by the princes of Baal when Jehu slew them. Such men don the uniform that is strange or foreign to God and identify themselves as a part of Satan’s organization and as those who uphold it. The official apparel of the clergy or Hierarchy is very strange. It makes the wearers thereof very conspicuous among men, by which such wearers claim to be “more holy” than others.

The battle of the great day of God Almighty will be fought by Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, supported by all the holy angels of heaven, pitted against the Devil and other demons and their supporters on earth who continue on the side of the wicked ones. All the nations come to the same end, because all are on the wrong side, that is, on the losing side. All such nations are against The Theocratic Government, the kingdom of the Almighty God.

<p><span class="font5">The enemies have cruelly persecuted Jehovah’s faithful servants and have shed much blood of the innocent and faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Jehovah gives his unbreakable word that at Armageddon he will square the account with all such. This he will do by pouring out the blood of the enemies as dust and strewing about their flesh upon the earth even “as the dung”. They treat God’s Word with utter contempt and heap great contempt upon Jehovah’s witnesses. As “Christendom” shows her rebellion against God and his kingdom, so Jehovah shall treat them as rebels at Armageddon. He will show his contempt for “Christendom” and her leaders and supporters. Their flesh shall be strewn upon the earth as a contemptible thing. The survivors of Armageddon shall see them. No resurrection for such.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has definitely fixed the time for the battle of Armageddon. “Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world.” (Acts 15:18) Is there any man on earth who knows the exact date for the beginning of “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”? “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.” (Matt. 24: 35, 36) For many centuries Jehovah has made known that there is a time coming when his great wrath will be expressed against all of Satan’s organization. Those diligent to know and do God’s will have received comfort from his revealed Word. Those who believe in God and his King and who seek righteousness and meekness clearly discern that the great climax is very near. For such sincere and devoted people Jehovah has provided consolation.

<p><span class="font5">The day of preparation for Armageddon has been in progress for some time. There is now a short period of grace until the battle. God has shortened the day of tribulation and afforded time and opportunity for his warning to be sounded. Armageddon is very near. “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” When the day of Jehovah’s anger in its fierceness breaks, then it will be too late to flee to the place of safety, therefore too late to give consideration to the warning God sends by his prophet Zephaniah. Armageddon is a time of destruction, and not a time to begin to hear and obey the Lord’s commandments. There will be no escape for those who have disregarded the warning of Jehovah.

For this the servants of God are grateful to him, that he makes it possible for them to continue for a time in proclaiming the Theocratic message. It is entirely proper, and therefore must be according to God’s will, that his servants take advantage of the just and righteous laws of the land to prevent the shutting down of their work and service unfil God’s due time for it to end. Thus the servants of the religious element, engaged in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses, are prevented from stopping God’s “strange work” until his due time.

Those people of good-will who now flee to the “city of refuge”, Jehovah’s organization under Christ. The faithful servants of God now have a vision by faith of what is shortly to come to pass. The battle of that great day of God Almighty will leave none of the wicked. Only those who have served God and his King shall survive. Until the time after the dead bodies and bones shall be removed or buried, as prophesied at Ezekiel 39:9-15, the desolate places will be occupied only by wild beasts that have participated in slaying the wicked by God’s command.

<p><span class="font5">In “Christendom’s” approaching great trouble as travail of a woman giving birth, “Christendom” will not be saved out of that, but shall die with no possible hope of being ever revived. When Armageddon begins the cries of those who have opposed The Theocracy will be like the travail of a woman in the death throes. At Armageddon there will be no “twilight sleep” to benumb “Christendom’s” pains giving birth to what she had hoped to be her own government. Her pain will end in her complete destruction. Her degeneracy will make her pains all the more intense. When religionists begin to sing, felicitate and hail each other as having accomplished their purpose, sudden destruction falls upon them from the Lord’s hand, and by no means ean they possibly escape.

Just before Armageddon he puts forth a desperate effort to turn all the people against Jehovah, and for this purpose he employs the totalitarian methods first put in operation through Nimrod, to completely carry out unity of action against The Theocratic Government. Thereupon God gathers to himself his own people and brings them into full unity, and gives them his message, that they may all speak the truth while the opposers of The Theocratic Government rush madly on to destruction. Within the day of Jehovah he turns to his people, the remnant and their companions, “a pure lip,” a lip that gives praise to and glorifies the name of the great Theoerat, and his government of righteousness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Only a few places now remain where the message of The Theocratic Government can be proclaimed. This is not because God is not all-powerful, but because he is permitting the enemy to carry out exactly what He foretold centuries ago. When religionists and totalitarian allies have fully succeeded in suppressing the Theocratic message throughout the English-speaking part of the earth, then, it is to be expected, the religious leaders will cry out, “Peace and safety?’ The religious, totalitarian alliance are trying to convince themselves even that they are safe and no destruction shall come upon them. Jehovah, through his prophet (Isa. 28:15), long ago foretold what they would do and say. In answer thereto Jehovah says: “Your covenant with death shall be disannulled.” Only those wholly devoted to Jehovah and his government under Christ and who stand firm in support of The Theocracy will be safe.

The religionists watched for opportunities to rid the earth of God’s consecrated people, but the Lord saved and delivered those who were faithful to him. God had permitted them to be driven out of the “Holy Land” of the service, which was denied God’s people in behalf of the Kingdom interests during the World War, because of their fear of man and because of holding to much of religion and religious ceremonies.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The great day of the Lord is ... a day of wasteness and desolation.—Zeph. 1:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That day will not be one of ease and comfort and plenty. Jehovah’s witnesses now by faith see that this great prophecy concerning the trouble is near fulfillment, and until its fulfillment they must keep on sounding the warning and pointing the people to God’s organization as the only place of safety. That responsibility is laid upon the faithful, which they cannot escape and at the same time receive God’s approval. Not even the faithful are told the exact day and hour that the great trouble will break, but they do see that it is soon. Distress upon the world increases, the way of the witnesses becomes more difficult, they must continue to give witness, and they cry unto the Lord: &quot;How long<sup>5</sup>’ must they continue the witness work? And they get the answer (Isaiah 6:11): “Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Saul’s Edomite herdsman, Doeg, whose name means “fearful”, spied upon David and gave information to be used to David’s destruction. Likewise the modernday Saul class have spies who seek for information to bring about the destruction of God’s faithful servants. Such spies mingle with them, pretend to be friendly, and do this in order to find something that might be used against the faithful. Such spies, like Doeg, are “fearful” of men, but do not fear God. They are led to do things in the presence of other men which they think might bring to them praise and approval. Such spies serve the Devil for selfish gain and are held to their leaders of the Saul class by ties of religion. All such God will destroy.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah takes full notice of the reviling of his people by the Ammonites of modern days, that is, the political element, which works with the religionists for political gain. The totalitarians are now determined to rule the world or to bring about the destruction of the nations. They get their inspiration, of course, from the Devil by and through the religious element, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. None of these like the message of God, because it discloses that The Theocracy shall rule the whole world in righteousness and that the totalitarian rule shall soon for ever cease. Those politicians join forces with the Hierarchy to destroy Jehovah’s servants and to prevent the spreading of the Kingdom gospel. At Armageddon they will not be <sup>&lt;c</sup>hid”.

<p><span class="font5">The meek are those who sincerely desire to be taught righteousness and who are anxious to walk in the right way. They must be meek, as Moses was meek, and cry to the Lord for help. (Num. 12:1-3) The meek will be diligent to seek knowledge and understanding and to be guided by the Lord’s Word, and will not be resisting his instruction. They will be not only willing but glad to know of the good news concerning The Theocratic Government. (Isa. 61:1) That means to have a desire to be beautified by the Lord’s salvation. The meek seek Jehovah now. They desire to see righteousness which comes only from the Lord: “The Lord lifteth up the meek; he casteth the wicked down to the ground.” (Ps. 147:6) None but the meek will now receive satisfaction and joy. “The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise the Lord that seek him.” —Ps. 22:26. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chemarim</span><span class="font5"> means those who go about in black, hence ascetics, priests of a religious organization, and such as the nuns, who collect the money from the ensnared ones. Faithfully this description fits the “blackbirds” of ecclesiastieism, the gloomy groups of priests and preachers and others of today; also the “evil servant” class. All such mark themselves in order to be seen, recognized and approved by men. In the prophecy the “priests” are those who lead in religion, particularly so-called “Christian religion”. Even now the name and titles of such begin to go, as the people are learning that religion is hypocrisy in the extreme. The people of good-will are becoming enlightened and are shunning religion and their religious leaders. At the beginning of Armageddon everything pertaining to such religious, hypocritical practice will be taken away by the Lord. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Israelites were not equipped to meet the enemy on equal terms. Only Jehovah could deliver them. Today religionists, led by the Hierarchy and fully supported by totalitarian armies, have all the weapons of oppression and use them against all who support The Theocracy. Only Jehovah our God, by Christ Jesus, can deliver his people, and those really devoted to him have full assurance that he will deliver them in his own due time. Against all the cruel persecution Jehovah’s servants have been practically powerless. True, they have taken advantage of their rights to defend themselves in courts and otherwise, but with small results. They suffer persecution for righteousness’ sake, the sake of Jehovah’s name and kingdom, and they have his full assurance that he will avenge them in his due time and in his own good way.

<p><span class="font5">Spiritual Israelites, although surrounded by the organization of Satan, have no part in his wicked organization. Ethiopia, therefore, here represents the Devil’s organization, out from which some of God’s people are gathered. By the hand of Moses God gathered his chosen people out of Egypt and from her allies, including Ethiopia. The time comes for God to gather his spiritual chosen people out from the Devil’s organization. The people that are anxious to see and enter into the righteous government are gathered to the Lord. The work performed by the Lord’s witnesses has to do with the gathering. Those who are opposed to The Theocracy are gathered for destruction. Spiritual Israelites scattered about the nations are gathered unto the Lord in unity. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The valiant ones amongst the mighty men are those who make war and then cry for peace and assume the responsibility and honor of bringing about peace. Concerning them the Lord says: ‘The mighty men cry there bitterly’ when they see their efforts have failed. (Zeph. 1:14) Men who now think the world has builded a civilization that shall stand forever by reason of their own efforts to bring about peace and prosperity will be wholly disappointed. Mighty commercial men, who transact the world’s commerce, and all their pilots amongst the people, shall get theirs, and they shall weep. All such, seeing their efforts are in vain, will cry as Esau cried, but, like Esau, will receive no help. The mighty men take no heed to the warning today given, but in anger persecute the humble messengers of Jehovah that bring to them God’s warning. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/40</span></p>

They will come from all nations. All such Jehovah will bring into the temple courts and put them in touch with the remnant of the temple company yet on earth, and therefore such persons will form the “great multitude” and serve Jehovah at his temple. Such true worshipers and true worship will not be confined to only one nation or a few nations, but there shall be some from all, “even all the isles of the heathen [nations].” Testimony to the name of the great Theo-crat and his government under Christ is now being carried to the various nations, and the “great multitude” is being manifested.

One who is instructed by the Lord and receives knowledge has an appreciation of his relationship to Jehovah and to his King. (Prov. 9:10) As his faithful remnant continue to obey God’s commandments he continues to instruct them by revealing to them the meaning of his prophecies. In this time the Lord gathers his “other sheep”, and these are made companions of the remnant and joined with the remnant in declaring The Theocratic Government and in sounding warning that final judgment is about to be fully executed. The wise heed the warning, receive the instructions and immediately flee to The Theocratic Government and have promise of being hidden there.

Why? “It may be,” or, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew)</span><span class="font5"> “Who knows whether or not ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger?” That is, there is no other way of escape to a safe hiding place, and if one will comply with the divine rule he may be led into that place of safety. God’s enemies try to hide themselves, but the religious leaders of the Hierarchy and others will be sorely disappointed. Their human fortifications will quickly crumble and all human hide-outs will be entirely in vain. God provides the only place of safety.

It means the “evil servant” class, also the leaders who teach religion in this day of Jehovah, and all who induce the people to practice religion or demonism. All inhabitants of “Christendom” who remain under the leadership of the religious combine and everyone who gives aid and comfort to the Devil’s organization are also included in that destructive judgment. The judgment of execution will not be delayed. When Jehovah’s time comes execution will take place speedily. The demon-worshipers will have fully identified themselves by that time.

Today they reproach and oppress his witnesses and their companions in a way more cruel than at any time past, without excuse or cause. Throughout all the earth religious leaders oppress Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions and attempt to deprive them of all lawful rights and privileges and to hinder them from carrying the Kingdom message to those who desire to hear. They even denounce them before the other governing factors, denying the individual rights of men to worship Almighty God as he has commanded. All the facts show that the religionists, that is, unfaithful “Christendom”, are both filthy and an oppressive organization.

The &quot;breastplate” symbolizes the heart condition, which means an unqualified devotion to Jehovah. The great fight is about to take place, and the faithful must be equipped. Put on “for an helmet, the hope of salvation”. Be sure that the mind is fed upon the Word of God as he now reveals the meaning thereof to those who love him. “Study to shew thyself approved unto God.” (2 Tim. 2:15) Confidently rely upon the Lord God, with full expectation that he is certain to deliver those who love him; therefore let the heart rejoice in his salvation. —Ps. 13: 5. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5"> P/l/40</span></p>

In chapter one of Zephaniah’s prophecy God’s decree is summed up. There Jehovah makes known his definite purpose of wiping out unfaithful Judah and Jerusalem. The prophecy was recorded, and its meaning is now made known for the benefit of those on earth when God, speaking from the temple, commands all to keep silent and hear. (Hab. 2:20) All within the borders of “Christendom” are commanded to hear, because Jehovah’s decree is about to be executed.

Religionists are under the influence and power of the demons, whether they know it or not.

Always have in mind that there is but one place of safety, and that is in or under Christ Jesus, who is the head of Jehovah’s capital organization, which organization furnishes protection to those who flee to the Lord at this time.

All these things are iniquitous in the Lord’s sight; which must be cleared out. From and after such cleansing God’s &quot;remnant” must keep clean and free from lawlessness.

Similar persecution began against Christ Jesus, the Greater David, immediately following his anointing. Like persecution has been heaped upon God’s anointed people especially since A.D. 1922. Saul was the one to whom David refers as “my strong enemy”. This prophetic picture made long ago is being fulfilled in this day, and Psalm 18:17 specifically refers to the deliverance of the antitypical David class from the antitypical Saul class, “my strong enemy.” God’s anointed people now appreciate the danger in which they are placed, and by faith they adopt and utter the words that David uttered above.

The Assyrians’ action against unfaithful Israel, however, was taken out of malice and in defiance of Jehovah God and at the instance of the Devil, the Devil’s purpose being to carry out his challenge and boast that Jehovah is impotent and inferior to the demon gods, and to thereby bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name.

Their work is purely to publish the truth, that men may know the right way to go. As followers of Christ Jesus they must publish the truth, and do so. It would not be reasonable to expect them to be in any other class than of the ones persecuted as Jesus and the apostles were. Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions love righteousness and hate iniquity, and in the heart of each is written the law of God. Therefore they do not fear the reproach of men, neither do they fear the Devil and his wicked supporters. They fear Jehovah. Seeing that he has promised them life everlasting, they fear that they might come short of the performance of their covenant with him and fail to receive that which is promised.

Then the clearing out of “elective elder” bosses of the companies was another revelation that brought joy to the faithful. In 1938 Jehovah revealed that the democratic system of government is not the rule for Jehovah’s organization, but that God’s organization is necessarily theocratic. He revealed that “the king of [spiritual] Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee”.

The book of The Revelation tells that the destruction of Babylon is the coming event of surpassing interest both in heaven and in earth, the destruction of which refers to the complete fall of Satan’s organization, and not to the literal earth. The destruction of Babylon means the final end of the wicked world over which Satan and his demons have ruled, and which destruction will immediately follow the completion of the proclamation of Jehovah’s name and his kingdom, which work is now in progress in the earth.

Prisons and concentration camps have in recent months become places of torture of Jehovah’s witnesses and others. All such imprisonment and torture results from demon influence and power exercised over people by the practitioners of religion. Religion is the snare of the Devil, in which to catch the people, and the racket of the religious leaders to rob the people. All practitioners of religion, and the adherents thereto, will find no place of safety or escape at Armageddon.

The stronghold of “Christendom”, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which now claims to be a hiding place for the religionists and allies, cannot hide anyone from God’s wrath. Ashkelon, another Philistine city, also pictured the organization of “Christendom”, which will be completely ruined by the Lord at Armageddon, .and none of the enemy shall be hid therefrom.

<p><span class="font5">Particularly after 1922, when the witness work took on an increased fillip or greater energy, the remnant of spiritual Israel was gathered. Prior to that spiritual Israel had transgressed because of fear, and also still held to some religious practices, which they had brought with them out of Babylon. Jehovah then cleansed the temple class by his great Refiner. (Dan. 8:14; Mal. 3:1-4) The proud and haughty among Christ’s professed followers were taken away from the faithful, obedient ones by means of revealing to the faithful the truths then due: “Light is sown for the righteous”; and thereafter such began to walk in the increased light and vigorously engaged in the witness work.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saith Jehovah ... I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place.—Zeph. 1:3,4, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All kinds of religion dishonor God, and all are against his kingdom by Christ Jesus. This proves that the real fight now is, Satan and all other elements of his organization aligned against The Theocracy by Christ Jesus. Among the many professors of Christianity, Baalism or religion still persists. It openly claims its friendship to and with the world, which is Satan’s organization, and Satan is the great Baal, lord, owner and husband of that organization. Practitioners of religion not only turn away from the truth, but openly oppose God’s organization and persecute those who bring His message to their attention. In “Christendom” the religionists continue to worship with great admiration the religions of Satan, and these leaders urge upon the rising generation to embrace the same, and thus all are marching into the pit of destruction. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">After Armageddon begins there will be multitudinous numbers outside of the “city of refuge” because they have held to demonism or religion. Because of support given to the Devil’s bloody organization they will not be permitted then to plead ignorance of their responsibility. Now the responsibility is upon Jehovah’s witnesses and servants to take the Kingdom message to all such and sound it within their hearing, even though they cannot induce the obstinate to hear and obey. The responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses is to proclaim the truth, and this they cannot avoid. God will make a clean-up of all the enemy and supporters of the Devil; and those who refuse to give heed to the warning now being proclaimed and who persist in their service of demonism and yielding to the influence of demonism, shall die and will bear the responsibility upon their own heads.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.-Isa. 43:10, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No man was the founder of Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah God alone is the founder of Jehovah’s witnesses. Christ Jesus is his “Faithful and True Witness” and is the chief witness of the Most High, and all the members of “his body” are witnesses of Jehovah. From Abel to John the Baptist the faithful servants of the Most High God were witnesses of Jehovah. The true followers of Christ do not follow or worship any man, nor do they regard any man as founder or leader of God’s organization. Christ Jesus is the Head of Jehovah’s capital organization, and is the duly appointed, anointed chief and leader of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is contrary to God’s will that men be worshiped. The true followers of Christ Jesus are wholly and completely devoted to the great Theocrat, Jehovah, and to his King, and no human creature or thing do they worship.

<p><span class="font5">The religionists, and the leaders thereof particularly, appear to think they are everlastingly fixed and settled down. They have not, as the wine is, “been emptied from vessel to vessel.” They have long been left undisturbed. The time has come when the Lord visits them and stirs them up, causing their vile and impure settlings to rise up and spoil the taste, and that upsets their “thickened” or hardened, self-complacent condition. They desire to stay right where they are, and object to having their religious susceptibilities disturbed. When the light of God’s Word is brought to their attention it disturbs them, particularly when the truth is declared to Catholic practitioners and interests the “children” of the organization who are of good-will toward God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I will triumph in the works of thy hands.—Ps. 92:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The commercial and political parts of Satan’s organization are supported by the military and strong-arm squad. All these have joined with the religionists for the purpose of doing violence to Jehovah’s servants. Their action shall not be passed over unnoticed by Jehovah, but he will recompense them shortly. Upon those adversaries disgrace and destruction shall come as upon the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. That punishment will be a just recompense for their selfglory and pride and arrogance in wrongfully claiming what belongs to Jehovah alone. God’s faithful servants shall finally triumph. They that worship God shall fill the whole earth. Worshipers of demons and men will cease for ever. That instruction now comforts the people of God and makes their hope strong that they may move forward in the work that God has assigned to them.

Those “who are of thee”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> “From thee had they been.” These consecrated ones had been absent from the Lord’s organization because of being in captivity or prisoners or restrained ones, held by the enemy organization during the World War. It was a burden to them to be in captivity: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“A </span><span class="font5">burden on thee [and] a reproach!” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> The consecrated had not maintained their integrity, but had slacked their hands during that period in giving testimony of the Kingdom. Thus in 1918 and 1919 they had contributed to the reproach upon Jehovah’s organization. Those who were in the “evil servant” class were not gathered after 1918, but were 'cut off from the holy city’, as stated at Zechariah 14:1, 2. The faithful were sorrowful, and when they were regathered to the Lord their joy really began. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.—1 Thess. 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The anointed and faithful witnesses of Jehovah God know what God reveals to them. They do not follow some man’s teaching. They know that they are the children of God and that their teachers are Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. When the apostle uses the positive words “Ye yourselves know”, it implies that those addressed discern the signs, or physical facts, now before them and which constitute a fulfillment of the prophecy, and this favor has come to them because the Lord has opened their eyes of understanding or discernment and given them a vision of Jehovah’s purpose. Such faithful ones give thanks and praise to God, and not to any man, for such enlightenment. If they gave honor and praise to men for such enlightenment they would be practicing idolatry and, of course, would go into darkness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The raising up of Ehud, the deliverer of natural Israel, foreshadowed the sending of Christ Jesus, the Deliverer of the faithful spiritual Israelites, to the temple to deliver these faithful ones from the cruel, political “Christendom”, which practices religion for gain. Ehud was the son of Gera. That name means “grain”, as a weight or measure of money. It denoted something very small so far as purchasing power was concerned. Ehud’s father was of little value or worth in the eyes of religionists; likewise Jehovah is of little worth in their eyes. Today his witnesses are also counted of little value or worth. Religionists ignore the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses have existed on the earth at all times for six thousand years and that God himself gives them that name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The day of vengeance is in mine heart.—Isa. 63:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the God of light, and his light is sown for the faithful servants of The Theocracy. His light is now shining into the mind of each one of those who wholly devotes himself to God and his kingdom. Jehovah is revealing his purpose to very soon “avenge the blood of his servants” and “render vengeance to his adversaries” and to make manifest his mercy and bless all of his people. “Vengeance” means, primarily, vindication. The great issue for determination is Jehovah’s supremacy, and hence the vindication of his name. Execution of vengeance necessarily means the punishment of all enemies of God by completely wiping them out, which will take place at Armageddon. Preparation has been in progress for some time for that battle. It is certain to be fought in the very near future. That will be the end of wickedness in the earth, and that “end shall be at the time appointed”. —Dan. 11: 27. W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah.—Zeph. 1:17, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The self-constituted wise men ignore everything God has given to his people and everything that godly men have proclaimed in their presence. These wicked ones have committed the “sin unto death”, and that beyond the hope of resurrection. The “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” has certainly done this very thing. All such have sinned against the Lord, since 1918 particularly. How? By their open hostility to Jehovah’s message, which he has sent amongst them by his obedient and faithful messengers ;and by their contemptuous indifference and unconcern toward that message relative to God and his kingdom, and which they have regarded as of no worth to them. They have preferred to hold to demonism or religion, saying, “That is good enough for us.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. And he said unto them, Follow after me.—Judg. 3:27,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All those who have taken their stand on the side of The Theocracy, and who continue faithful, will follow Christ Jesus in full confidence. If in doing so some are put to death they have the assurance that their full faith and devotion will be rewarded by a resurrection to life forevermore. The faithful cannot and will not fear and will not for one moment compromise with the enemy. They have made the great Jehovah God their fear. By his grace they will now prove their full faith and devotion to him and his King, and will thus maintain their integrity to the end. Armageddon is very near. The darkest hour of all time will soon give way to the most brilliant light that has ever come to humankind. This will be the reward of those who trust Jehovah and his King and remain true and steadfast to the end. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Eglon was a very fat man. And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.—Judg. 3:17,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ehud’s sword was a symbol of the divine message which carries the announcement of judgment of death rendered by Jehovah against the oppressive, defamatory religious organization. The published message from 1936 onward particularly sets forth his death judgment against that great religious institution, which has long blinded the people, held them prisoners and kept them away from the truth. The totalitarian monster, of which the Boman Catholic Hierarchy is the religious top-rider, received the proclamation of Jehovah’s judgment of death. God’s people told them that their end is destruction. As Ehud’s sword drove home, so likewise the antitypical sword struck the Satanic institution in the middle of the &quot;very fat man”.

<p><span class="font5">All who have become God’s witnesses were ‘born in sin’, hence sin-blackened, and “were by nature the children of wrath, even as others”. (Eph. 2:3) After being spirit-begotten the improper course of such brought upon them defilements during the World War and caused them to receive Jehovah’s disapproval, and hence caused them confusion. The name “Cushi” (confusion) well describes God’s people immediately preceding the time when the Lord came to the temple. The name “Gedaliah” means “whom Jehovah has made great (or powerful)”. This meaning well applies to Jehovah’s faithful remnant after they were released from Babylon in A.D. 1919. (Ps. 126: 2, 3) The Lord has made his people his witnesses of power since 1918 to deliver his message against the entrenched forces of Babylon. God’s message, which his witnesses have delivered since that time, has exhibited a powerful force and influence against religion and hypocrisy.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This means that the commercial religionists will find no protection in the day of Armageddon. They shall not be hid from God’s anger. Their wealth and influence and power among men will avail them nothing. “The nation of the Cherethites” means the men or organization of violence, that is, those of the world who use religion and the “absolution” which they receive from religionists, to further carry on their schemes of robbery and violence. These look to religious leaders to save them, but the religious leaders will not be able to help them at all. The Cherethites act at the Hierarchy’s bidding and willingly mistreat and heap violence upon Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rejoice evermore.—1 Thess. 5:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today as God’s faithful servants by faith see what shall shortly come to pass they have much cause to sing for joy. Even while the totalitarian spirit of demonism sweeps over the nations Christ’s faithful followers rejoice because they know what will be the result. What is now taking place in the governments ruled by dictators may soon come to pass in Great Britain and America. Even though this does come to pass God’s faithful servants will not be in the least deterred from doing the work he has committed into their hands. Wicked deeds of religionists and allies will not discourage the faithful, because they know what will be the final result. The confidence of these faithful ones is now strong because they trust wholly in Jehovah and his King. By their action and their countenances they say: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”—Ps. 13: 5. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Persecutors, including the Hierarchy and public officials, well know that Jehovah’s witnesses are harmless. They are not afraid of any harm that Jehovah’s witnesses will commit, but their persecution plainly shows that these persecutors are fighting against The Theocratic Government. The Lord so counts it, and designates the persecutors as ones who fight against him. Wickedness in the earth will continue until the battle of that great day of God Almighty, when the religious, totalitarian crowd will be completely wiped out in vindication of Jehovah’s name. Opposers of The Theocracy hate the name of Almighty God. This is particularly true with reference to the totalitarian rule. They take a delight in defaming God’s name and the name of Christ. They likewise take a delight in persecuting the followers of Christ Jesus, for the simple reason that such servants of the Lord proclaim his name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to gather the nations.—Zeph. 3:8, Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s judgment is that the nations shall be gathered to Armageddon. That judgment executed means not one nation will be omitted. He then adds the purpose of his gathering them, saying: “That I may assemble the kingdoms.” These nations and kingdoms mean those to whom Jehovah has said: <sup>£f</sup>Wait ye upon me.” That means that not one of such nations or kingdoms shall escape and that the “nation” of “Christendom”, with all the elements that go to make it up, will be handled just like the others, only “Christendom”, having practiced more fraud and deception, will bear a greater degree of punishment, if possible.

<p><span class="font5">Armageddon is a certainty. All persons now in a covenant with Jehovah and fully devoted to The Theocratic Government are necessarily looking for evidence that Armageddon is near at hand. Such being children of light and walking circumspectly in the light, they are discerning the “signs of the times” and will thereby learn as to the time of Armageddon. The Lord did not reveal to Paul the day or hour, but he did direct Paul as to the signs that would be present indicating the time of the expression of his wrath against all workers of iniquity. Therefore the words of Paul concerning the beginning of Armageddon are these: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them.” The time approaching is in that day when the enemy will be completely destroyed.

<p><span class="font5">Now religionists realize that Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are a people entirely out of the ordinary and separate and distinct from the religious politicians. They see that such are a “peculiar people”. These faithful witnesses put Jehovah and his kingdom above everything. Their testimony concerning Jehovah and his Theocratic Government fills religionists and allies with malicious hatred of the Almighty and his kingdom. Thus the enemy openly oppose everything that pertains to The Theocracy. The Lord causes them to thereby fix their own destiny. They openly espouse the Devil’s cause and work in harmony with the demons opposing the Most High and all who represent Him. He makes his people a praise to his name in the earth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/40</span></p>

Not so, however, with Barak and Deborah, who were even as prophecy has said: “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.” Barak did not go down to Egypt for war equipment and other help. Likewise the servants of The Theocracy today do not go to the religious world for help, because such would be contrary to God’s will. (Isa. 31:1) God’s people today on earth well know they can receive no help from the religious, political combine, and they seek none. Barak and Deborah trusted wholly in the Lord.

God tells all that they must hear and obey, otherwise they cannot receive his protection and blessing. Repeatedly these commandments of the Lord have been called to “Christendom’s” attention, and particularly that of her religious leaders, but the message of warning is refused. Religionists disdain God’s servants and denounce them as meddlers in religious affairs. “Christendom” imagines herself to be a law unto herself, with no one having any right to criticize her or call attention to her rebellious course of action. Jehovah’s witnesses carry God’s message to “Christendom”, and not their own message.

He is separating “the goats” from “his sheep”. “The goats” symbolically describes all those persons who are against The Theocratic Government. That means everyone that is not for The Theocracy, because all such are against it: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scat-tereth abroad.” (Matt. 12:30) The Lord’s “other sheep” are those who flee to the “city of refuge”, the Lord’s organization, and remain there and joyfully serve God and The Theocratic Government. While the separating judgment is being conducted by Christ Jesus he sends forth his anointed servants and their companions to sound warning of the approaching battle of Armageddon and the disastrous results upon those not heeding that warning.

The crucial test applied to “Christendom” will show that the great mass thereof are entirely without faith in God and are opposed to the great Theocratic Government, of which Christ Jesus is the King. That great mass of persons rated as Christians actually deny God and Christ, and in fear of man they bow down to and yield to the totalitarian “form of godliness” and do the will of Satan and the other demons. By the act of Jehovah, “his strange act,” the so-called “organized Christian religion” will be totally destroyed, never again to be restored. These are perilous times, as facts fully support.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah foreknew the trouble that would beset those who serve him, and he made provision for their instruction that they might go in the right way and escape the enemy and find the place of complete refuge. He foreknew how the demons would attack his consecrated people and how they are now attacking all those who serve Him and His kingdom. Today he is revealing to all such faithful ones his means of protection, refuge and salvation. He foreknew and foretold the time of trouble in which all the nations now find themselves. To those who seek him he gives full assurance that if they put their trust fully in him and walk obediently with him they shall have protection and shall not be disappointed. “Thus let them who know thy name put confidence in thee, that thou hast not forsaken the searchers for thee, 0 Jehovah.”—Ps. 9:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At this point Barak pictured the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses who are members of God’s organization on earth. Such are diligent to receive instructions from the Lord given to them through his organization and to faithfully caiyy out the same. Deborah’s presence with the army of Israel would be evidence of Jehovah’s being present and directing his people, his representative Deborah picturing his organization. It would stimulate the army of Israel to more trustful obedience to Barak’s commandments. The army would understand that Jehovah was leading them. So today the Lord’s people recognize that God, through Christ Jesus, is carrying forward his purposes, but that he has his own means or channel for transmitting orders and direction to his people on earth.

Having a heart appreciation of the salvation which vindicates Jehovah’s name and proves his word true, the remnant and their companions continue to rejoice and go forward sounding with the mouth and by use of recorded speech the praises of Jehovah and his government by Christ Jesus. This time of rejoicing was pictured by the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt. With the sea before and the great army of Egypt behind them, the situation looked desperate for Moses and Israelites. But they trusted in Jehovah. Now by faith God’s people see the day of deliverance near, and at the climax of Armageddon they will greatly rejoice and, like Moses, will sing: “The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1 live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation.—Zeph. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That judgment will be executed at Armageddon. Destruction shall come upon them by superhuman power. The visible result upon them will be like that which came upon Sodom and Gomorrah. (Jude 7) As Lot fled from ancient Sodom and was saved from the destruction that came upon those cities, so the persons of good-will who shall now flee to the place of safety may be saved. Many of these are now under the dominating control of the political and commercial elements; but by taking their stand firmly on the Lord’s side they may escape to the place of safety. Modern Moabites and Ammonites shall be -destroyed. Totalitarian rule and rulers, commercial robbers and those who have defied God, shall perish for ever. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/iC)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his belly.—Judg. 3:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ehud struck with such force that the sword went clear in and stayed in. He did not make a halfway job of it. He did his work with a zeal for Jehovah, that zeal which is peculiar only to God’s royal house. Christ Jesus, the Greater Ehud, will do a full and complete job on the combine that stands “where it ought not” to stand. Religionists have made their belly their god. The same is true of the commercial, political allies that have embraced religion for selfish purposes. The religious organization and allies will be entirely incapacitated, unable to draw out the sword which the Greater Ehud thrust into their vitals. The Theocratic message, pushed into “Christendom’s” vitals, is there to stay, foretelling her violent destruction at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed their flocks.—Zeph. 2:7, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This feeding applies specifically after Armageddon. It is the faithful Judeans, “the remnant of the house of Judah,” that do the feeding. This is proof that, at least part of the faithful, spirit-begotten “remnant” ones will survive Armageddon and for a time thereafter will continue to dispense food from the Lord’s table to those of the “great multitude”, and in this they will, no doubt, act in connection with the faithful “princes” on the earth. That will be a joyful and happy organization on earth. Some of God’s royal family, together with the princes of the earth, will be participating in the work of rendering aid to the “great multitude”, all to the praise of the Great Theocrat and his government of righteousness, resting upon the shoulders of Christ the King.

<p><span class="font5">God has fixed a time certain and definite when his purpose shall be fulfilled. Instead of telling men in advance just what is the date or hour, he brings to pass the physical facts showing that the time previously fixed has arrived, and those who have no faith in God’s Word and who continue to practice religion and to follow their own selfish course are in the dark, and for that reason they cannot see the signs of the fixed times and cannot and do not understand. There is need that the texts of the Scriptures and the physical facts, or the signs, that God has brought to pass be set alongside one another and published and brought to the attention of the people of God that they might understand and appreciate the times in which we are living. Thus those who love God are enabled to understand his purpose. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Pride and haughtiness and self-importance must cease among those devoted to The Theocracy. God’s faithful servants, receiving instruction from the Lord, learned that the vindication of his name is of allimportance. That took away from them any cause for acting or even thinking haughtily. In the year 1926 God revealed to his people the folly of “character development”. The faithful spiritual Israelites then saw that each one is required to be faithfully devoted to The Theocracy. The temple judgment, which began in 1918 by the Lord Jesus Christ, cleared out the “evil servant”, and then the faithful went straight on with their assigned duties. All spiritual Israelites must come to unity of the faith and must serve Jehovah harmoniously. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/I/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Men will see the hypocritical religious element exposed in their own dirty methods. A sorry mess! Religion has never been alive to Jehovah God. From his viewpoint religion has ever been a dead body. But politicians and commercial men have been deceived and have not seen the facts. Their eyes are not opened until God’s “strange work” on earth is done. Then those political selfish allies and dupes see that religion is a fallen thing. Now they cry out: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“~We</span><span class="font5"> must have more religion”; because they have not yet realized that religion is diametrically opposed to “Christianity”, hence to everything that is right.

<p><span class="font5">Armageddon shall be waged successfully by God’s great Executioner, Christ Jesus. By that battle Jehovah will clear off and take away all abominable and defiling things on earth and will make Satan’s domain a vast desolation. In the prophetic picture the cleansing or destructive work was extended to the nations bordering on Jerusalem. In the fulfillment of the prophecy the destructive and cleansing work will extend and relate to all the earth, and especially to “Christendom”, because it has been in her that the greatest amount of hypocrisy has been practiced and the greatest reproach has been cast upon Jehovah’s name. The truth concerning Armageddon has been repeatedly drilled into the minds of God’s people since Christ’s coming to the temple. Thus they have been instructed what to expect. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/10</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is that great Spirit, the King of The Theocracy. He is the “express image” of Jehovah God, his Father, and always does the will of his Father Jehovah. The faithful apostles and others who have followed their lead and devoted themselves entirely to Jehovah and Christ Jesus form the body of Christ, and collectively such are designated the “bride” of Christ, “the Lamb’s wife.” All these in harmony with the will of God make known to the people now that The Theocracy is the only hope of humankind, the only refuge and only place of safety, and therefore all such say to the people of good-will: “Come.” Everyone of God’s organization must be busy, and not idle, slothful or indifferent.

<p><span class="font5">The leapers, foreshadowed by the Philistine Dagon worshipers (1 Sam. 5: 4, 5), picture those who worship demons or practice demonism and who help to destroy the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and all other religions. They then defy Jehovah God as the Supreme One and openly express their rebellion against Jehovah. Those demon-worshipers must be punished before the end of Armageddon, and God declares his purpose to punish them. Many of such have at some time tied themselves up with religion for political, business or professional gain or for social purposes. They then openly appear and fill the Devil’s house with deceit and violence. There are only two masters that anyone can serve: Jehovah God and the Devil. These leapers serve the Devil, and they fill the Devil’s house with deceit and violence. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is Head over his church, and the chief member of Jehovah’s capital organization, Zion, pictured by God’s woman. The church of Christ Jesus is called “the Lamb’s wife”; hence the temple company is part of that organization. In 1918 Christ Jesus came to the temple, and then he brought the approved ones to himself into the temple and they were made a part of God’s capital organization, hence are represented in Christ. Deborah “judged Israel”. Thus God used her to picture how he would judge his people on earth and do it through his organization Zion, which judgment is conducted by the Head of Zion, Christ Jesus. In Israel Deborah pronounced judgment according to what God inspired her to say. Likewise the members of Christ’s body, his organization, pronounce the judgment recorded in the Lord’s Word.

<p><span class="font5">Forced to take notice of Jehovah’s witnesses, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy at last recognizes that there is a people on earth who refuse to yield to their inducements and who never quail before their inquisitors. Now Jehovah turns the tables and makes those of “Catholic Action” and their allies turn black in the face. The enemy see that they are exposed, and they see that the people of good-will toward Jehovah are fleeing from the demon organization and finding rest and safety under God’s organization. Jehovah foretold this day of triumph of those who serve and worship him in spirit and in truth: “But ye shall be named the priests of the Lord; men shall call you the ministers of our God; ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. For your shame ye shall have double.”—Isa. 61: 6, 7. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The faithful hear what God says to them, but those who follow worldly teachers of worldly wisdom turn to folly. “They,” who “shall say, Peace and safety”, means “the ambassadors of peace” who are due to “weep bitterly”. (Isa. 33:7) Sueh are the leaders among the people and who mold public opinion according to their own desires. They are makers of propaganda for all others who are willing to hear them and who follow earthly leaders. “They” are persons who have a selfish desire to rule this world for their own satisfaction and who have no use for The Theocracy, and who are against the great Theocrat and his King. They are leaders of the “goat” class and claim to be in position to give reliable assurance as to what is the meaning of present-day conditions. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Although opportunity for world-wide witness work is closing, that will furnish no excuse for any of the consecrated to sleep or be indifferent. All servants of God must now be alert as to their privileges of service and perform that service as they have opportunity. They must be alert to the fact that the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name is directing and carrying forward God’s purpose, and that vindication of his name is the all-important thing. Each one of the faithful will greatly desire to have some part in that great event. They must be awake and alert as to the movement of the enemy and be able to quickly discern the sure “sign” that the battle is about to begin. The “signs of the times” have been and are clear. Next we shall see the sign that Armageddon is about to begin and deliverance is very near. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.—Isa. 55:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today God’s mercy is extended to the anointed remnant, who because of natural weaknesses commit unintentional wrongs, but it is not extended to those who resort to lies against God’s organization and who do wrong against his organization but do not repent and turn entirely away from wrongdoing and then seek the face of the Lord for forgiveness. David said: “I have trusted in thy mercy”; and so likewise those who follow in the footsteps of the Greater David, Christ Jesus, trust in the mercy of Jehovah and receive the “sure mercies of David”. They receive God’s mercy because they continue in a perfect heart devotion to Jehovah and in the faithful, actual service of the great Theocrat and his King. They are faithful in declaring God’s name as they are commissioned to do. They are faithful to protect God’s organization. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The words “the day of the Lord is at hand” anti-typically refer to the destruction of antitypical Jerusalem, that is, the religious systems of the world and particularly “Christendom”. Therefore the command to all, including “Christendom”, is to cease the announcing and boastful prognostication and to give ear to what the Lord God has to say. It is a warning to all the world and particularly “Christendom”. Silence having been commanded, the prophetic words announce: “For the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice.” That means a great slaughter and the flowing of blood, which will take place at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. “For my sword shall be bathed in heaven [where religionists perch themselves in the high rocks] : behold, it shall come down upon Idumea [organized religion], and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. The sword of the Lord is filled with blood.”—Isa. 34: 5, 6. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This is the song all of God’s organization together sing. Those of the “great multitude”, called the “other sheep” of the Lord, become companions of the “remnant” of the capital organization of Jehovah and who are called “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Their protection and refuge is under the Lord’s organization, and there they dwell together in peace with all who are of that organization. What Jesus said long ago is true now: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matt. 11: 28) Those who now seek rest, refuge and salvation will find their heart’s desire only by and through Christ Jesus and by full devotion to Jehovah and his great Theocratic Government under Christ the King. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We are in “the times and the seasons”, and the faithful are earnestly and diligently watching for the “sign”. When Jehovah’s faithful servants under the leadership of Christ Jesus see every avenue closed to actively and openly engage in advertising The Theocracy and religious leaders and totalitarian allies are saying “Peace and safety”, that will be the sign that Armageddon is just about to begin. Such will constitute the “signs of the times and season’ for the battle. Until that sign is apparent in every part of “Christendom” and every avenue is closed to giving testimony openly and boldly, the remnant and “other sheep” of the Lord must continue to sound out the message of the great Theocrat and his government under Christ Jesus. This must be done to the name of Jehovah and that those who are of good-will might find the way of escape. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The practice of thieves is to come in the night, when darkness envelopes everything. God’s law is that if the thief is caught breaking up or into the house in the nighttime he may be killed with impunity, without violating the everlasting covenant. (Ex. 22: 2) Religious leaders and the principal ones of their flock, including the “evil servant”, are enveloped in gross darkness. In the darkness they attempt to steal the people’s devotion, faith, worship and service from the Lord God and cause the people to follow men as leaders. To that end they cry out: “Peace and safety!” That cry is false. Immediately then they are slain by the Lord’s hand. Judgment, long ago entered, will be executed at Armageddon. The thieves thus breaking in the great Executioner, Christ Jesus, will destroy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s “strange work” in which the remnant and their companions participate being completed, then these servants of the Most High are in great danger through the enemy. All ruling factors of the earth become open enemies of those on the side of the great Theocrat. Then Christ Jesus, the Greater Ehud, sounds his war trumpet and the heavenly host go into action and the battle begins and rages, resulting in complete destruction of all of Jehovah’s enemies, both visible and invisible. God’s “strange work” will be carried on in some part of the earth until the time for the beginning of his “strange act”, the battle of that great day, and then God will avenge his elect servants who are standing faithful and true, carrying out the terms of their covenant.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Judg. 4: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The manifest purpose of Jehovah was to draw the enemy into the open and force them to fight. In the fulfillment of the prophetic drama Jehovah is drawing all the enemy into the open and there forcing them to don garments of identification that they are his enemies and openly show themselves as against The Theocracy and thereby admit that all are worthy to be destroyed by the Lord at the battle of Armageddon. God used the waters of Kishon as one of his battle forces to execute the anti-theocratic enemies. At Armageddon he will use his inanimate creation and forces of the earth to execute the anti-theocratic forces. He will clearly demonstrate that it is His battle, and not man’s, and will make the enemy know that Jehovah is destroying them.

<p><span class="font5">From and after' 1918 the ones approved to God have gone forward proclaiming Jehovah’s name and kingdom. Like others who have gone before them, they are Jehovah’s witnesses. They are not a sect, nor an organization founded by men, but have become members of God’s organization on earth. These faithful followers of Christ Jesus, who are promised a place in the Kingdom, he calls his 'Tittle flock” of sheep, and to them he says: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12: 32) The last of these witnesses on earth are designated the “remnant” of God’s organization, symbolized by his “woman”. Therefore against these the Devil and his representatives wage a warfare of persecution, as foretold: “And the dragon [Satan] was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed.”—Rev. 12: 17. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The great Theocrat is Jehovah. The Theocracy is the government of Jehovah God, which shall rule the world in righteousness to the praise and honor of his name and which shall fully vindicate his name. The King of that great Theocracy, or the one ruling directly under the command of the great Theocrat, is Christ Jesus. For his own name’s sake Jehovah sent Jesus to earth. The primary purpose of Jesus’ coming was to vindicate Jehovah’s name. Jesus came in the name of his Father. His Father’s name was put upon him, and all that reproached Jehovah also hated Christ Jesus for his name’s sake. And even to this day all who faithfully represent the Lord Jesus are hated for his name’s sake, which hatred against them is manifested in the worst manner by hypocritical religionists. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Contrary to that commandment of Jehovah, the priests of religion teach the people to violate God’s law and do so by bestowing honor upon men and putting the state above Almighty God and compelling children to “heil” men and salute flags in order to instill into the young the theories and practices of the demons. Concerning the Kingdom gospel, which the Lord commands must now be. preached to all nations as a witness, the priests not only ignore but do everything within their power to hinder obedience to such commandment. They destroy the hope of men concerning God’s provision for salvation. They deliberately fight against God and his law. No wonder God announces his purpose to completely destroy religion and all who persist in using religion to defame his name. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Mark 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That means that Jehovah’s time is at hand for a final reckoning with the enemy. They that read and understand will be only those who are earnest, faithful supporters of The Theocracy, and who therefore understand and appreciate Jehovah and his government. These are “in Judsea”, in the class that praise and serve Jehovah God. “The mountains” refers to God’s kingdom under Jehovah, the King Eternal, and Christ Jesus, his King anointed to rule the earth. Seeing the existing conditions, the faithful ones, the Judeans, must flee for safety to the Theocracy of Jehovah by Christ Jesus. There is no other place of safety, no other means of deliverance.

<p><span class="font5">That sword with which the remnant is armed is the message concerning The Theocratic Government. Oppressed people must learn that the “Higher Powers” are Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and that religion is of Satan. And how did the Ehud class, the “remnant”, fashion the “sword” for their work? They ceased entirely from bestowing honor and praise upon men. They no longer sought the approval of men. They obeyed the commandments of Jehovah God, to wit: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” (2 Tim. 2: 15) Thereafter the remnant no longer have used religious methods. By using God’s appointed way and the sword they put themselves in danger of criticism and opposition by the religious leaders. That neither frightened nor deterred them.

Modern-day Moabites, the commercial traffickers in the wealth of the earth and in human blood, have heaped great reproach upon the name of Jehovah, and those reproaches have fallen upon the ones who love and faithfully serve the Most High and his King. To his faithful servants the assurance is given: “Thy Father, which seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.” (Matt. 6: 4) And to his adversaries he says: “Understand, ye brutish among the people; and, ye fools, when will ye be wise ? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?” (Ps. 94: 8, 9) At Armageddon Jehovah will make good these promises, fully carrying them out.

<p><span class="font5">Deborah was as much associated with the palm tree as was the feast of tabernacles celebrated in the temple of God. The “great multitude” hailed the King by waving palm branches. God’s organization is greater than Deborah and is likened to the palm tree with which Deborah was identified and which pictures righteousness, the righteous standard of judgment. Israelites went up to Deborah for judgment. Since 1918 the faithful servants of God have abandoned religion and gone up to God’s organization to submit themselves to the righteous judgment of his organization, pronounced and executed by Christ Jesus, the Head and Judge thereof. Deborah did not set herself up above God’s written law, but did as commanded by his law. Likewise Jehovah’s organization proceeds strictly in conformity to the divine law and refuses to make any compromise with any earthly organization.

<p><span class="font5">The totalitarians now boast of their power and strength and declare they are invulnerable. They dwell carelessly, and the big dictator says in his heart: T am, and there is none else beside me.’ Then the totalitarian rule comes to an end and the place occupied by such becomes desolate. The present-day boastful, wicked, cruel dictator rulers now laugh and deride the faithful servants of Jehovah God, and ill-treat them in an unspeakable manner of wickedness, and to them will soon apply Jesus’ words: “Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.” (Luke 6: 25) The modern-day Ninevites now sing hilariously, but soon they shall mourn and weep.

Jesus was put to the severest test and proved faithful. His servants, called to follow in his footsteps, must be subjected to a like test; and being thus forewarned, they are forearmed and they put their trust wholly and completely in the Most High. The combined enemy now surrounds the Lord’s servants, all of whom are in danger, and that danger is ever increasing. Some of the Lord’s little ones come to the point of almost despair, and it is for the comfort of those who are weak in faith that these precious promises are recorded in the Scripture. This is the time, therefore, for all the Lord’s servants to fully trust in and have complete confidence in Jehovah and his King. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/40</span></p>

Religion and religious paraphernalia, used in connection with idol worship which has been carried on in defiance of God’s plain command, constitute the chief stumbling-blocks laid in men’s way. God’s creation of the earth is for those who faithfully serve and obey him. All creations that fail or refuse to obey him are wicked, and “all the wicked will he destroy” at Armageddon. Then the great multitude upon the cleansed earth will, in obedience to his command and under the immediate direction of Christ Jesus, “fill the earth” with a righteous race that shall forever praise the name of Jehovah and joyfully serve Him, the Almighty God.

Being in darkness or degraded, they are wholly unable to understand God’s purpose concerning the great Theocratic Government. Although denied the favor of light on God’s purpose, those wicked spirits or demons have been permitted to exist and work with their chief, the Devil, to carry out his original challenge made to Jehovah. God has reserved or deferred the execution of the judgment of death against these wicked ones until Armageddon, the day of his vindication. Until that time he keeps the wicked ones under surveillance and protects his faithful people from them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/40</span></p>

Jehovah has opened the windows of heaven and poured out upon his people the richest blessings. He has revealed to them an understanding of his prophecies written long ago. Jehovah in the heavens has his enemies in derision. He sends forth his faithful servants to sound the final warning that destruction shall shortly come upon them. The enemies rage, defy God, spurn his message, and persecute his messengers. But all their efforts shall fail to bring about the destruction or injury of those who serve the Most High. The faithful know what will be the final result. They know that Jehovah is all-powerful and will carry out his purpose, and that very soon complete deliverance shall come to all who love and serve him.

<p><span class="font5">The “high corners” or “high towers” of the earthly division of Satan’s organization think they can furnish all the necessary things for mankind and can shield them from disaster. They are certain to be disappointed, because Almighty God has so stated. Christ Jesus is the chief corner stone of Jehovah’s capital organization. He is the “head stone” and the “corner”. (Isa. 28: 16; Ps. 118: 22) Christ Jesus is the Vindicator of the name of Jehovah God. At Armageddon he will lead the heavenly host against the earthly “high corners” or “high towers” of Satan’s organization, and also against the invisible host of Satan. All the “high corners” the Lord Jesus will overturn, lay low, and crush to pieces.—Isa. 2:12,15. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God places his truth before the people in contrast to Satan’s wickedness and permits all to intelligently choose. Those who wish to remain in the Devil’s organization are not driven out; as it is written that those who believe and serve God shall live and those who do not believe and serve God abide in death. (John 3: 35,36) Christianity today is proclaiming to the world that the Kingdom is here and that the only means of relief, deliverance and salvation is through the Theocratic Government of Jehovah. Christianity warns the people that within a short time Jehovah, by Christ Jesus, will completely destroy all the governments and systems of this world. Christianity never has to be on the defensive. Christ fights no defensive battles. He will lead in the great battle of Armageddon shortly, which will wipe out the enemy and completely vindicate Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Christendom,” with her demon-control of men, is modem Babylon. Every crooked politician, every greedy commercial giant, and every conscienceless clergyman now finds a habitation in modern Babylon. They being under control of the unclean spirit demons, the Lord describes these crooked ones as 'unclean and hateful birds’. Long ago Jehovah gave his word that Satan and his demon associates would be permitted to remain and continue their unhindered opposition to him, and that for a certain time; and that at the end of such time God’s name must be declared throughout the earth, and this proclamation will be quickly followed by exhibition of his supreme power against the wicked.

But the power of those so-called “mighty” men, their material wealth and influence, will count for nothing at Armageddon. Seeing their structures crumbling to pieces, they shall cry bitterly and will find no help and no means of escape. Everything on which they have set heart and soul will be ruined, because God has declared it so. They will be at last convinced it is the end and the hand of Almighty God is operating against them.

Even so-called “Christian religion” has long been the chief means used by the Devil to entrap men in his snare that leads to destruction. The beginning of the practice of religion was a desire on man’s part to escape death and to become wise like demons. At the battle of the great day of God Almighty religion will furnish no protection or means of escape. In that great fight no nation will find protection because of religion, neither will God spare individual persons of any nation because of their religion, whether they be sincere religious practitioners or bad religionists. Religion has never at any time safeguarded any man against death.

(Isa. 60:17) They must obey Jehovah’s commandments and put forth their best endeavors to ‘turn others to righteousness’. (Dan. 12:3) They must be lovers of righteousness and haters of lawlessness.

They are to have in mind at all times that it is the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s name in which they are interested and which will be accomplished.

This also proves that Catholic Action would be organized and the totalitarian state would grab control of the earth. From that time on God’s people must not fear man or demons.

As this storm raged in advance of Barak he moved his army down the mountain and into action.

Because one claims to be a servant of the Lord does not mean that he shall obtain mercy at the hands of Jehovah. The Scriptures show that God’s mercy is extended to those who faithfully serve him. “Also unto thee, 0 Lord, belongeth mercy; for thou renderest to every man according to his work.” (Ps. 62:12) The mercy of God is not extended to the wicked, that is, to those who continue willfully in wrongdoing.

This slaughter work he does in vindication of Jehovah’s holy name. This will prove to all creation that Jehovah is the Supreme One.

The “fourscore years of rest” which followed Ehud’s victory is symbolical of the rule or government that is first righteous and wholly devoted to Almighty God. That Theocratic Government is the only place where men will ever find rest. The faithful remnant will be blessed by having part in that glorious organization under Christ their Head.

Therefore we are for God and for the Lamb, Christ Jesus.” These refuse to hail, honor and worship men or things and thereby ascribe salvation to men, things, or man-made organizations. All those of the “great multitude” ascribe salvation to God and to his Lamb, Christ Jesus, the King. All of these make known that they are for The Theocracy. They are diligent to do so.

<p><span class="font5">Those who came to Barak at Mount Tabor regarded not their lives dear unto them, but were determined to obey Jehovah’s commandment that he had given them through Barak. Thus was foreshadowed the apostle Paul and others of like spirit as expressed by that faithful apostle: “But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.” (Acts 20: 24) Not all the tribes of Israel mustered out to fight for the overthrow of the oppressors of Jehovah’s people. The fighting men of Naphtali and Zebulun came and were accompanied by volunteers from other tribes, who formed the remnant whom the Lord used. They pictured the remnant of spiritual Israel. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W12/1/10</span></p>

Those who are strong in faith will be blind to everything except Jehovah’s Word and will permit nothing to turn them away from the great Theocracy. Their determination is and will be: Come what may, we will serve Jehovah God and his King. There cannot be the slightest doubt about the result of “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. Christ Jesus, the Field Marshal of Jehovah, is certain to gain the victory. Regardless of how terrible conditions in the earth may become, know this: that victory is with the great Theocrat and his King.

<p><span class="font5">God’s remnant and the “other sheep” will be the only ones who will continue boldly to advocate the Theocratic Government. They are doing so now under adverse conditions. It is the purpose of religious leaders and totalitarian rulers to silence all those who proclaim the message of The Theocracy, and they are proceeding to do so upon the theory that the message of the Lord proclaimed by such witnesses is subversive. The message shocks their religious susceptibilities, and it is an easy matter for them to persecute those who proclaim The Theocratic Government. It is a conflict between Satan and the Lord Jehovah and his King, with Satan’s visible agents doing whatsoever they can to silence Jehovah’s witnesses, and they are looking forward to the time when they can and will silence God’s witnesses. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/Jfi</span></p>

All persons who have a desire for life should fully awaken to the situation and ascertain the cause of present-day perils and what is the only means of escape to safety. Honest and unbiased consideration of the Scriptures and the admitted facts will prove to the satisfaction of sincere persons, and that beyond all doubt, that the influence and power of the demons over the people is the primary cause of these times of peril and that Satan, the chief among demons, together with his host of wicked ones, is hastening the whole world like a swiftflowing river down to eternal death, as pictured by the river Jordan flowing into the Dead sea. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The warning is being sounded, and Jehovah's witnesses must continue to sound the same until God says, Cease sounding. Then every human that has not gotten out of Satan's organization after hearing the warning and before the battle of the great day of God Almighty begins will be cut off at Armageddon from life. Satan’s visible organization will be utterly depopulated. Jehovah now makes clear his purpose, and, having purposed it, he will do it. Therefore to thus carry out his purpose to execute his judgment already written and declared, he says: “I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place.” (1:4) Such stretching out of his hand will be after the manner of God’s doing at the Red sea.—Ex. 15:12.

God has predestinated that a fixed and limited number taken from among human creatures, who maintain their integrity toward God, shall be forever with the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven as spirit creatures; and he has provided for another company of individuals, but with no fixed number, who receive God’s approval for their faithfulness under the test applied, and which faithful persons shall live forever on earth. What shall be the end or destiny of individuals, God does not predetermine. God sets before men his fixed rules, and those who obey him enter into everlasting life, and those who disobey him die and remain dead. God is no respecter of individuals.

(Eccl. 1:4) It does mean, however, the visible (that is, earthly) organizations of “Christendom” particularly and the nations round about her. That devouring or destruction shall be an expression of Jehovah’s consuming zeal in righteousness and holiness, and he will perform this in vindication of his holy name. His zeal burns against and consumes the wicked organizations of men that have defied him or that have ignored him and that have followed the religious leaders of demonism.

As to “Christendom”, that is, the practitioners of religion of the religious denominations, they are still in the dark and see nothing concerning the Lord’s coming to the temple. To all such the day of the Lord has come as a thief in the night. All such are in darkness and do not see the signs of the times. The day of the Lord arrived in 1918 as a thief, and darkness prevailed. It was not so, however, as to the faithful. The “glory of the Lord” was seen of them because his approval had been given to them. They appreciated that he was at the temple, and went forward to serve Jehovah and his kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is not the cry of the fish-sellers to sell for gain, but a cry of dismay because of the spoiling of the traffic in which they were engaged. Satan’s agents have by means of religion fished for and made big hauls of men who, as poor fish, have because of fear gone right into the net provided for them by the Devil. At Armageddon all fishing of that kind must cease. Such fishermen deal treacherously and by their religious bait attract and lead many peoples into captivity. After Armageddon religious leaders will no more be permitted to take men like fish into their nets. Their commercial religion being done, they shall utter a cry of despair and dismay.

<p><span class="font5">All those of the light and who continue in the light will not be in doubt as to what is Jehovah’s purpose. Hence the apostle says: “Ye . . . are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief.” At the beginning of the “day of the Lord”, in 1918, that day did come upon them as a thief. It was not until 1922 that these faithful ones knew the Lord had come to his temple, but there is no need now for them to be in darkness in that part of the day when “the sign” is made manifest. When that sign does clearly appear to the faithful, and sudden destruction comes upon the enemy, no one who tells the truth will be in doubt. At the climax of the day of the Lord the faithful are not deceived by the religionists’ cry of “Peace and safety”, nor are they in darkness, and that time of “the day” does not come upon them as a thief.

His people do know, however, that all the surrounding conditions point to the near approach of Armageddon, when the great issue of supremacy and vindication of Jehovah’s name will be settled for all time. They confidently look to Jehovah for his mercy and protection, and they know that salvation belongs alone to Jehovah and that those who trust in his mercy and continue faithfully to obey God shall receive protection, deliverance and salvation. For some time many of God’s people have said, and say: “Oh that the salvation of Israel [spiritual Israel] were come out of Zion!” (Ps. 14:7) Let all such who have hope and who look for salvation now rejoice because the day of deliverance is at hand.

He was playing his part in the drama under Jehovah’s direction to thus foreshadow that God’s remnant now on earth will not and cannot engage in his “strange work” and battle against demonism unless Jehovah’s organization, under its head, Christ Jesus, goes along with them, and leads and directs them. The organization must work in full and complete harmony. That is the reason now that we observe Jehovah’s witnesses working exactly in harmony as a part of the Lord’s organization and under the direct supervision of Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W12/1/40</span></p>

Only those who seek righteousness and meekness, trusting fully in Jehovah and his King, have any promise of being hid at Armageddon. To those faithful ones, pictured by Ebed-melech, Jehovah says: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I </span><span class="font5">will surely deliver thee [from the Executioner], and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 39:18) These words of the Most High apply at the present time.

The “fifth column” is employed, by planting throughout the country radical and violent opposers of Jehovah’s witnesses who act at the instance of the Hierarchy and attempt to make it appear that Jehovah’s witnesses are opponents of the government.

Amid the greatest turmoil that has ever afflicted the earth up to this time God’s people serenely march forward, never breaking their ranks. Those now devoted to The Theocracy can and do say: “Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people.” The only joy on earth for people of any nation can be found in the Lord.

Upon that organization God pours his righteous indignation, and all the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon her. Only those of good-will toward Jehovah God can possibly be saved. Jehovah’s indignation being poured out upon all the nations of earth, the entire earthly visible rule shall cease; and this is true because the demons now exercise power, influence and control over the nations. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/40</span></p>

So likewise the Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater Ehud, is carrying out the purpose of Jehovah and has his host ready to act upon the giving of a command to advance. Ehud’s trumpet sounding high in the mountains would be heard and immediately repeated by many other trumpets. Within a short time the country would be aroused and the march would begin. They “went down” from the mountain to follow Ehud their leader.

God produces a famine in their land by denying the religious meddlers a vision of his purpose. They are like the demons; they go into darkness and remain there. The religious susceptibilities of these oppressors being shocked, they begin to howl. During the “strange work” some oppressors and their supporters appear to repent.

They teach that the political rulers are the “higher powers” and “ministers of God”. Thereby many persons are turned away from Almighty God and taught to serve creatures.

Neither Gog, nor Hitler, nor any other leaders of the opponents of The Theocracy will escape the wrath of Almighty God. Jehovah’s Executive Officer will strike down all opponents. God’s wrath will be upon the prince of darkness and all the demons, and upon all human creation that holds to or remains under demon influence and power. All such are in darkness as to Jehovah’s purpose, and all are openly opposed to The Theocratic Government; all of such are enemies of Jehovah God, and all shall perish. That battle will mark the final end of wickedness. Not one of the wicked will find the way of escape. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/10</span></p>

The “hand of a woman” did not mean into Deborah’s hand personally; she is the representative of Jehovah God, picturing his organization, and the meaning was that God’s organization would be successful. Jehovah does not deliver religious racketeers and allies into the hand of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth to be destroyed by them, but he will deliver the enemies of The Theocracy into the hand of his organization, and Christ Jesus the Head of that great organization will execute them. The honor of the slaughter will not be given to Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth, but entirely to Christ Jesus himself. All saints will participate in the honor reflected to them by being under him. 17</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God.” (Ps. 10:4) Jehovah sends his faithful servants to the proud religionists, and these witnesses call attention to the presence of the King, Christ Jesus, and that the day of his government is here. They point out to them that the only hope of humankind is in The Theocracy; but such wicked ones completely ignore Jehovah’s admonition. Such obstinate class, although receiving the witness, refuse to heed the Lord’s commandment as set forth in Revelation 22:17. They do not seek righteousness and meekness; and the Lord’s judgment written concerning such is therefore that they shall be “cut off”. Those who seek Jehovah and his Theocratic Government before Armageddon and remain faithful thereto are the only ones who find protection and safety.

In this hour of great distress, when the demons by use of religion are debauching the human race and the woes upon the world are increasing, God’s faithful servants must continue to seek meekness and to receive instruction from him. Those who now know of The Theocracy and who obey the great Theocrat must hold fast to what they have and continue to increase their knowledge and to confidently rely upon their great Teacher. Wickedness shall not continue for long now. Jehovah’s judgments by Christ Jesus proceed.

Those approved at the temple judgment received from the Lord this command, which they must obey: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness.” The coming of Christ the King and the beginning of his kingdom is good news, or gospel, to all who love righteousness and hate iniquity. Those approved must therefore be witnesses to the Lord and his kingdom. (Isa. 43:10) These witnesses must bear testimony to the name of Jehovah, to his government, and to his King; otherwise they would be unfaithful.

<p><span class="font5">Long ago he entered his judgment that the nations must be gathered, into united opposition to The Theocratic Government and to the message thereof. Among the many nations assembled there are some people of good-will toward God. The nations or kingdoms as a whole, Jehovah shows, are not worthy of saving; only those individuals under such nations who show goodwill toward him and flee to his organization can hope to be saved. “Christendom” claims to be serving Jehovah God; but she is not. At Armageddon the Lord will prove what she really is, and all survivors will forever look upon her with contempt. All will then see and fully appreciate that religion is a fraud and snare and a racket and the defamation of God’s holy name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">From about A D. 1878 Jehovah began taking out of the nations a “people for his name”. These he put to the test at the temple judgment in 1918, and sent the approved ones forth to do his work. Now is the time when Jehovah puts his favor upon those who truly love and serve him; and this proves the fulfillment of the above prophecy concerning their commission. In 1914 The King, Christ Jesus, was enthroned and the Kingdom set up. The commissioned remnant went forth at his command to proclaim the name of Jehovah and his government. Why was this done ? Acts 15:14-18 answers: “That the residue of men [a people for his name] might seek after the Lord,” and those of good-will of all nations might flee to The Theocratic Government. All this Jehovah foretold, and his purpose must be accomplished. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The religious systems can furnish neither protection nor salvation to anyone from the terrors now upon the world and from the disaster that is about to come upon the world at Armageddon. God set up in Israel the “cities of refuge”, to which the unintentional manslayer might flee for protection from the executioner’s hand. (Numbers 35) Such cities of refuge picture the salvation under God’s organization from destruction that shall fall upon the world at Armageddon. It is in that organization that those who will form the “great multitude” now find shelter and protection, and which shall be to their salvation from disaster at Armageddon. The ark which Noah built at Jehovah’s command also pictured God’s organization which furnishes protection and salvation to those who place themselves under it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To be of good-will is to have a sincere desire to know and to serve Jehovah and his King of The Theocracy. One who is of good-will begins to seek the Lord. That way is now open to all peoples, kindreds, and tongues of every nation who desire to serve the Most High. God is no respecter of persons. Those who conform to his rules receive his favor. God specifically warns all such of the approaching day of his wrath to be expressed in the battle of that great day of God Almighty and tells them what they must do. (Zeph. 2:1-3) Only those who call upon Jehovah’s name and declare themselves for him and his Theocracy and its King can find salvation. It is in Jehovah’s organization under Christ, the Head thereof, and who is the Minister of Jehovah and his Vindicator, that salvation can be found.—Joel 2: 32.

Let every lover of righteousness now give heed to the warning which the Lord sounds. There is great danger lurking in the way of the consecrated, and some of these are liable to be turned away from the path of righteousness and lose everything. In times past many have claimed to be Christ’s followers and have regularly prayed the prayer which Jesus taught his followers, to wit: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven,’ but have not prayed such prayer in sincerity.

<p><span class="font5">Since the year 1918, and more particularly since 1933 forward, persecution of those devoted to God and his kingdom has constantly increased and evil men, particularly the religionists, have become more vicious. Themselves deceived by the demons, they have deceived and continue to deceive multitudes of others. Today Communism, Nazism, and Fascism, and the religious leaders associated with them, increase in their wicked deeds toward the people. The masses are under these wieked leaders, all of whom persecute the supporters of The Theocratic Government. It is necessary for the covenant people of God to have the Scriptures and the attending facts in mind in order that they may escape the snares of the demons.

They must be diligent to do what is right and diligent to seek meekness by studying and learning from God’s Word what is his will concerning them. They must serve God and Christ and therefore devote themselves wholly and entirely to the support of The Theocratic Government. They must refuse to indulge in religion and must stand firmly on the side of God and his King, Christ Jesus. They associate themselves with God’s anointed in the service, announcing The Theocratic Government. These constitute the “other sheep”, which the Lord is now gathering.

(Ps. 36:9) His organization is revealed under the name of “Zion”, his “woman”, or the one who nurtures the children of life. Jehovah grants life by and through Zion, over which Christ Jesus is the Head and Jehovah’s Chief Executive Officer. The teachers of persons who seek true knowledge are Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The present is the time or day when these great Teachers are giving instruction to those seeking the true and right way. “And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.” (30:20) Jehovah gives instruction by his Word, written by his direction and inspiration. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/40</span></p>

Hence these are the ones named as “princes”, chief ruling ones, among the religionists on earth. The slaughter of the religionists comes first. The words “in the day” mean at and during the actual battle of Armageddon, which takes place after or at the conclusion of God’s “strange work”, during which “this gospel of the kingdom” has been preached to all the world for a witness. The time has arrived for execution of the judgment of Jehovah upon Satan and his supporters. The punishment will fall upon the leaders, or ruling ones, of “Christendom”, the Hierarchy.

Likewise God’s faithful servants, in doing their work since 1922, have continued to pray, and Jehovah has heard their prayers. Another example of not slacking the hands was that of the Gibeonites, who were desperately in need of help and who called upon Joshua, sending him the message: “Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us.” (Josh. 10:6) There the Gibeonites pictured the people of good-will, the “other sheep” of the Lord now being gathered, who now need help; and so the remnant the Lord commands to push on with the witness work and slack not the hand. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/40</span></p>

For this hour of execution Jehovah bids the enemy to wait for him, for then, says he, 'I will rise up to the prey’; that is, to make an attack and take the spoil. Why will Jehovah bring on such destructive results? “To make himself an everlasting name.” At the Red sea he divided the waters and caused his people to cross over on dry land and then engulfed the Egyptian army in the waters and destroyed them.

The present is a day of judgment of the nations by that Mighty One, Christ Jesus, whom God has appointed to sit in judgment. It is also the time of judgment of individuals.

The time draws near when all such work of the totalitarians shall fully collapse, and then never again shall the cruel politicians enjoy their stately buildings erected to the memory of those who are demoncontrolled and who are debauching the nations.

That did come as a thief, and this shows that the day of the Lord mentioned by the apostle in verse one has reference to the day of the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple for judgment. The day, as a whole, or entire fixed period of time, comes as a thief. Consistently, various features of that day and the things that take place in that day, including the destruction at Armageddon as an expression of Jehovah’s wrath, would likewise come upon all the peoples of the earth who are not enlightened.

To such he reveals his light and makes known to them in this time of darkness his purpose and what is his immediate purpose concerning the wicked. With the coming of the day of the Lord great darkness came upon religionists and political leaders.

Regardless of what men may do, the Lord will perform his purpose. Probably the exposing of that “dirt”, or filthy record and action, of the religionists will furnish the excuse for the radical element to inflict punishment upon the Hierarchy, as stated at Revelation 17:16, 17.

He did not seek honor at the hands of men. He never at any time attempted to exalt himself. In the eyes of the ruling element of the world he “had a bad character”, although he was the only true and perfect character that ever walked this earth. Faithfulness in performance of his assigned duty merited and brought him God’s approval.

Without any doubt the Lord is now maneuvering the enemy and confounding them. This confusion of the enemy will greatly increase.

The Greater Barak is with God’s people today and leading them, and therefore they must know that the battle is God’s and not man’s, and that God will through Christ Jesus do the fighting, for the vindication of His name, which battle incidentally will result in the deliverance of all those who faithfully devote themselves to Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">Following the AV orld War and the releasing of God’s people from restraint, in 1919, the work of gathering from the far-away countries began. The dispersed or scattered ones are all a virgin class. They have not been tied up with religion, but have been kept under the influence of the world organization. Desiring the righteous government they flee from Satan’s organization and come to Mount Zion, the kingdom under Christ, and bring their offering, to wit, 'the calves of their lips.’ They bring all the strength they possess to the service and praise of The Theocratic Government. Some in antitypieal Ethiopia showed goodwill toward God, and they came with the remnant of spiritual Israel, and shall form the “great multitude”. As to the rest of the Ethiopians or Cushites, those against The Theocracy, God says: “Ye shall be slain by my sword.”—2:12. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Theocracy is the hope of man. There is no other hope. For this hope and the publication of The Theocracy Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions stand accused before all nations. They welcome such opposition and the reproach that is heaped upon them. They rejoice to have some part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, well knowing that The Theocratic Government soon shall triumph and that those who stand firmly on the side of the great Theoerat and his King will share in that victory and continue forever in the joy of the Lord. World-wide opposition to The Theocratic Government does not cause discouragement of those who faithfully proclaim the name of the Most High. That their courage may be strong and their hopes continue bright, the Lord feeds his people upon the spiritual food that is convenient for them.

<p><span class="font5">In the Devil’s organization “the hills” represent the highest or lifted-up part of that organization on earth. Those of Satan’s organization who occupy the highest place in the earth will at the time of the battle of Armageddon be in such dismay that they will cry out for the organization to protect them: “to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.” (Hos 10:8) The haughty ones who have relied on religion for insurance and on their wealth and position for protection shall be brought low. The mountain of Jehovah’s house, The Theocracy, in that day shall be exalted above the mountains and hills of Satan’s organization. In the house or organization of Jehovah is the only place of safety and deliverance. There is none other. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Religionists, demonized, fanatically sing patriotic songs and wave the flag, while engaged in violating every rule or principle for which it stands. Why? Because the demons have besieged and possessed the religious practitioners. Why does the Lord permit it? (1) To afford opportunity for all who so desire to put themselves on the Devil’s side and become opposers of The Theocracy; and (2), for a stronger reason, to afford opportunity for God’s servants to prove their integrity toward him. Christ Jesus was put to the severest test. Now his faithful followers on earth must have a like test. They delight to fill up some of the sufferings of Christ “left behind”. Deliverance of his faithful servants is certain and will be soon; and the prophecy which God caused Moses to utter long ago is certain now to be fulfilled.

Therefore let no one of the remnant or of the Jonadabs now tremble or fail to perform his full duty, nor slack his hands. Let the witness work be pressed on with ever-increasing vigor. Rejoice and sing for joy, all who are privileged to now be on the side of The Theocratic Government. Victory is certain, and it is nigh. All the Scriptures and all the physical facts fully prove that the great battle will begin shortly. “Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” (Josh. 1:9) Salvation belongeth to Jehovah, and he will deliver those who trust in him.

<p><span class="font5">The Pharisees and associates were able to say “Peace” only after they had suppressed the Lord Jesus. It is reasonable to conclude that in this present time the mighty religious leaders and allies will take a course similar to that taken by the Pharisees. In these days the “other sheep”, or “great multitude”, are constantly inci easing and their shouts are joined together with those of the remnant in proclaiming the presence of Christ the King and his kingdom. Religious leaders, moved to anger against them, increase their endeavors in every possible way to suppress the messengers of The Theocracy. All this must be done before they can cry “Peace and safety”. All the present evidence shows that exactly these conditions exist. Hence we are approaching near Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When they quit fighting among themselves all the totalitarian rulers will turn their attention to the complete suppression of everything pertaining to The Theocratic Government. That The Theocratic Government is suppressed now in many nations means that the hour is rapidly approaching when the “sign” of Armageddon will be clearly revealed and all on the side of Jehovah will see and appreciate it. That “sign” will be the announcement “Peace and safety”; which sign cannot fully appear as long as this world-wide witness work of The Theocracy is carried on in the earth. Shall any of God’s people now sigh and cry because they see that the witness work is coming to a close? Not at all. On the contrary, the faithful will rejoice. They know it is God’s work. Their trust is entirely in Jehovah and in his King. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation is far from, the wicked.—Ps. 119:155.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Will Jehovah God grant salvation to his enemies? God’s Word says No. To say that the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus is provided for all humankind, including those who hate God and his government under Christ, is wholly unreasonable and certainly unscriptural. God permitted his beloved Son to purchase the human race in order that those who believe and serve him might not perish. (John 3:16) It necessarily follows that those who do not believe on Christ Jesus shall perish. Believing means obeying also. Salvation is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, and certainly a gift is not forced upon those unwilling to accept that gift. In fact, a gift is impossible to be conferred upon anyone who refuses that which is offered as a gift. All the wicked do refuse and have refused and continue to refuse, and do oppose God and his kingdom. W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.—2 Tim. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many centuries ago faithful men such as David set their heart upon The Theocratic Government. Because of their faith in that government and its King, and their love for Jehovah and the Messiah, those men endured all manner of persecution and affliction and died in faith, waiting for the coming of the King. The King is now here. The Theocracy has begun to function. With confidence we look for the early return of those faithful men of old, and then they will enter into the service and joy of the Lord in fullness. Those now on earth who are wholly devoted to God and his King need to wait only a very short time, but in that time they must endure hardness as good soldiers of the King. Keep in mind the admonition of Christ Jesus: ‘He that endures to the end shall be saved. We know that the day of deliverance is near.

<p><span class="font5">The low place is occupied by a commercial, materialistic class. They associate themselves with the religion of “Christendom” for purely commercial purposes or gain. The Lord says all such shall howl. The reason is that all merchant people are cut down, those who have used so-called “Christian religion” for material gam are destroyed. The wealth, represented by silver, cannot deliver any or obtain for any a ransom in the day of God’s wrath. The Roman Catholic organization, ruled by the Hierarchy, have formed the most commercial organization on earth. The material riches thereof are fabulous. They have piled up silver and gold and other material wealth or treasure while falsely claiming to serve God, and have obtained that treasure by false pretenses; hence they are cut off.

(Josh. 4:5) It is only those persons of good-will, the “remnant” and the Jonadabs, that employ the “pure lip” or pure speech, that stand firm against the Devil and all his agents, and that continue to declare the name of the Lord and his kingdom. Only such survive Armageddon. They continue their songs of praise unitedly until then and after. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/4.0</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">One of Satan’s chief means of deception is to keep the people always in ignorance of the truth concerning his organization, particularly concerning Babylon. The Scriptures definitely state that Babylon must be in existence at the end of Satan’s world, at which time it must be and shall be destroyed. The highest development and most seductive form of Satan’s visible organization is “Christendom”. Ancient Babylon’s same Devil-religion doctrine of “immortality of all human souls” is today the fundamental doe-trine of so-ealled .“Christendom”, and which proves that “Christendom” is modern-day Babylon. “Christendom” offers no protection whatever to the people against demonism, but rather leads the people right into the trap of Satan and his associate demons, and for this reason becomes one of the chief means of hurrying the nations into destruction.

<p><span class="font5">Do you believe that Jehovah God, by Christ Jesus, will within a very short time avenge his elect and thus vindicate his own great and holy name? “According to your faith be it unto you.” If you have faith in the prophetic utterances of the Lord, then you will understand why these terrible conditions now exist and you will read with real joy what God’s Word declares shall shortly come to pass. You will be assured that all things shall work together for your good because you love God and have been called according to his purpose, and that, come what may, the final result will be glorious to those who stand firm on the side of The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font5">That hatred on the part of the ruling element of the nations is not because Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are bad or do anything to interfere with personal or property rights of the people, or do anything against the general welfare of the people. That hatred is because His witnesses and companions boldly proclaim the name of Jehovah God and his King, Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus was hated and persecuted when on earth. No religious institution nor any members thereof suffer as did Christ Jesus and for the same reason. No religious system or institution or members thereof proclaim the name of Jehovah, the great Theocrat, and announce his Theocratic Government by his King. As to The Theocracy, religious institutions are either silently or openly in opposition; therefore they do not and can not suffer for righteousness’ sake and for proclamation of His name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the time of Christ’s coming and kingdom there are on earth those who are of good-will toward God, but who cannot be made members of the heavenly class, that is, Zion, which heavenly class is God’s “little flock” Of sheep and to which the promise is made: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12: 32) Jesus said he had another class called “sheep” that he would call, and to whom he would give salvation: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice.” These “other sheep”, proving faithful under the test, will form the “great multitude” and proclaim the name of God and Christ; and such persons have the promise that they shall live forever on the earth and fill the earth with a righteous people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/40</span></p>

It is that sacred Word of God that makes one wise nnto salvation through faith in Jehovah’s Anointed One. By bringing to pass and revealing the physical facts in fulfillment God makes known to the teachable the meaning of his prophecies written long ago in his Word. Jehovah often uses his devoted people by permitting them to pass through certain experiences and thus to have some part in the fulfillment of his prophecy, and then later he shows them how the prophecy has been fulfilled and how his faithful people are related thereto. Such knowledge, because it proceeds from Jehovah, is pure and true, and gives great comfort and hope to those who worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth.

<p><span class="font5">Now the religious Hierarchy are being called to account by the Lord, who is causing his message to be delivered among them, yet they make themselves believe they are so thoroughly fixed that they cannot be moved. They conclude that the Lord is satisfied with their course of action and will let them stay put, and will do no good to them, will not improve their condition or the people’s condition to make them free from dictators religious and political; and that he will do them no evil, but let them stay where they are.

Concerning the faithful anointed it is written: “In thy name shall they rejoice all the day; and in thy righteousness [vindication] shall they be exalted.” (89: 16) Their joy is solely in “Thy salvation”, that salvation that belongs only to Jehovah. As the “feet” of Christ Jesus the faithful remnant now ‘publish salvation’, and with full confidence in The Theocratic Government they proclaim to those who will hear: “Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”-Isa. 52:7; Rom. 10:13.

Now Jehovah’s witnesses are marching around Jericho, proclaiming the King’s message, and soon the marching will be done. Then the battle of the great day of God Almighty will be on. Then will the shout and sound of the trumpet be given as Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, leads his heavenly host to complete victory. It will be a shout of victory and the sound of the trumpet of triumph. That will mark the complete downfall of “Christendom” and of every part of Satan’s organization.

Christ Jesus defends and protects those who seek meekness and who are therefore anxious to be guided in the right way. (Ps. 45: 4) The meek diligently obey the Lord and follow his instructions which come from him through his organization. These must be willing to follow organization instructions and not try to run ahead of the Lord and do the Lord’s work in their own way. Meekness is the very opposite of pride or self-importance or the manifestation of that “know-it-all” spirit. One who finds fault with others, and particularly who objects to having organization instructions given to him or called to his attention, is proud, self-important, and not meek. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/40</span></p>

Will these know and rely upon the divine promises, disregard everything contrary to God’s Word, and go straight forward in full obedience to God’s commandments, regardless of what the opposition may be? Will there be some who will maintain their integrity toward God under the most trying conditions? Such is the very point raised by Jesus’ words: “Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth ?” Who today has this strong, abiding faith? “According to your faith be it unto you.” —Luke 18: 8; Matt. 9: 29.

With Christ Jesus these shall have to do with aiding the “great multitude” to carry out their assigned duties. Thus those of good-will shall be brought into the Lord’s fold and ultimately they shall be all of one fold and all shall be under one shepherd or king.

Giving honor to man or any creature and looking upon such a one as the leadei* or teacher, is disregarding instruction of the Lord, and is a failure to give Him the praise and honor that is due. Practitioners of religion are in darkness and cannot understand.

Therefore the Lord, being at the temple as the representative of the Most High, is in the midst of “Christendom”, not dwelling there, but as causing the present judgment of her. (Ps. 82: 1-3) This puts God near and affords “Christendom” an opportunity to hear and to know the truth. God and Christ Jesus are just and righteous and do no iniquity. He will do no iniquity, because God is upright. “He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.” (Ps. 92: 15) Exactly opposite to the righteous Lord, “Christendom” is designated as “the oppressing city”, or the organization that oppresses and does evil to mankind.—Zeph. 3:1.

It is their high duty and responsibility to comfort and edify one another by speaking together of the great truths which Jehovah through Christ Jesus now reveals to those of this day.

<p><span class="font5">Being both righthanded and lefthanded appears to have been a favor especially given to the tribe of Benjamin: &quot;They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.” (1 Chron. 12:2; Judg. 20:16) Those fellows were sure shots. Thus favored, Ehud was equipped to meet any attack from either side and also to surprise the enemy by his manner of attack. Ehud played the part in the drama picturing Christ Jesus and also including the members of &quot;the body of Christ” on the earth from and after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the gathering unto himself of the faithful anointed ones who become members of “his body”.

<p><span class="font5">That emphatic declaration from God’s Word alone settles the question as to who will be saved and who will perish at Armageddon. What can be said of the combination made up of Fascists, Nazis, Communists, Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and other opponents of The Theocracy? It is certain that salvation cannot come to any of them. It is likewise absolutely certain that none of that organization can minister salvation to any other creature. Salvation belongs alone to the Almighty God. No one can find peace and life everlasting by adhering to that religious, political combination. That organization of the enemy holds out absolutely no hope whatsoever, because it is Satan’s organization and Satan is against The Theocracy. That organization hates the name of Jehovah and his King. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Modern-day Philistines having been destroyed, their house will be completely desolated. No more will there be any thieves and racketeers. The cities once occupied and controlled by the religious, political and commercial oppressors will be for ever gone, and then, as stated by the prophet, the faithful people of God shall “lie down in the evening”. That would clearly indicate peace and rest and safety. No more shall they fear the beastly giants, like Goliath, the antitype of whom is the monstrosity, the totalitarian rulers. The people of good-will who then are obedient to God’s command shall receive his blessings. These are the ones that have sought righteousness and meekness and who may “be hid”, and then they shall dwell in peace and security forever on the earth.

<p><span class="font5">God’s people now on earth see that the Watchtower Society is merely a visible channel, means or instrument to transmit Jehovah’s message to his people. For this reason each one keenly desires to be in complete harmony with his organization and work under the Lord’s supervision. Any work that is contrary to Jehovah and his great Theocratic organization is of the enemy, the Devil, and such work the remnant refuse to have any part in whatsoever. They thus refuse because they know God and Christ Jesus will not be with them if they depart in any manner whatever from full and united support of The Theocratic Government. They firmly stand for The Theocracy. This brings the remnant into great disrepute among the religionists; but these faithful servants of God care not for any worldly approval.

All persons now with real faith in God and Christ will stand firm against all opposition and persecution and will permit nothing to drive them away from faithful service of the Most High. They will confidently rely upon him for deliverance and salvation and will wait for him, well knowing that in his own due time and good way he will fully avenge the wrongs of all those who love and serve him. They can see now that the Devil is attempting to destroy particularly the servants of God and his King, and that soon God through Christ will fight against the enemy as he did in times of old, and completely cut the enemy to pieces, and deliver those faithful to The Theocracy. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1/41 They shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.

The ruling elements have builded many houses, palaces, and cathedrals. They shall not control them, but their rule shall quickly end. The rulers, religious and political, think they are laying the foundation for an everlasting “good time”. Such builders take all the credit to themselves. Jehovah is not in their thoughts. They give to men, particularly themselves, all credit for the building and all the wealth and all the prospects of the future. They boast of what the rulers shall soon do. Jehovah and his Kingdom they do not take into account at all. They know not the day of their visitation. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah says to the rebellious ones: “Just wait for me.” But rebellious “Christendom” gives no heed to the warning. The religionists and allies increase persecution upon Jehovah's witnesses. Will he avenge his faithful witnesses? Jesus answers: “I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?” (Luke 18: 8) Those now on earth who have full faith and confidence m Jehovah and his King will not longer fear demons nor human agents of the demons, but with boldness and zeal peculiar to the house of God will go forth proclaiming the message committed to their hands, declaring God’s purpose. By so doing they will prove their faith in Jehovah and in his government, and will thereby maintain their integrity toward the Most High.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 3:13, Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The remnant must not “speak lies”: the preaching of any religious doctrine; or adding to God’s Word anything like that of “the 'Great Pyramid’ witness”, as though it taught a doctrine of the Lord; or such things as “character development”. The Lord has turned to his people a “pure lip”; “neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth.” The faithful remnant are not guilty of having sworn a vow of consecration to the Lord and thereafter failing to carry out that vow. They do not take the name of God in vain by failing or refusing to be active witnesses to the name of Jehovah. They are true witnesses of the Lord. The Lord’s angels cleared out all the “evil servant”, who by good words and fair speech deceived the hearts of the simple.—Rom. 16:17, 18. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Concerning the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses it is written that such have been “caught up together . . . with the Lord” in the temple and there they are made to dwell in safety in “the secret place of the Most High”, where no harm or evil shall befall them. (1 Thess. 4:17) The Lord’s “other sheep” have fled to The Theocracy, and there they have the promise of being hid and kept in safety until the wrath of God is passed. All the evidence tends to prove that Armageddon is very near. Let those who fully trust in Jehovah and his King remain calm, steadfast, and faithful. The “sign” is certain to be made manifest in the near future. Religionists will then be saying, “Peace and safety,” and will try to make themselves believe they are in safety and at peace.

<p><span class="font5">It is absolutely certain that quite soon God’s wrath against all enemies will be forcefully expressed, but that wrath is not against those who love him. Willful opposers of The Theocracy are designated as ‘Tirute beasts, made to be . . . destroyed”. (2 Pet. 2:12) Jehovah has been long-suffering with such “vessels of wrath”, fitted for destruction, and now the day of reckoning is near when he will clear out the enemy. But that wrath is not for his faithful servants. Instead, God has provided salvation for those who love and serve him. It is now the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. He “died for us”, and all those who remain true and steadfast in their devotion and service to him have full assurance of salvation and deliverance.

<p><span class="font5">Ehud’s escape pictures the members of Jehovah’s witnesses escaping from the vicious servants of religionists, bent upon their destruction. Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have had a part in thrusting the “sword of the spirit” into the belly of the religious systems. While doing so, they have been severely reproached, ill-treated and put in very great danger; yet by God’s grace they have escaped through it all and will continue to escape until their work is finished, before Armageddon begins. Then the door opens and the allies of the big religious system see the real situation of the religious institution. They are enraged against everything that appears to be religious. Being influenced by the demons, they put forth their efforts to make an end of Jehovah’s witnesses, even as the servants of Eglon pursued after Ehud. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W10/15/40</span></p>

Those of good-will do not look to religion or politics to save them, but they say, as it is written: “He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death.” (68:20) This is a time of great distress upon the people, and for those of good-will it is written: “Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.” (70:4) Everyone of good-will desires to put himself under the Lord’s protection and to become one of God’s people, and all such are assured that if they seek after the Lord in his appointed way they shall find him and receive his favor. “He will beautify the meek with salvation.”—149: 4.

<p><span class="font5">This warning from the Lord means that every person who will maintain his integrity toward Jehovah and receive God’s final approval through Christ Jesus must separate himself and hold himself entirely separate from all things that pertain to demonism. Therefore he must shun religion and everything pertaining to religion, and put his trust wholly and completely in the great Theocrat and his government. This warning does not come from men, but is from the Almighty God himself. Without any doubt, the Lord has in these latter days made his people to have a clear understanding that religion is of the Devil and is in violent opposition to Christianity, and this He has done in order that those consecrated to him may escape from the power and influence of the demons.

Jehovah is manifesting his good pleasure toward his servants because of their fearlessness and faithfulness in advertising The Theocratic Government and declaring the name of the great Theo-crat. Those faithful servants fear Jehovah, lest they should come short of service and not receive his approval. They delight to do his will amidst all opposition. God’s favor is made known to the faithful by giving them a “new name”, the witnesses of Jehovah. Because Jehovah rejoices over his faithful people he bids them that are his witnesses on the earth to rejoice also, and they do greatly rejoice now. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/40</span></p>

Religionists could not well proclaim “Peace and safety” unless they had the co-operation of political, commercial, judicial and other elements of Satan’s visible organization. Together they will take bold action against Jehovah’s witnesses. When Armageddon begins, there will be a quick turning of the secular element against the clergy, the religious leaders; because it is written: “God hath put [it] in their hearts to fulfil his will.” (Rev. 17:16, 17) It is reasonable that he will cause some supernatural demonstration, striking terror to such secular element, and cause them to realize they have been woefully deceived by clergy prognostications; therefore they will turn suddenly upon the religious leaders and destroy them.

There were those who forsook Saul, David’s enemy, and took their stand with David and served with him, and they also received salvation in mercy. (1 Chron 12:1-22) So likewise Jehovah grants salvation in mercy to the “remnant”, who are of the antitypical David class, and to the “companions” of the remnant, who are of the antitypical Jonathan class. Those who are of Jehovah’s organization, and those who put themselves under that organization, and who continue faithfully to serve God, may confidently expect to receive the mercy of the Most High.

The modern-day monstrosity, the totalitarian form of government, includes religious, political, commercial and military elements. It includes individuals which go to make up the “inhabitants” of that godless, demon-controlled system.

The enemies of God walk on in darkness, and Satan, the chief one of the devils or demons, is deceiving them and leading them in darkness, and all the demons associated with the Devil are in darkness and all are workers of iniquity or wickedness. They all work against Jehovah God and those who serve him. The purpose of the Devil and his agents in keeping men blind is to bring about the destruction of mankind. God’s Word is the truth, and alone can enlighten men, showing them the right way. God’s Word of truth must be the guide of all who will now find the right way and escape the impending disaster.

<p><span class="font5">In this day, when Jehovah is doing his “strange work”, he causes his lamp, that is, his Word, to plainly guide his servants. By the proclaiming of God’s Word of truth among the people religion and its practice are exposed to view and the people who are of good-will learn the truth that religion is a snare and a racket, and they learn what is God’s purpose toward them that obey him. God’s light, therefore, discloses that religion practiced by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is concealed or hidden by lies and that such hiding place of lies will be swept away by the truth. Jehovah’s light causes the enemies of The Theocratic Government to be exposed. Hence the enemies are forced right out into the open. Thus the Lord searches out “Christendom”.

In every instance where one has been blinded by the demons and later becomes a Christian and is enlightened by the’Lord and faithfully serves him, the demons are enraged against that faithful person and attempt to destroy him. No one who consecrates himself to do God’s will can possibly prove his integrity unless he spurns religion and faithfully and earnestly serves Jehovah as a follower of Christ. Furthermore, the Scriptures show that when one has become a Christian and falls away he becomes the easy instrument of the demons and he appears to be beyond recovery because sinning against light. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/40</span></p>

They are weak and poor in themselves, and all their strength is in the Lord, upon whom they depend.

Jehovah God long ago made a prophetic picture of the place of refuge by setting up “cities of refuge” wherein refuge might be found and there protection be given. Those cities of refuge pictured God’s organization, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. (Num. 35:6-12) Jehovah God is over all, and he is the great refuge of those who are oppressed by the enemy and who are of good-will toward Him, seeking to know and to serve the Lord; and all these blessings he administers through Christ Jesus.—Pss. 9:9, 62:8.

They know that it could not come to a close until God’s due time. By his Servant and Vindicator, Christ Jesus, Jehovah is carrying out his purpose. He makes no mistakes. Nothing can come to pass without the permission of God and his King.

The responsibility is upon “Christendom”, and upon her clergy in particular. She continues in her course of wickedness; and, says the prophet, “the unjust knoweth no shame.” The clergy and the principal of their floek have no shame before the Lord, but in the face of all his warnings they continue to practice religion, the worship of demons.

It is made prominently to appear in the Scriptures and many times is brought to the attention of the people, because it is the last opportunity for those who now hear the message to ever get life. It is the great event that shall for ever establish the supremacy of Jehovah and completely vindicate his name. Holy angels and faithful men have for long looked forward to this great and terrible day. Now it is very near. The faithful on earth see it and rejoice.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">~Wait on the Lord, and keep his way.—Ps. 37:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that Jehovah will soon vindicate his holy name and avenge his faithful servants, the “remnant” and their “companions” calmly and serenely wait on the Lord. To those of good-will Jehovah, by Christ Jesus, now says: “Come out of her [Satan’s organization], my people.” The “great multitude” are coming and together with the remnant are rejoicing and singing Jehovah’s praises and unto his King. When Jehovah is making inquisition preparatory to destroying the wicked he will not forsake the humble or obedient ones. Over them is his protecting hand. He will shield them from the enemy assaults and bring them off victorious through Christ Jesus, and provide a place of safety for those persons of good-will who fully devote themselves to him. By faith these see the day of deliverance is near. While waiting, they seek righteousness and meekness. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The man . . . reported the matter, saying, 1 have done as thou hast commanded me.—Ezek. 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jehovah’s witnesses have obeyed his commandment to tell the truth as long as the opportunity is left open, their responsibility ends, because as soon as the witness work is completed God will exercise his unlimited power in vindicating his name. Then he will assign to his faithful servants other work to do. As they now go forward in publishing The Theocracy it is for those who hear the message to elect to either serve God and live or reject the message, remain where they are, and suffer eternal death. The witnesses, having faithfully performed their commision and duty, will then rest content as to whatever may be the result. They ask no favors of men, but ask only to be given a respectful hearing as representatives of the Lord. They know his will shall be accomplished. With that they are content. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">As soon as they legin to say, Peace! and safety! then suddenly upon them cometh destruction, just as the birth-throe.—1 Thess. 5:3, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time arrives when opposers of The Theocratic Government think they have accomplished their purpose and they say, “Peace and safety1” Just how long they will be saying that before the battle of Armageddon begins is not definitely indicated by the Scriptures. That they will be so saying shortly before the battle is quite certain and clear. It is not a matter of ‘Maybe they will say so’; but of a certainty they will be permitted by the Lord to come to the point where they feel they have accomplished their purpose and when they will certainly say so. But “they speak not peace [to the advocates of The Theocracy]; but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land”. (Ps. 35:20) Only those who fully trust in Jehovah will be quiet in the land, looking to God for deliverance. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/40</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">To obey is better than sacrifice, . . . For the sin of witchcraft is rebellion, and idolatry and imageworship, stubbornness.—1 Sam. 15:22, 23, Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The person who willfully refuses to hear and obey the truth of God’s Word when the truth is presented to him thereby opens the door and invites the demons to come in. The demons then obsess him, that is, besiege his mind and bring that creature under their control. Many who think themselves servants of God are stubborn and rebellious, refusing to obey God’s Word, and thus yield to demon influence. Therefore let those who earnestly desire safety and protection be diligent to seek and to do what is right and to ascertain from God’s Word what is the right course, and be willing and anxious to hear and to obey the Word of God, because their hearing and obedience are better than all the sacrifice they could perform. The stubborn will perish at Armageddon. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I will take away . . . the stumblingblocks, even them who are lawless.—Zeph. 1:3, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such stumbling-blocks have reached the climax in the idolatrous, religion used and practiced by the Roman Catholic 'Hierarchy. The Roman Catholic Action, put into operation by the Hierarchy, has laid the great stumbling-block before the people that has put fear into the minds and hearts of multitudes, deluded them, and caused them to fall into the snare or pit of the Devil. Such stumbling-block God will destroy by the hand of Christ Jesus before or at Armageddon. Money, or “the love of money” and what it brings, otherwise called “commercialism”, is another of the stumblingblocks. Such, says Ezekiel 7:19, is 'the stumblingbloek of their lawlessness’. Having fixed their heart upon money and what it can bring, they have stumbled over the same, have been-caught in the Devil’s snare, and will be destroyed at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh [city of refuge]; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet; and Deborah went up with him.—Judg. 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time had come for God’s people to move into action. “And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh,” that is, to the city of refuge. She did not stay at home and rest under the palm tree, but went into the field with the others who went into action. Likewise Jehovah’s invisible organization and the visible part thereof are with Christ Jesus and go into active service and serve under him. He is accompanied by all his holy angels who are of his organization, and by the resurrected members of “his body” and all the remnant on earth. Jehovah’s spirit is with his organization, and all are at peace and work in exact harmony. The Lord Jesus and his true followers delight to be obedient to Jehovah’s commandments Barak showed such willingness by immediately obeying.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, that all may call upon the name of the Lord, and may serve him with one shoulder.—Zeph. 3:9, Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The dividing line must be clearly marked. A great gulf is between those who oppose and those who are fully devoted to The Theocracy. Therefore the Lord turns to his people a pure lip and a pure speech, “that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.” (A.V.) First, those of the “remnant” are brought into full unity in Christ; and then come those who will form the “great multitude”. The world is under the dominating control of demons and therefore in confusion. These human creatures in confusion are not and will not be converted to righteousness. Only those of good-will, who turn to the Lord and seek righteousness and meekness, have any prospect of understanding and being hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">That they may be one, even as we are one.-John 17:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah the Almighty God and Christ Jesus are one. Said Jesus: “I and my Father are one.” (10: 30) Jehovah is the Father; Jesus is the Son. Jehovah is without beginning and without end, therefore “from everlasting”. (Ps. 90: 2) Christ Jesus is the beginning of Jehovah’s creation. (Rev. 3; 14) Jesus said: “My Father is greater than I.” How, then, are Father and Son one ? In this: that they are in full harmony and complete unity. The Father and the Son are in complete unanimity, or oneness. Christ Jesus the Son always obeys the will of Jehovah God: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” (John 6:38) Jehovah is the great Theoerat. Christ Jesus is the King acting for The Theo-crat. The Theocracy is the government of Jehovah performed by and through Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">Fea, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I will grant you to become a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I cause them of your captivities to return before your eyes, saith Jehovah.—Zeph. 3:20, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Had all the consecrated in 1918 taken a course of idleness and never thereafter organized and carried forward the witness work in a zealous and fearless manner, no one on earth would have seen or known of the restoration of spiritual Israel and that these are the true servants of Jehovah God, who declare his name and government. There could have been no restoration were it not that some remained true and faithful to the Lord and these constituted the “remnant”. In 1919 these were restored, their restraint being removed. Thus the faithful were made a praise to Jehovah’s name. Religionists and others were made to realize that now there is a people on earth wholly devoted to Jehovah and who without fear or hesitation proclaim his name and advertise The Theocratic Government as the only hope of mankind.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And they went down after him.—Judg. 3:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ehud there took the lead and the faithful Israelites followed him in the war. So now the Greater Ehud, Christ Jesus, summons his faithful followers. He takes the lead and says to those who have covenanted to do the will of God: “Follow me.” The faithful on earth obey his command. The host of heaven hear the command of the great Executioner, and to them he says: “Follow after me.” The hour has arrived for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Christ Jesus leads on to battle. Those who are with Christ Jesus and who remain faithful and true will now falter not. Concerning them it is written: “These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.”—Rev. 14:4.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">They ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.—Judg. 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deborah was the wife of Lapidoth, whose name means “lamps, torches”, that is, instruments of enlightenment. Doubtless mention is made of him as Deborah’s husband to show she was not a widow, forsaken and abandoned, hence not a sorrowing woman. In Israel it was a reproach to be a widow. His name meaning “lamps, light”, Lapidoth well pictures Jehovah, “the Father of lights,” the husband of his organization Zion, which organization is pictured by his woman. Now God causes the salvation of Zion to shine forth “as a lamp that burneth”. Deborah therefore pictured Jehovah’s organization: “for thy maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name.” (Isa. 54: 5) It does not appear that the Israelites called Deborah “mother”, but the drama shows she pictured Zion, God’s organization, which is the mother of spiritual Israelites, and through which God judges his people.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses must keep in mind that they are the ambassadors of The Theocratic Government, which government is bitterly opposed by the entire world. They are doing a good work, engaged, by the grace of Jehovah, in his “strange work”. They must keep in mind that his hand is over them and his strength is manifested for them. They have the assurance that his supreme power shall be exercised in their behalf in due time. The faithful are in the light and walking in the day. They know what the action of the enemy means. The enemy endeavors to prevail against God’s people who now joyfully support The Theocracy. The enemy shall fail. The faithful servants of Jehovah fully trust him and continue to say: ‘My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.” They know deliverance is certain to come at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host.—Judg.4:14,15,A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Doubtless the host under Sisera began to flee to the hills, or wherever they could go to escape the storm. Barak and his army quickly followed them up, and this at God’s command. Here is pictured the present-day movement of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, spiritual Israelites, advancing steadfastly with unbroken ranks, pressing the battle to the gate against demonism or religion. They go on regardless of apparently overwhelming opposition. Against the refuge of lies they and their companions now press the battle, by heralding the message of Jehovah’s kingdom against the enemy fortifications. This immediately precedes the victorious assault of the Greater Barak, which shall result in complete destruction of the enemy forces at Armageddon. Jehovah has given his word that he will fight for his people at Armageddon. W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 10:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy today wrongfully charge Jehovah’s witnesses with intolerance toward Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. The facts are that Jehovah’s witnesses are intolerant to no one. They hold that every one has the right to freely express himself and that the teachings or doctrines put forth by any person or system may properly and freely be criticized. In no other way can the people learn just now which is correct. Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim the truth as written in the Scriptures, and which God commands all his covenant people to proclaim at the present time. Those who 'have a desire to learn and who therefore have an ear to hear will give heed to what is published. No others will give heed. It is Jehovah who spoke the things against the religionists that oppose The Theocracy. His true servants on earth merely proclaim the message which God himself gives.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price.—Isa. 55:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who receive the Lord’s blessings do so without money consideration. They “buy” with full devotion and service to the great Theocrat and his King. Therefore all persons of good-will join in the service and say to others: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” That is, all join in directing the people to the way of refuge and safety under God’s organization, and all together they say: “Whosoever will [who is of goodwill toward God], let him take the water of life [truth] freely.” Salvation is free to those who give their heart devotion to God and his King. Everyone who takes his stand on the side of The Theocracy and supports it and who therefore serves God, in spirit and in truth, shall find salvation. Their devotion and service to the great Theocrat and his King brings to them marvelous blessings. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A wise son heareth his father's instruction. —Prov. 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the Father of those who are devoted to him and instructs those who are diligent to ascertain and to do his will. The son is the one who has the promise of life everlasting conditioned upon his knowledge of God and his obedience to the law of God. He must prove his love for God and maintain his integrity toward the Most High. A person is wise only when guided by the Word of God. It is essential, therefore, that the person who would be wise must study God’s Word and sincerely endeavor to receive God’s approval In harmony with this conclusion the faithful servant of the Lord, Paul, admonishes as follows: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”—2 Tim. 2:15.

<p><span class="font5">When the “sign” of Armageddon clearly appears may it not then be that the Lord’s promise above applies to his people? There are still opportunities of service. None of the faithful will neglect to avail themselves of such. We may be sure that to his people who are sober and watchful the Lord will make clear the “sign” immediately preceding the beginning of the battle of that great day. Constant vigilance and watchfulness are very necessary now, also complete and entire trust and confidence in the Lord. For many centuries lovers of righteousness have centered their hearts and hopes upon The Theocracy. By their lifeblood they have borne testimony to their faith in and devotion to that blessed government. Now the great Theocracy under Christ the King is here. His rule shall endure fox ever and fill earth with joy and a people to God’s praise. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those who practice religion rely upon their religious organization to provide for them protection and salvation. Such are doomed to complete disappointment, and their end is destruction. Those of the “evil servant” class are also religionists, who rely upon their own ability to develop character that will insure them the protection and salvation from Jehovah God. They too will be sorely disappointed. They often deceive themselves to the point of advocating “universal salvation”, falsely claiming that the love of God provides salvation for the Devil himself, and this they do in the face of God’s plain declaration, “All the wicked will he destroy.” Jehovah God is the source of life. He grants salvation only to the obedient ones through Christ Jesus. Those devoted to Jehovah, in the language of his prophet, truly say: “Behold, God is my salvation.”—Isa. 12: 2.
