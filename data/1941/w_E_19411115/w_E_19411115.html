<p><span class="font0">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, Is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose, duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”—Ps. 53:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TEHOVAH’S description of creatures is such that I it is easy to locate them by the course of action </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font4"> they take. It is not necessary for such creatures to speak audible words, since the heart represents the motive: “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh” and the course of action is directed. (Matt. 12:34) Consequently, as one goes about his affairs he shows whether he has faith in Almighty God or not. This is as true with reference to a composite body as with a single individual. The wise creature is guided by the Word of Jehovah God. The fool shuns the Word of God. If any sane person thinks he has reason to doubt that “the king of the north” (Dan. 11:40) is a fool, and therefore the instrument of the Devil, let him measure that composite body by the scriptures that follow, to wit:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> “The fool rageth, and is confident.” (Prov. 14:16) The composite body of “the king of the north” now rages against many people and nations and is very confident of success, whereas his defeat is certain. The fool is wicked, and his way is darkness, and he walks on in darkness. (Prov. 4:19; Eccl. 2:14) It is certain that he shall perish.—Prov. 10: 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The heart of the creature stands for his motive or purpose, and according to his action he may be identified. “The worthless fool saith in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and they are abominable (in their) injustice: there is none that doth good.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font4"> “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity.” (Ps. 53:1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Auth. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> “They are corrupt, and they are abominable in their injustice.” This scripture text exactly describes “the king of the north”, composed of Nazis, Fascists and the Hierarchy combine. Both their claim and their work are iniquitous and are an abomination in the sight of Almighty God. By their course of action this combine says: “There is no Almighty Jehovah.” They go exactly contrary to the Word of God. They afflict the people with gross injustice. A more minute description of “the king of the north” given in the prophecy of Daniel proves beyond all doubt that that “king” and every element thereof emphatically deny that Jehovah is the Supreme One and that Christ Jesus is His Kling, who shall rule the world in righteousness. The religious leaders of the combine, that is, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in particular, claim to represent Christ Jesus; but that claim is entirely false. The Hierarchy justifies the action of “the king of the north” and publicly prays for the “new League of Nations”, which is the “new order”, so called, of “the king of the north”; and the Hierarchy also prays for the re-establishment of the “old Holy Roman Empire”, which at all times has been devoted entirely to blasphemous action and gross iniquity. At the same time the Hierarchy condemns and persecutes everyone who advocates the kingdom of God by Christ Jesus, and which is The Theocracy for which Christ Jesus taught all of his true followers to earnestly pray: “He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord.”—Prov. 17:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">‘ The poor people of many nations now greatly suffer at the hand of “the king of the north”: “As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.”—Prov. 28:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah has put these unchangeable rules in the Bible for the aid and comfort of those who desire righteousness, and by which they may be guided in the way of righteousness; and the reason for calling attention to the same here is that those who love righteousness may see the wickedness of “the king of the north” and of every element thereof and, seeing the same, quickly flee from that iniquitous religious influence and find refuge in The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Return now to the consideration of the prophecy of Daniel and mark how completely the events that are now daily coming to light show the fulfillment of that prophecy dictated by Jehovah and written down in the centuries past.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> “Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.” (Dan. 11: 37) The “fathers” of “Christendom”, that is, the chief religious element of “the king of the north”, once sought to worship Almighty God with religion and the traditions of men; but the modern-day “Catholic Action” is political and the feigned worship of God is only with outward signs and words, all of which are an abomination in Jehovah’s sight. “In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments [the precepts] of men.”—Matt. 15:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> The Hebrew word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Elohim</span><span class="font4"> is rendered “God”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Elohim</span><span class="font4"> refers to the Creator of heaven and earth, and the Creator of man. He is the Maker of the everlasting covenant concerning created life. He is the Almighty God, to whom belongs the earth and the fullness thereof. “The king of the north” has no regard for Him, the Almighty Creator, but, on the contrary, by its course of action every element of “the king of the north&quot; denies the supremacy of Jehovah, the Almighty God. “The king of the north” is very destructive of human life, having no regard for God’s living creatures, which God’s everlasting covenant forbids to be wantonly killed, as the “Axis powers” are now doing. With the full connivance and approval of the religious Hierarchy this abominable iniquity is carried on throughout the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>8</sup> “Zion” is the creation and upbuilding of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Elohim, </span><span class="font4">the Almighty God, and is the official residence of the Most High, as He has declared. “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” (Ps. 102:16) “In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwellingplace in Zion.” (Ps. 76: 2) “For the Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.”—Ps. 132:13,14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* Zion is Jehovah’s official government, of which Christ Jesus is The King. It is The Theocracy, and that righteous government is viciously opposed by “the king of the north”, and particularly the religious element thereof. Even the pope and the other members of the Hierarchy are contemptuous of God’s creation and building. While hypocritically operating under the cloak of religion they, together with other elements of “the king of the north”, ride roughshod over everything animate or inanimate to the end that they might satisfy their ambition for world domination. This is proved by their wicked and cruel persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, his faithful servants, which servants of God they persecute solely for the reason that those servants announce Jehovah’s name and his Kingdom. They support the totalitarian and cruel wars that are wickedly carried on by the Nazis and Fascists against the democracies, or governments for and by the people. They utterly disregard the rights of the people which God has bestowed upon them. They control the public prejss to a large degree and see to it that the press aids them in keeping the people in the dark by giving wide publication to the Hierarchy’s vain prayers for peace and for “the pope’s sorrowing heart”, and crocodile tears, publicly shed. Thus every element of “the king of the north”, the composite body, shows no regard for Almighty God; and that shows, on the authority of God’s Word, that “the king of the north” is a fool, which fool is condemned to everlasting destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup>“Nor the desire of women.” (Dan. 11:37) This part of the prophetic text does not refer to the female sex. “The king of the north” is not an individual man, but a composite personage. The “women” of the text, therefore, means organizations which God has created and which sincerely and honestly men have builded up by the grace and direction of the Lord. Both Mussolini and Franco of the “Axis powers” are married men with families, and members of the Hierarchy have their dealings with the opposite sex, which dealings, of course, are not fully and publicly revealed. So the text could not refer literally to men’s disregard for the opposite sex. As an illustration, the organization of the American government has always insisted on keeping the state and religion, called “the church”, entirely separate, but the Hierarchy now induces the politicians of America to cry out: “We must have more religion, else we perish.” The Hierarchy tries to put religion in politics and sets up a bogeyman called “Communism”, with which to frighten the politicians into a closer relationship of the church, politically, and state. Thus it is seen that the Hierarchy has no regard for any organization of the people that is righteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The “women”, whose desire “the king” does not regard, without any doubt, refers to God’s organization. His organization Zion is pictured by good women; that is, it was foreshadowed by Sarah and Rachel. The “desire” of these women is for children for God’s service and to the vindication of his name. (Gen. 30:1-3; Rom. 7:4) Sarah pictured God’s “woman”, Zion, which is the mother of Christ and the 144,000 members of “his body”, therefore The Christ, and which includes the faithful remnant yet on the earth. Likewise Keturah (Gen. 25:1,2) and Rachel (Gen. 35:16-19) pictured members of Jehovah’s capital organization which are brought in later. (See the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” At Revelation twelve God’s woman Zion is pictured as bringing forth the “man-child”, which is God’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The “remnant of her seed” is described in Revelation 12:17, against which the enemy makes war. Now “the king of the north” fights against the “manchild” of The Theocratic Government and desires to destroy it to the end that the “Axis powers” might rule the world contrary to Jehovah’s will. Therefore the effort to suppress the message concerning The Theocracy, which effort is put forth with all possible vigor by the elements of “the king of the north”. The Devil sends forth “the king of the north”, particu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">larly the Hierarchy element thereof, to destroy the remnant of God's capital organization yet on earth, to which remnant is committed “the testimony of Jesus Christ’’ and the work of proclaiming that message to the peoples of earth who have a hearing ear. Thus “the king of the north” shows absolutely no regard for “women”, that is, for God's organization. The arrogant and foolish course of “the king of the north” is further indicated by that part of the text describing him, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is “N<sub>or</sub> regard any god.” The Hebrew word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">elodh </span><span class="font4">is here used, and is translated by the English word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">god.</span><span class="font4"> In the book of Job, in connection with the drama therein set out, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">eloah</span><span class="font4"> is used forty-one times; and it is used to identify any mighty one, whether visible or invisible. It is used ten other times referring to Jehovah God. Hence the words “any god” used in this text of the prophecy of Daniel appear to mean any mighty one within Jehovah's organization, to wit, Christ Jesus in particular, whose name, as the prophecy declares, shall be called “Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God”. (Isa. 9:6) He is the Chief One, who as a man maintained flawless or complete his integrity toward Jehovah, and is therefore the mighty Vindicator of Jehovah’s name.—Heb. 5: 8,9; Rev. 19:11-21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> “The king of the north” has no regard for the Lord Jesus Christ as the Mighty God who will avenge Jehovah’s name and oust everything that is contrary to Jehovah. On the contrary, that “king” viciously persecutes those who are members of The Christ, and opposes the work which the Lord has assigned to them to do in the earth in his name. (Dan. 11:33) “The king of the north” has no regard whatsoever for Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s mighty One who shall rule the world in righteousness, nor does he have regard for “the Higher Powers” of Jehovah, namely, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, but places the law of “the king of the north” above the law of God and Christ. “The king of the north” arrogantly claims to be supreme. Further describing “the king of the north”, the prophet says:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> “For he shall magnify himself above all.” “The king of the north” acknowledges none as “the higher powers”, but magnifies himself above Jehovah and above Christ Jesus by claiming that the composite “king” constitutes the higher powers, made up of superior people. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims to be the spiritual higher powers, and hence claims to be supreme on the earth and responsible to no earthly creature, organization or government on the earth. At the same time “the king of the north”, particularly the religious element thereof, practices a form of godliness, which is demonism, and which practice is done to mislead and does mislead many peoples. They deny the power of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus by spurning the Word of God and setting up themselves in the place and stead of The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The “king” combination deny the existence of the Almighty God, and hence, as the Scriptures declare, say in their heart: “There is no Almighty God.” “They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.”—Titus 1:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” They mock the Most High and his King and proceed in the way of opposition to The Theocracy, and their course of action is so terrible that the Lord describes them as abominable in their wickedness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1 T</sup> “But in his estate [in his place </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rev. Ver.</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)]</span><span class="font4"> shall he honour the God of forces; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.”—Dan. 11: 38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> This word “estate” means “official position”. “Estate” is used in the place of or for the office or position of “the king of the south” in Daniel’s prophecy (11: 7). (See verses 20, 21.) “The king of the north” disregards the position or office of The Theocracy and substitutes therefor the “abomination of desolation”. “The king of the north” honors the “god of forces”, which god does not dwell in nor receive worship in the “sanctuary of strength”, for the reason it is the “sanctuary of strength” which “the king of the north” pollutes, as the prophecy states.—Dan. 11:31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Not being the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Elohim</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Eloah</span><span class="font4"> of Jehovah’s organization, the “god of forces”, as used in the prophecy, must stand for and be, and is, the counterfeit of The Theocracy, and therefore is the “abomination of desolation”. It is the totalitarian monstrosity, the Corporate State, that rules by force and coercion and violence and by the power of armed might. It is the totalitarian strength, that is to say, the Corporate State; and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is bound to it by concordats, thereby becoming a part of the composite body which constitutes the “abomination of desolation”, because that Devilish creation stands where it ought not to stand, claiming to rule the world instead of God’s Theocratic Government. It is the totalitarian “image of the beast”, which stands in the place where it ought not to stand and thus wrongfully, blasphemously and wickedly occupies the “estate” of Jehovah, The Theocracy. (See Matthew 24:15; Mark 13:14; Revelation 13:14,15; Revelation 14:9,11; 20:4.) This totalitarian monstrosity is the image of the Devil himself, “the god of this world” of wickedness, and displays all the characteristics of the Devil. That image is something which appears in the “latter days”, meaning the present time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> “And a god [Yea, to a god </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)</span><span class="font4">; Even to a god </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)]</span><span class="font4"> whom his fathers knew not.” Those who preceded the modern-day ‘&quot;king of the north”, that is to say, “his fathers,” did not know this god, this modern monstrosity, because this “image of the beast”, this totalitarian combine, is the “abomination that maketh desolate”. That monstrosity was foretold by Jehovah’s prophets as due to be set up at the end of Satan’s world of uninterrupted rule, when the invisible Gog, the chief of demons and the official field marshal of Satan, would come to the fore and become active in carrying out Satan’s purposes. (Ezek. 38: 2, 3) It is after this “image of the beast” is set up that it is first worshiped as commanded by the Devil’s representatives; hence it was not known and worshiped by “his fathers” of the modern-day combine, nor was the prophecy relative thereto correctly understood as to the identity of the “image of the beast” until God’s due time, which due time is at the end of the world, where we now are. And how shall “the king of the north” honor this god!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> “Shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones.” That “god of forces” receives honor with the material wealth of the earth represented by gold, silver, precious stones and other substances which these things can purchase. Let all sincere persons who have been induced to believe that the pope is a wise man, and not a fool, consider the indisputable facts in the light of the prophetic utterances of Jehovah God. The pope of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which forms a part of the composite body of “the king of the north”, financed Hitler’s political campaign in 1932, when the deal was made between Hitler and Pius XI, and which deal was consummated by the then pope’s official representative, Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli. That latter named gentleman is now the head of the Hierarchy. Pius XI also financed Mussolini’s Ethiopian campaign, when that country was ruthlessly grabbed and the people robbed. Also the same pope financed and collaborated with and advised and counseled and encouraged the rebellion led by one Franco against the Spanish Republic, and in which that democracy was destroyed. Thus the totalitarian monstrosity was honored with millions of gold and silver, and like things of material value, all of which was collected by means of false pretenses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> “The king of the north” has had no regard for the gold and silver of God’s Word, nor for the precious “Corner Stone” of Zion, upon which Jehovah has builded his capital organization. (Isa. 28:16) But in order to keep up and operate the totalitarian monster, that is, the “abomination of desolation”, according to the style or ideas of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, “the king of the north” has consumed great material wealth to provide instruments of destruction rather than to provide food for the starving people. The ruling powers have extracted gold, silver, jewelry and other material wealth from the people and laid burdensome taxes upon the defenseless people, and have carried on unrighteous commercial transactions in order to accomplish its ambitious desire to carry forward a campaign to gain world domination. That combine have also seized the material wealth of the countries which have been overrun and made part of the dominion of “the king of the north”. All of this iniquitous abomination has been done and carried on with utter disregard of Almighty God and his Word, and by which course of action “the king” has said: “There is no Almighty God besides us; we are IT.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> “And pleasant things [with desirable things </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)]”-,</span><span class="font4"> that is to say, things desirable to eat and for adornment. (Dan. 10: 3; Gen. 27: 15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin; </span><span class="font4">2 Chron. 20:25) The material things which are necessary for the wealth and comfort of the people have been wrongfully seized and sacrificed to the idol of the Corporate State. Such is done to gratify the wicked ambition of the monstrosity combine and to impose upon the nations the totalitarian system in order to oppose and stave off the setting up of The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. To be sure, the “pleasant things” seized, such as butter of Denmark, upon which that people depends, and like material things from that and other nations, the totalitarian rulers continue to use for their own pleasure, while the common people, whom they have pillaged and robbed, continue to starve.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> In addition to the “pleasant things” used by the people in general, “the king of the north” has tried to take away from Jehovah’s witnesses and companions, his faithful servants who love righteousness, all the desirable spiritual food upon which those servants of God depend. In many countries they have destroyed the Bibles and ail Bible helps of these faithful servants of God and prevented them from meeting together to worship God; and this has been done in every country where the Hierarchy is able to exercise its great power. In addition thereto that monstrosity has tried to rip off the “beautiful garments”, the spiritual adornment, of God’s faithful servants by which their identification is made to appear (Isa. 52:1), and have tried to compel Jehovah’s witnesses and companions to let loose their hold upon Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. By the grace of God, however, Jehovah’s servants have been able to stand and that monstrosity has not succeeded. God’s faithful servants are determined to hold fast their integrity, come what may. They trust in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, whom they serve. Although denied the right to the possession of Bibles and Bible helps to aid them in studying the Word of God, and although denied the right to meet for study, the faithful servants of Jehovah have these great truths in their minds, which cannot be taken away from them by the Devil or any of his representatives. The monstrosity has largely succeeded, however, in taking away from the general public the spiritual food convenient for them, and this they have done by the political powers’ yielding to the religious leaders of the monstrosity. This unrighteous combination have confiscated and destroyed the printed message, which includes the Bible, and have herded faithful men and women into concentration camps to keep them away from their spiritual food and have taken the spiritual food away from the common people and destroyed it. All this “the king of the north” has done in order to please and worship the totalitarian god. (Prov. 30:8; Isa. 61:10; Matt. 22:11,12; Rev. 7: 9,13,14) The result is that there is today amongst the common people ‘a famine in the land for the hearing of the Word of the Lord’. (Amos 8:11) This famine for spiritual food, however, does not cause the faithful ones who have long been serving God to starve, because they have these truths fixed firmly in mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> In passing, the opinion is here expressed for the information of those who have hearing ears, that a great famine is certain to afflict the many nations of the earth in the very near future. The United States is also in line for much suffering. At the same time when the food supply of the world is continually growing less the government of the United States walks right into the trap of the Devil by putting in force a law which restricts the wheat supply of America and thus will in the near future make bread hard to get. If this government had not turned a deaf ear to the Bible, and had not forgotten God, the ruling factors thereof would not only have avoided Satan’s trap above mentioned, but would have encouraged and greatly increased acreage and production of wheat, and other food stuffs so much needed by the peoples of earth. Also instead of the ruling factors’ listening to the demands of religionists, particularly the Hierarchy, who form a part of “the king of the north” and who desperately attempt to keep the people in darkness concerning Jehovah’s Word and his government, this nation of the United States should have encouraged the people to give heed to the message which Jehovah has sent and is sending to them by his servants. The United States is faced with world disaster now impending and about to fall, and the only thing that can save the people from that disaster is the truth of Jehovah’s Word. Will the nation entirely forget God and suffer the evil effects of the judgment which God has pronounced against those who forget him, and which judgment long ago was written, and which judgment is now about to be enforced, to wit: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God”! (Ps. 9:17) Who, then, is wise! Let him give heed to the Word of God. And who will deny the fact that those who disregard God and his Word are fools!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">ss “Thus shall he do in the most strong holds </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[(Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)</span><span class="font4"> And he hath dealt in the fortresses of the strongholds] with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.”—Dan. 11: 39.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> This clearly foretells the action of “the king of the north” in extending the totalitarian idea of idolatry to the other nations of the earth by means of causing revolution, sabotage, “fifth column” activities, and the like, such as the Nazi, Fascist, Hierarchy propaganda and religious campaigns. That action is quickly followed up by invasion, such as was carried on against the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and other countries. Devastating propaganda is pushed with great vigor within the realm of the democracies, such as the United States and Canada, where the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have divers and numerous agents and representatives who exercise great influence and power over the public press and cause the truth to be suppressed and the people to be lulled to sleep while the totalitarian spirit continues to permeate the country without interruption. Thus “the fool” is making fools of many others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> What are the “strongholds” of a free people! The sanctity of the home devoted to God and Christ; the schools that teach the children obedience to parents in the Lord, who walk in the way of righteousness and bring up their children “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord”; the masses of the people who have had regard for the liberties of all; and the freedom of speech, of assembly and of the press, and of worship. These strongholds “the king of the north”, which composes the devastating monstrosity, has invaded in all of the democracies. That monstrosity now has declared war to the extermination of what it calls “the plutocratic democracies”, and the capitalistic nations with liberal governments. Carrying out their wicked course of action, the composite body, “the king of the north,” has invaded all of these strongholds of education, the home, the channels of publication, the freedom of worship and assembly, and has corrupted the courts, to accomplish their wicked ambition. Can it do any good to give warning now! It appears that it cannot, so far as the government is concerned; therefore, what is here said is said that the people who love righteousness may see and appreciate the physical facts which show the clear fulfillment of the prophecy, and who, seeing and understanding, may give heed to the advice of Jesus Christ to “flee to the mountains”, that is, to The Theocratic Government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus. Jehovah’s faithful servants must in obedience to his commandment give a clear and unmistakable witness now to The Theocratic Government in order that a witness may be given to Jehovah’s name and that those people of good-will toward God may have opportunity to seek the place of safety and the way to life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” “With a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge.” This “strange god” is totalitarianism according to the Nazi, Fascist, Hierarchy type. It is with this “strange god” that the monstrosity carries on its work. In 1939 it made an operating agreement and non-aggression pact with the Communist idol god, and at Christmas time in 1940 Hitler persuaded Stalin to grant certain liberties to the Roman Catholic Jesuit operators in the lands recently brought under the Russian control, and those Catholic priests also carried on their operations in Russia to prepare the way for the invasion, which followed by the treachery of Hitler and the Papacy shortly thereafter.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> The World War was fought with the slogan ringing in the ears of the people against “the king of the north”, to wit, “This war will make the world safe for Democracy.&quot; And now this totalitarian monster, the “strange god”, the Devil’s chief instrument, leads the democracies into the Devil’s trap and causes them to howl for “more religion”, while the Devil ties them hand and foot. Such is the operation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to accomplish its purposes to unite religion, which is falsely called “Christianity”, with the state or totalitarianism. “The king of the south” yields to the seductive influence of the Hierarchy religionists, hoping that maybe the Hierarchy will ultimately join with “the king of the south&quot; in gaining world domination. Thus the blind leads the blind, and the ditch is open. The prophecy continues:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> “And increase with glory.” He does not honor Jehovah, but multiplies self-glory and glory of the Corporate State, “the abomination that maketh desolate.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>82</sup> “And he shall cause them to rule over many.” This shows a war of conquest in various fields, including activities, service, thought and worship. All of the countries that are conquered and put in subjection to “the king of the north” are put under close supervision, and a mighty bureaucracy is established, and independence and free action are denied to all the people. Subordinate officers of the totalitarian combine are put in control of all the invaded and conquered countries, and the education and the free worship and assembly and speech no longer tolerated. There is a complete regimentation of the people. Free elections are abolished, and the dictator causes his agents to “rule over many”, even as the prophecy states.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> “The king of the north” sees to it that the religious element of the monstrosity, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, bears “rule over many”. The dictator holds on to the Concordat arrangement with the Hierarchy, and that element, the Roman Catholic organization called “the church”, increases in religious power in all invaded countries. The “Catholic population” of the invaded countries are added to the domain of “the king of the north”, so that by the end of 1941 the population of the “king’s” territory is certainly to be chiefly Roman Catholic. The magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic,</span><span class="font4"> in its issue of January, 1941, page 28, says, among other things, this: “The Nazi good-will toward Catholicism is implied in dozens of apparently insignificant items that occur from day to day but are wont to escape notice. . . . Nazi officials boasted recently over the radio of ten thousand institutions in Germany conducted by the Catholic church, a number greater than that in existence previous to Hitler. The Vatican, anxious to keep up the pretense of a rift with Germany, was embarrassed by the revelation. Unable to contradict these figures, it attempted to hem and haw in reply —but the facts remain untouched and undenied.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>84</sup> “And shall divide the land for gain [for a price </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)].”</span><span class="font4"> “The king of the north” completely ignores the divine rule set forth at Psalm 24:1: “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” In passing, let it be noticed also that some who think they are supporters of The Theocracy fall into a like error by claiming the ownership of things on the earth, all of which belong to the Lord Jesus Christ, whom Jehovah God has made heir of all things. The “price” which the king requires for dividing up things according to his own will is complete and absolute obedience to the will of the Hierarchy in matters of religion, and complete obedience to the State, that is, to the Duee and the Fuehrer. It is the Jesuit system put into complete operation, that wicked system that was used prior to 1648. The payment of the “king’s” demanded “price” results in gain to the totalitarian powers; and when the price is not paid many people are put to death. Thus the Roman Catholic Hierarchy blesses the instruments of war of the “king” and has fully approved the most wicked war ever carried on, and therefore becomes party to the crime grossly violating the everlasting covenant of Almighty God concerning the sanctity of life. (Gen. 9:5,6) The German bishops of the Papacy at their Fulda Conference in 1940 voted their pledge to Hitler; and the cardinal of Vienna concluded his letter of congratulation with the words, “Heil, Hitler.” For this praise the “king” gives the clergy element lands’, or a determining control over the living conditions of the people, to be ruled by them in totalitarian fashion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">** The payment of the “price&quot; also includes what the Papacy has paid from its vast wealth held at Vatican City, concerning which wealth the books of account have never been opened or published, even to the many faithful Catholics who have paid their hard-earned money into the coffers of the Papacy. The Hierarchy induces the public press to frequently ask: “Where do Jehovah’s witnesses get their money! and how much did they receive last year?” Such is done, of course, to divert the minds of the people away from the great collections of the Hierarchy and to keep them from thinking about the fabulous sums held in the vaults of the Vatican. It is well known that the Vatican has financed the dictators of Europe and therefore had much to do with putting in power Hitler, Mussolini and Franco and keeping them in operation as the active instruments of the head of the Vatican to carry out its long-cherished ambition for world domination. The Vatican hopes to there ride on the back of those, all of whom make up the combined “beast”. At the same time the Hierarchy, operating through Vatican City, uses large sums of money to suppress the publication of God’s message of and concerning The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The same religious element subtly undermines the foundations of democracies in its effort to set up the re-establishment of the “old Holy Roman Empire”. By this practice of “price”-taking and paying, the totalitarian combine, “the abomination that maketh desolate,” is kept occupying the place where it ought not to stand. Jehovah caused Daniel to write down the prophecy foretelling exactly what the Hierarchy, together with the other elements of “the king of the north”, are now doing, and this is published for the people who are wise, that is to say, those who desire to know God’s will and who seek meekness and righteousness. —Zeph. 2: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The physical facts now clearly to be seen by all who wish to know the truth and to follow righteousness, beyond all doubt show that the political, commercial and religious elements composing “the king of the north’’ are by the course of action taken plainly saying: “There is no God&quot;; and God’s decree concerning all such is that Tie is a fool’. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.”—Ps. 53:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Let all honest and sincere people take notice now of the authoritative Word of Almighty God of and concerning the total depravity of “the king of the north”. That totalitarian monster now arrogantly and blasphemously stands where it ought not to stand, and, in defiance of Almighty God, says: “We will rule the earth or ruin it.&quot; The present is the time to which Jesus Christ refers when, in recounting the events coming to pass at the end of the world, he said: “But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains.&quot; (Mark 13:14) Thus the Lord Jesus shows that the prophecy uttered by Daniel at Jehovah’s dictation is now being fulfilled, and hence his admonition is that those in Judea should flee, if they desire to live. Who are ‘those of Judea’? All persons of good-will toward God and Christ Jesus who sincerely desire to know and to serve Jehovah and his King. The word “Judea&quot; means </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">praise,</span><span class="font4"> and therefore embraces all people who give praise to Jehovah, and not to earthly creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’’ What are the “mountains” to which Jesus admonishes sincere ones to flee and find refuge? The word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mountain</span><span class="font4"> used symbolically in the Scriptures means </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">government</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kingdom;</span><span class="font4"> and in the text uttered by Christ Jesus the holy “mountains” there mean The Theocracy, that is to say, the Government of Jehovah by Christ Jesus, his duly appointed and anointed King. Only those will survive Armageddon and live who flee to The Theocracy; because the Lord says: ‘This is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.’ —John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Why does </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> publish these things now? Not for the purpose of holding up to ridicule any creature or organization; not for the purpose of inflicting punishment upon those who compose “the king of the north”, because all punishment will be inflicted by the Lord; not for the purpose of converting those who are of “the king of the north”, because that is impossible. The purpose of the publication of these truths is to aid all persons of good-will toward God and Christ to learn of and find the only way to life everlasting. Those who do find life everlasting will forever praise Jehovah and Chbist His King!</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font4">HERE are certain seasons of the year that are given over to the game of football. Teams are trained to engage in the contest. Many contest for the supremacy. Each team has a coach who gives directions as to what should be done. Each player is expected to follow the rules carefully and each one anxiously watches his own part that he may work in exact harmony with his comrades. When the day to engage in the contest approaches each participant is carefully preparing himself to perform his part; and each one has and manifests a burning and sincere desire that his side might win. Uppermost in the mind of each one is the slogan: We must win!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If it is found that there is one in a team who looks back or who refuses to work in harmony or provokes discord, he is retired. The purpose is to have each one recognize that working in exact harmony is absolutely essential to success. They go upon the field of contest, everyone eagerly watching his part and zealously performing it. The command is given and they move on as one man. They know that controversy amongst themselves will spell disaster. They are at peace with one another and maintain that condition until the contest is finished. They do not stop to argue the proposition as to who is in command. They recognize that somebody must be; theirs is to obey orders and to work in exact harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paul the apostle, at 2 Timothy 2: 5, uses the Olympian games of contest to illustrate the Christian’s course. It is permissible that Christians at this time use modern games of contest to illustrate the course that the Christian should take or does take. Sometimes, as stated at Luke 16: 8, “the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.” It is possible to draw an example even from one in the world. Hence a comparison may be profitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Manifestly the apostle Paul, when he wrote the words of Ephesians 6:10-18, had in mind the great controversy between the forces of darkness and the forces of light at and near the final end of “the time of the end” of demon rule. While it may be true that those Scripture verses have had some application throughout the centuries since Christ, they come with greater force at “the time of the end”. The application thereof could not have been so keenly appreciated by Christians until the Lord Jesus came to the temple of God in A.D. 1918. When the proper setting of these words is gotten, their importance at this time is more keenly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Ephesians 6:10 the apostle says: “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.” The word “finally” locates the time as at or near the time of the final battle of the Devil or “Dragon” against the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses. The apostle does not say that the Christian is to be strong in himself, but that his strength is in the Lord; and here the Christian should remember that “the joy of the Lord is your strength”. (Neh. 8: 10) One who indulges in vituperative controversy with his Christian brother cannot be very much in the “joy of the Lord”. If your brother is wrong let him alone, but do not fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle warns the Christians to prepare for the final conflict and advises us with whom the battle is to be fought. At Ephesians 6:11 he says: “Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” This implies a tremendous conflict with the Devil and demonism and that the armor of the Lord is essential to the conflict of the Christian. For a time some were induced to believe that the Devil was already bound, and there was a general belief that all the demons were imprisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle then shows that there is a great host of devils working together with Satan, the chief devil. It is quite manifest that this company of devils, or demons, have been with Satan in heaven all the centuries past, participating in and forming a part of his organization invisible to man; and that since the “war in heaven” beginning in A.D. 1914 they have been cast out and down to the earth. (Rev. 12: 3-12) At Ephesians 6:12 the apostle adds: “Because our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against the principalities, against the authorities, against the worldholders of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenlies.” (Rotherham’s translation) Here the apostle Paul is giving us a view of the Devil’s organization, and in The Revelation, recorded by the apostle John, a clearer view of it is given. In Revelation twelfth chapter one of the wonders mentioned as appearing in heaven is God’s organization, Zion, giving birth to the new nation, to wit, the Kingdom, or The Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus that shall rule the heavens and the earth The other wonder there mentioned is the Devil’s organization, which attempts to run ahead of the Lord and to set up a kingdom in the place and stead of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, and then like a dragon attempts to devour the Lord’s kingdom when the time comes for it to function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the birth of The Nation or Theocratic Kingdom in A.D. 1914 a controversy in heaven followed, resulting in the Devil and his angels being cast to earth. Then comes the warning: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Rev. 12:12) Then it is plainly stated that “when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman [Zion, God’s organization] which brought forth the man child [the Kingdom or Theocratic Government]. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed [Jehovah’s witnesses], which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ”. (Rev. 12:13,17) Now it is seen that Satan and his demons are making a concerted, organized movement against the people of Jehovah God particularly, those who keep his commandments and have the testimony of and concerning the King of The Theocracy, Christ Jesus. If those engaged in a worldly contest see the necessity of standing together, with stronger reasoning should the little handful of Jehovah’s people, the remnant and their companions, now see the necessity of standing shoulder to shoulder battling for the cause of the Government of Righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Ephesians 6:13 the apostle proceeds to specifically set forth how the members of the anointed remnant and their companions must be armed and equipped for the war and how they must stand together against the wiles of the Devil: “Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.” What is here meant by “having done all”? Since A.D. 1922 the Lord has clearly revealed to his people that their fight is not against the weaknesses of the flesh, nor against flesh-and-blood creatures, but that their fight is against Satan and the host of wicked ones, invisible to human eyes, that have overreached men and'used men to set up and operate religious institutions, by and through which they have made war against God’s covenant people. His faithful ones have learned that, in order to withstand the enemy, they cannot rely upon their own ability, but that each one must be fully equipped with the armor of the Lord and rely upon Him. The covenant people of God have learned that the time is here for a complete showdown with the Devil’s crowd and that therefore this is “the evil day”. The time arrived, therefore, for specific instruction as to what course the anointed should take. No time now to ask yourself, What will the people think about me if I go out in the service as a witness for Jehovah? No reason now to say, Shall I be able to demonstrate that I have “developed a beautiful character” and can always be sweet under all conditions? What creatures think of the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses is not material. How God regards them is of all-importance. Mark well the equipment which the Lord has provided and which he instructs them to now put on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each one now must be provided with the accouterments of war. At Ephesians 6:14 the apostle continues: “Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness.” To be girt about the waist is a symbol of servitude, therefore meaning that from this time forward no one can stand against the wiles of the enemy unless he employs the faculties with which he is endowed for service in the Lord’s cause as opportunity affords. The breastplate of the warrior fits over the vital organs, particularly the heart, suggesting that the Christian must have a pure heart and must demonstrate that his heart motive is wholly, entirely and without compromise for Jehovah and his kingdom and that he is pursuing a singleness of purpose to serve God and his kingdom. Also he must be unselfish, equally as interested in his brother’s winning the warfare as he is to win.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.” The feet are shod because the presumption is that each one is moving in action. His feet must not be shod with something that will produce irritation and controversy within the ranks of the Lord’s family, but shod with the message of good tidings of “peace to men of good-will”. Where there is love amongst the brethren, of necessity there must be peace; and where there is the opposite of peace, namely, strife and controversy, selfishness predominates. The feet must be fully equipped to enter upon and go over roads rough and rocky, and made so by the enemy, and at all times and under all circumstances of adversity proclaim the good news of peace to those of good-will toward God The fight is not against your fellow creatures. You are not fighting against some earthly institution or men of earth, but contending at all times for the kingdom under Christ, and your only hope is in God and in Christ, and you are warring against the enemies of God and the enemies of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.” (Eph. 6:16) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Faith</span><span class="font4"> means to know the Word of God and to confidently rely upon it; and unless we rely upon the Word of the Lord and trust him implicitly we shall go the wrong way. If we trust him and acknowledge him in all our ways he will guide us in the way that we should go. (Prov. 3 ■ 5, 6) “Thou wilt keep him in peace, peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee.” (Isa. 26: 3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin) </span><span class="font4">If one maintains an abiding confidence in the Lord then the darts of the wicked one will strike his shield and fall harmless at his feet. One who is in the joy of the Lord and singing his praises and is at peace must have faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.” (Eph. 6:17) The helmet fitted over the head, and therefore is a symbol of intellectual appreciation of the truth as it is revealed, and also an intellectual appreciation of the proper relationship between the creature and Jehovah God and his kingdom, with reliance upon God’s Word, knowing that salvation belongeth to Jehovah and that there is no other means of salvation and victory. The truth is the Lord’s, and he will give it to his people in his own good time and in his own good way. The Christian must keep his mind alert and see to it that he does not become a dreamer, but that his vision is clear; and this will enable his heart to rejoice. Then having the Word of God, the sword of the spirit, and wielding it according to God’s will he has both an offensive and a defensive weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That “sword of the spirit” with which Jehovah’s witnesses are armed, by the grace of the Lord, is the message from Almighty God through Christ Jesus of and concerning The Theocratic Government. The oppressed people must learn that the “Higher Powers” are Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and that religion is of Satan, which he uses to entrap and enslave the people and turn them away from God. That instrument of warfare punctures and cuts in all directions. The message of the truth penetrates the very vitals of the religious organizations and their leaders, who hold to and teach traditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the Christian is fully equipped to enter upon the field of contest. Now suppose everyone enters into a controversy with everyone else. How long would the company of God’s covenant people stand before the adversary? He would get them all. If each one has keenly at heart the interests of every other one he will watch for the interest of that one; and while he is watching he will have an anxious, burning desire that his brother, as well as himself, might win in this fight. If he loves him he can take no other course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle under inspiration emphasizes now the importance of standing shoulder to shoulder in the controversy. At Ephesians 6:18 he says: “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Supplication</span><span class="font4"> means to entreat, to seek earnestly, to beseech It means to humbly implore and petition with great solicitude. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Perseverance</span><span class="font4"> means to continue, to persist in the prosecution of any enterprise begun. It means steadfastness, constancy, persistency in prosecuting the work at hand. It means to continue regardless of opposition or discouragement, never giving over and never abandoning what is undertaken. This is what the apostle says each one must do for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">each other one of the Lord’s little ones. This prayer and supplication must be in the spirit of the Lord, which is love, unselfishly looking after the interests of one’s brother; and while praying one is commanded to be “watching thereunto with all perseverance”. Be it noted that this prayer and watchfulness is not merely one for one other, but it is each one for all the saints. Otherwise stated, each one in the company of the Lord recognizes every other one in that company as a servant of the Lord and that the interests of all are mutual, and that all must stand together. It is manifest that if brethren are following this instruction of the apostle not only are they dwelling in peace but they will be avoiding everything that tends to controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who engage in controversy amongst themselves could hardly be worthy of the name “Christian”. “Christians” means those who follow the anointed One, the “Prince of Peace”. The apostle stresses the matter of “fighting shoulder to shoulder”. (Phil. 1:27,28, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font4"> Nowhere in the Scriptures are Christians warranted in fighting one another. When Nehemiah was building the wall around Jerusalem he said to the men under his command: “Fight for your brethren.” (Neh. 4:14) He there pictured the people of God inside of the organization of Zion at the time of the final assault by the enemy. Let each one, then, who is of Jehovah’s organization or under it for safety remember his duty and obligation to fight, not against his brother, but for his brother and against demonism. The fearlessness of the Lord’s people in the proclamation of the message of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and their doing this in harmony, will be to each one a token of salvation, as stated at Philippians 1: 28. It will bring joy to the heart; and “the joy of the Lord is your strength”, said Nehemiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enemy is not limited to one method of making war against the remnant and their companions. He will employ many methods. One method is to stir up strife among the brethren, plant in the hearts of some the root of bitterness, nourish and cause it to grow until such take themselves out from under the protection of the Lord. Let no one be deceived into believing that merely because he is under the Lord’s righteous arrangement he is beyond all danger. All danger will be past when he has maintained his integrity unto the end. It is true that he is absolutely safe as long as he abides close to the Lord; but the permission of selfishness, leading to controversy, will take him away from the Lord and his protection. This opens the door for the adversary to get in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore, in following the admonition of the apostle, the Christian must earnestly and with supplication present his petition to Jehovah God, asking for unity amongst the brethren, for strength, for peace; and while doing this he must watch with perseverance, refusing to give over to the enemy under any circumstances.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MODERN VISITS OF JEHOVAH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">A</span><span class="font4">MAN is struck by lightning and dies. The coroner and jury hear the facts and render a verdict that the man died by reason of a “visitation from God”. A corporation which is a common carrier undertakes to transport personal property, and in so doing is legally liable for any negligence in transportation or delivery. If in course of transportation the property is destroyed by a storm and the carrier corporation is sued, the defense is made by the corporation that it is not liable because the destruction was the result of an act or “visitation” of God. A great property loss and loss of lives have recently been caused by the flooding of the Mississippi river. This has been charged up to Jehovah God, but as a matter of fact it resulted from the disturbed elements. There is no Scriptural reason to believe that Jehovah directed the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Sacred Record shows that at stated times Jehovah has visited his covenant people and also his enemies, and that he will visit them. He visits his people for the purposes of inspection, chastisements, deliverance and blessing. He visits his enemies for the purpose of chastisement and destruction. Those whom God visits are brought into a condition of greater responsibility by reason of his visit. This responsibility is in proportion to the knowledge possessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Long ago Joseph, the favorite son of Jacob, was sold by his envious half-brothers into Egypt. There he faithfully served Jehovah God as a true witness. Ere he died he had seen his aged father and his brethren brought into that land, and he had cared for them. He had witnessed the death of his father. For many years thereafter Joseph ministered to and comforted his brethren. The time of his departure into the land of death came, and Joseph said by faith: “I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” (Gen. 50: 24) That was a prophecy uttered by Joseph, foretelling that God would visit his people, the Israelites, in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later an evil ruler of Egypt greatly oppressed the Israelites. God called Moses to go unto that people and bear them a message: “Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt.” (Ex. 3:16, 17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> That was a visitation of inspection. God had heard the cries of the oppressed and visited his people for inspection ; and now he would visit them and deliver them, and he would use Moses in so doing. When the Israelites were hard pressed by their enemies God put his hand over them and delivered them into safety. This was a visitation of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Jehovah established Israel in the Land of Promise. In due time he placed his faithful witness David upon the throne. He made a covenant with David, which covenant concerning the Kingdom he made known unto him through Nathan the prophet. (2 Samuel 7th chapter) Concerning that covenant God caused one of his prophets in Israel to write: “My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.”—Ps. 89: 28-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites did forsake that covenant and failed to walk in the way of righteousness. In due time God visited them and administered to them a terrible chastisement. The iniquities and transgressions of that people became so flagrant that God visited them and entered his decree against them and enforced that decree by permitting the Israelites, and especially their unfaithful king, to be captured and carried away to Babylon.—Ezek. 21:24-27; Jer. 52:1-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never again did Israel have a king. Affliction had been for a long time upon Israel when the time came for the birth of John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus, the Savior of believing humankind. Then it was that John’s father, Zacharias, prophesied and said: “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people.” (Luke 1:68) That was a visit of blessing from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then came Jesus of Nazareth, the One anointed of God to be King in The Theocratic Government. Of and concerning him the prophets had written. The devout ones of Israel had looked for his coming. Jesus was preaching concerning the kingdom of heaven. On an occasion he was at Capernaum. A widow had lost her only son to the enemy death. As they carried the dead man out, Jesus saw him and observed his mother weeping. He had compassion upon her and raised the young man out of death. Luke 7:16 records: “And there came a fear on all; and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The holy prophets had written concerning the coming of the Messiah, or Anointed One, who was foreshadowed by the prophat Moses. Jehovah had provided at the hand of Moses the law covenant with Israel and had decreed that the law covenant should be a “schoolmaster” to lead the Israelites in the right way unto the coming of the Messiah. This favor brought responsibility upon the Jews. The nation failed to keep the law covenant, and many turned away therefrom to religion. Then came John the Baptist, warning the Jews to repent and be baptized and return unto harmony with God. The responsibility of the Jews increased when they heard this warning. John was the forerunner of the Messiah; and when Jesus began his ministry John pointed him out and said to those within his hearing: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.”—John 1:29-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was a visitation from Jehovah God for good unto Israel. Many of the common people heard him gladly, and doubtless the entire nation would have turned to him and accepted him as the Messiah except for the wrongful influence of the religious clergy of that time. The clergy were familiar with the text of the Scriptures concerning the coming of the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They were properly informed that Jesus was the Messiah. He told them that he was sent from Jehovah. Their knowledge brought upon them greater responsibility, and also responsibility rested upon all the people in proportion to the knowledge that they had received concerning Jesus as God’s Anointed One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because the people were misled by the religious clergy they did not appreciate the time of their visitation. Jesus had come to them to bring them blessing and happiness, but their leaders in religion would not have it so. Only a few of the Israelites accepted Jesus, and to them he gave the power to become the sons of God, as declared at John 1:12,13. For three and one-half years he taught the people. Then he rode on an ass into Jerusalem and offered himself to them as their King. He was rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus wept because the people did not appreciate the favor that had come to them by the visit of God by means of his visible representative. “And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.” (Luke 19:41-44) On that occasion Jesus prophesied the visitation of God upon Jerusalem and its complete destruction. Only a few years elapsed until that prophecy was fulfilled, to wit, in A.D. 70. God by his chosen executioner laid the city in waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For three and one-half years after the violent death of Christ Jesus the opportunity to become members of God’s royal family of heaven was confined to the Jews after the flesh. By their own efforts the non-Jews or Gentiles never could have come to God and found him and been partakers of the great salvation to life in the spirit in heaven But few Jews appreciated God’s visit to them, and now he would turn his hand to the Gentiles. In the exercise of his loving-kindness God made himself known unto the Gentiles and made it possible for Gentiles to be partakers of the great salvation through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This incident is beautifully described in the Scriptures, in chapter ten of the Acts of the Apostles. There was a little band of Italians (Romans) at Caesarea, on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea. A Gentile by the name of Cornelius was captain of that band, or company of soldiers Of course, the military of Rome was a part of Satan’s organization. Cornelius, although an officer of that military, was a devout man. He feared God and prayed often to Jehovah. He was not harsh, but kind and generous, and gave much to aid the poor. He did not use his office for oppressive purposes, but did good in spite of his official position. He was doubtless a kind and sympathetic man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cornelius did not know Jehovah God, because the way for a Gentile to come to God had not been opened. He did not understand God’s purpose as to his Theocratic Government and the redemption and salvation of believing men, but he believed in the existence of God and that God had a way whereby he would bless him and others who loved righteousness; and therefore he prayed. While he thus prayed God sent to him an angel. Cornelius was afraid when he beheld an angel, and cried out: “What is it, Lord?” The angel said: “Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That was a visit from God to a Gentile. At the direction of God’s messenger Cornelius sent to Joppa, farther down the coast, for the apostle Peter. At the same time God gave Peter a vision directing him to go to Cornelius. When the two had met, Peter said: “Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.” (Acts 10:34) Peter then recounted to Cornelius God’s great purpose concerning his Kingdom and the redemption of humankind through the blood of Christ Jesus. This visit of God to Cornelius brought him a wonderful blessing. He heeded the message and was then and there anointed by the spirit of Jehovah, and thus commissioned as a witness for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Peter went up to Jerusalem and related the circumstances of God’s visit to Cornelius. There were amongst the Jews those who opposed the act of Peter in going to a Gentile. But when they had heard the circumstances of Peter’s going to Cornelius the Jews said: “Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.” On a later occasion, when some Christians were gathered together and some were teaching that only circumcised persons could be saved and there was much talk between them, two witnesses. Barnabas and Paul, told what God had done by them amongst the Gentiles. Then the apostle James, gaining the attention of the audience, said: “Simeon [Peter] hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.”—Acts 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From that time forward the Gentiles were brought nigh unto God and within his favor, by reason of God’s visit to them. Thereafter God made no distinction between Jews and Gentiles, bond or free; but all who came to him, confessing Christ Jesus and consecrating themselves to do God’s will as Jesus does it, were received regardless of nationality. The good effect of that visit to the Gentiles must continue “until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in”. (Rom. 11:25) That time marks the completion of the class anointed with God’s spirit for the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The period of time elapsing from the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ on earth until the completion of the number of his anointed followers, or “body of Christ”, is the antitypical “day of atonement”, foreshadowed by the Jewish day of atonement. (See Leviticus chapter sixteen.) In that period of time very few Jews have accepted Christ as the Savior, or even pretended so to do. From among the Gentiles there has come a vast multitude professing the name of Christ with their lips. Organized systems of religion have arisen which call themselves by the name of Christ, and with their mouths they profess to be followers of God’s Anointed One. Consider the facts now: Who are the ones in the earth that ill-treat, persecute and cause to be arrested and imprisoned the faithful witnesses of Jehovah God, who go about from house to house visiting and revisiting the people to exhibit to them “this gospel of the kingdom” and to tell them about that Theocratic Government? There is but one answer. It is the religionists, the leaders in the religious organizations, that cruelly persecute the faithful followers of Christ, and the ones that take the lead in that cruel persecution are those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy ruled from Vatican City. They are the ones who urge the people to destroy the books which explain the Kingdom or Kingdom message. It is those religionists, who are children and agents of the Devil and therefore enemies of the Lord, that are desperately trying to keep the people in ignorance of what is written in the Bible. The day of accounting must come, in which every one of the religious systems must give an account for their course of action, and this in proportion to their knowledge. Also each Christian individually must give an account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When will that time of accounting take place? The direct evidence of the Bible and the circumstantial evidence in the events of modern times prove that in A.D. 1914 Christ Jesus, at the right hand of Jehovah God, took his power and began his reign, and in 1918 he eame to the spiritual temple of God, as foretold at Malachi 3:1-3 and as further foreshadowed by Jesus’ visit to the temple at Jerusalem and casting the money-changers and commercialists therefrom. There God began to visit those who professed to be his people. Since 1 Corinthians 8:6 states that all things are from the Father and all things are by the Son, these visits may be spoken of as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God’s</span><span class="font4"> visitation, even though Jesus is His active agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visit of Jehovah God when Christ Jesus came to his temple is for the purpose of inspection, judgment and blessing. About A.D. 1918, in the throes of the first World War, there came upon Jehovah’s people many very trying circumstances. The experiences following were exceeding sore. As it was in the days of the rebuilding of the walls of the city of Jerusalem by the governor Nehemiah and his brethren in the face of violent opposition by religious enemies, when Nehemiah’s prayer was made, “Remember me, 0 Lord, for good,” even so the Lord’s faithful servants on earth during the time of stress in 1918 prayed. The prophet of God had written of and concerning Jehovah’s people this prayer: “Remember me, 0 Lord, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: 0 visit me with thy salvation.” (Ps. 106:4) The prophet Jeremiah foreshadowed Jehovah’s witnesses of today, and he uttered a prayer which applies in behalf of these present-day witnesses from and after 1918: “0 Lord, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.”—Jer. 15:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God visited his people at that time, and the approved ones he made his commissioned witnesses to his name and his Theocratic Government. They entered into the joy of the Lord and realized that the joy of the Lord is their strength, as stated at Nehemiah 8:10. The period of inspection and blessing of the temple class continued, and will continue until all have been made meet for a part in The Theocratic Government. This judgment, which there began at the house of God, was next to extend to those who named the name of the Lord not in truth and sincerity. —1 Pet. 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visits of Jehovah do not mean that he must leave his throne in heaven and come to earth, but they do mean the exercise of his power toward things of earth and the exercise of it through his duly constituted agency. That the period of God’s visitation began with the coming of the Lord to his temple for judgment of the house of God and then of the nations, separating them as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats, is further shown by Isaiah’s prophecy, chapter six, concerning his vision of the Lord’s presence at the temple. Isaiah, as a witness of Jehovah, pictures the anointed witnesses of Jehovah of today. Jehovah there showed through his prophet that the anointed class are entirely devoted to him and that their heart’s desire is expressed in the words voiced by the prophet: “Here am I; send me.” When the prophet asked of the Lord how long this strenuous witness must be given, the answer was: “Until the cities [organized systems, particularly ‘Christendom’] be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed men [the religionists] far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.” (Isa. 6:11,12) God’s visitation upon the nations will reach a climax in the great time of trouble, Armageddon, now near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the time of the prophet Jeremiah there were false priests and religious teachers who misrepresented God and misled the people. The words of the prophet directed to them find an ever stronger application to the false pastors and religious teachers of the present time, to wit: “As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked; they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper: and the right of the needy do they not judge. Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this [‘Christendom’] ? A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my [professed] people love to have it so; and what will ye do in the end thereof ?”-Jer. 5:27-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is a forceful description of the unrighteous systems that parade under the name of Christ. That the great day of God’s visitation upon the nations, including “organized Christianity”, so called, is just ahead is clearly marked out by the words of the prophet, and it will be a time of trouble such as was never before known. (See Jeremiah 5:9-29; 6:15; 9:9; 23:2,20-22.) The leaders in these religious systems have prospered, grown fat and sleek, are proud and haughty; and God will visit them for the purpose of bringing their haughtiness low. Babylon, Satan’s organization, shall fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Jeremiah 50:31,32 it is written: “Behold, I am against thee, 0 thou most proud, saith the Lord God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.” The Lord God through his prophet further describes these unholy systems and expresses his determination to visit them: “Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind. Every man is brutish by his knowledge : every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.”—Jer. 51:1,17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now the Lord God Jehovah has made it clear what is the primary issue, world domination. Who is for Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and who is not ? Before the final overthrow of the systems, during the time of God’s visitation at Armageddon, he will have a witness given in the earth concerning his purposes, and it still continues. To his anointed and commissioned ones on earth he has said: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, that I am God.” That means, then, that every one who is anointed by Jehovah’s spirit is commissioned to perform this duty; and this he must do in proportion to his opportunities, in order to be acceptable and blessed of the Lord And to the people of good-will toward God who now hear the message of and concerning The Theocratic Government he says: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” Come where? Come and take your stand firmly on the side of The Theocratic Government, if you would live!—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the anointed witnesses it is written (1 Peter 2:12): “Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.” Having in mind that the day of God’s visitation upon “Christendom” began shortly after 1918 and reaches its climax at the battle of Armageddon, thus continuing with increased severity until all the worldly systems are overthrown, who, then, shall glorify God in this day of his visitation? Not every one, of course. The Scriptures indicate that there will be a “great multitude”, however, who will glorify him. (See Revelation 7: 9-15 ) In the denominational religious systems are many “prisoners” held in restraint by the clergy. The zealous anointed remnant and their companions, in obedience to Jehovah’s command, at Isaiah 42:7 and 49: 9, are bidding these prisoners to show themselves and to go forth. Many of these are hearing the message and are increasing in courage. Many return visits are being made on those displaying good-will. Many of these have in times past spoken evil against Jehovah’s witnesses. These zealous ones will continue to pursue a course of honesty as God’s witnesses, and multitudes of persons of good-will toward Jehovah and his Theocratic Government will glorify God in this day of his visitation because the faithful witness has been given by his devoted ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The commandment that is paramount at this time is to be a faithful witness to Jehovah God and His King Christ Jesus and to proclaim the message of his kingdom as a witness to the nations before God’s great visitation upon them. (Isa. 43:10; Matt. 24:14) Will anyone who is consecrated and devoted to the Lord be willing to remain idle and inactive in the Lord’s service and take his chances of being finally approved? God has provided the means to give the witness now and to give it in no uncertain terms, and this is just before his great visitation to the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who receive the Lord’s approval will be the ones who not only are willing but are anxious to tell the peoples of earth that Jehovah is God, that Christ Jesus is King, that God has set his King upon the throne, and that the kingdom of heaven, The Theocratic Government, is at hand. The zeal of such will result to the glory of God, when the institutions of Satan are crumbling in the dust and the obedient people are delivered. The Christian’s chief duty is to glorify Jehovah.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>FIELD EXPERIENCES</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS DOG COULD BARK (SCOTLAND)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Two years ago Christians were shocked at the rough handling of Jehovah’s witnesses by Catholic mobs in a well-known Clydeside area. A number of assaults were carried out at the instigation of the priests, but despite these assaults Jehovah’s servants persisted in their God-given commission to visit this area to issue warning to the opposers of Jehovah’s judgments and also to comfort the people of good-will, and in the course of one year made five visits, all of which resulted in severe persecution. During the recent savage air raids made by the Nazis on the Clydeside area which stretches for several miles, this particular place suffered the heaviest, and the streets where the severe persecutions took place received the worst of the blitz. Just recently the publishers again visited this section, and one publisher making his way through the debris of destruction realized the tenements were uninhabitable. Coming away from one tenement after investigation the publisher decided there was no one about, but, once out in the street, he heard the barking of a dog and, looking up, saw a lady’s face at the window. To the publisher it looked like the last outpost of civilization. He at once went to the lady’s door, who, by this time, was joined by her husband. They both listened to the lecture ‘Message of Hope’ and took the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> and a back-call was arranged. Thirty publishers that morning placed more than sixty books in this area, and a few hundred booklets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KINDRED-MINDED COPPERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Portage, Pennsylvania: “As I was witnessing on Fifth street a lady called an officer and told him I was making trouble for the neighborhood. The officer said: ‘I’ll see!’ Then he walked along the sidewalk and waited till I played my phonograph in fifteen or twenty homes. (He listened each time.) When I finished working that street I asked if he would like to hear the record personally. He only smiled and said he wanted to ‘buy’ a green book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[Religion]. </span><span class="font4">He gave me 50c and told me to keep the change ‘for courage’. I then also offered him the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font4"> At first he refused it, saying he liked green better. I told him red is as njce as green, so he smiled and said: ‘Oh, I’ll take them both.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Glasgow, Scotland: “A street corner—four pioneers, complete with magazine bags, met to work the territory. Two policemen came in sight and as they drew alongside one stopped his companion and read: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'The &quot;Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> explains the Theocratic Government, 3d. per copy.’ ‘I’ll have threepence worth,’ he said. Having no magazines to offer, one pioneer said: ‘Here are three booklets which show the establishment of God’s kingdom.’ The policeman replied that he had the booklets, and so was advised by the pioneer to take </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span><span class="font4"> The man in blue smiled, handing over his shilling, and away he went, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> in his hand, telling his companion what a bargain he had got.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO WERE DESECRATORS OF THE FLAGT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“My two brothers and I, pioneering in northeastern Missouri, started street-corner witnessing in a small town called Gorin. There was one other publisher from the local company. I took the corner in front of the postoffice, my two brothers on the street crossing it. After standing a few moments I noticed a group of men talking, apparently of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">352</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">us. The people were quite rude when asked to read the magazines. Then an American Legionnaire, Bernie Haynes, approached my brother and asked: ‘Are you one of those who don’t salute the flag!’ My brother told him: ‘Yes, I am.’ Haynes went into a saloon close by and soon returned, carrying a large flag. By this time there was a group of men around my brother, men who spend their time loafing on street corners. Haynes shouted: ‘You’ll either salute or kiss this flag, or get out of town!’ Reasoning with him was impossible, so my brother said he would neither salute nor kiss it. The men were all looking for a fight by this time, and Haynes, walking in back of my brother, as if to go into the saloon again, hit him twice in the back of the head. Then the men, led by Haynes, escorted my brother to the car. Then we were called and told to get in. Resistance against such a demonized mob would have been useless, as they were threatening to overturn the car. Haynes was shouting: ‘We don’t want any of you Hitlers over here!’ The flag, loved and respected by every true American, was dropped flat in the dust by these maniacal bums. There it lay, in the dusty street, and not one of the people gathered there had the decency to pick it up. We are planning now to go back into the town, with many more witnesses, and show that God’s witnesses cannot be run out of town.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COURAGEOUS ACTION AT RUSHVILLE, IND.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This town is seventeen miles from Connersville. I worked business alone. First day I worked all day, placed two books and eight or ten booklets and was threatened several times, and one young man begged me to leave town, as he was afraid they would hurt me: ‘they hate you people here, and I can’t see why.’ I went on. Around 2:30 I called on a lawyer; I was completely exhausted then, after fighting demons all day. I answered all his questions. Then he turned and said: ‘I want nothing to do with Jehovah’s witnesses.’ By this time I felt, Well, I’m not coming back here tomorrow; this town is hopeless. I really did not intend going in there the next day alone, as I was followed and watched like a hawk. But I glanced in another office next to this lawyer’s. A young man about thirty-five sat there, watching me. He smiled. I said: ‘You no doubt heard me talking, but Fil talk to you a few minutes if you aren’t too busy.’ He said: ‘Well, please sit down and explain this to me.’ It got me, after eight hours there, to find someone with just a little kindness. The Lord came to my rescue, and that was the blessing for the day. He took the set of books I had and said: ‘This is what I have wanted all my life.’ I got out of that town at 9 p.m. I went back, finished the town and made back-calls on this young man. He scouted for me the balance of the time I was there. I enclose part of a letter he wrote me: ‘To date I have only had three discussions on what </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font4"> Americanism stands for. I was in the candy shop today, and a young man who happened to be in there made the remark that he had heard there was one of Jehovah’s witnesses in town trying to educate the people to not salute the flag, and, of course, I couldn’t take that! In the best way I could I informed the young man that he had been misguided and that through knowing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah’s witnesses were really better Americans than those who were persecuting them. Before I had said three words I had an audience, for which I was glad. I was also warned at another place to be careful? ”</span></p>
