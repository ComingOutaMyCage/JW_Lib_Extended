<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">VIEW FROM THE TOWER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The interest still continues over the entire Zion.  Letters expressive of very deep interest come in daily in great numbers, and show that the people are being stirred to an examination of the Scripture as never before.  We append a few letters for your benefit.  Many of the best are too personal to admit of publication.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These expressions of gratitude to God for heavenly food and spiritual strength, received through a discernment of his plan and better understanding of His Word, are from consecrated children of God in various social stations, but not many, though some from the ministers of churches. It is strange indeed, that the ministers and people do not seize the joyful tidings and carry it with one glad shout of praise to God, o'er all the earth--wherever christians dwell.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But while they are well aware that the various sectarian creeds contradict each other, and that many parts of Scripture are not in harmony with any of them, yet they are unwilling to examine these things which God is now opening up--because it is now due time for his plan to be understood by his children--and shun them as though they were poison instead of FOOD.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R325 : page 1::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Poor things, they are afraid to read lest they should be unsettled; but the whole difficulty is, that they are already unsettled and their faith being built on the sandy foundations of human traditions instead of on the rock, they are in constant danger of the floods of skepticism and infidelity sweeping their little all, away.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Meanwhile, ministers seem to become alarmed, because the best elements in their flocks, give heed to and relish the &quot;Food&quot; now being provided the sheep by the chief Shepherd. Many of these ministers seeking &quot;honor one of another&quot; and the approbation of the worldly element of their churches, are far less prepared for this &quot;meat in due season&quot; than some--more humble--of their flocks.  Even some </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> men in the ministry feel so confident that the Great &quot;Babylon&quot; that they have builded is all right, that they, without giving the subject study, join with others in saying: &quot;Stop thinking,&quot; &quot;Don't read it,&quot; (&quot;Food for Thinking Christians,&quot;) &quot;Burn the book.&quot;  How strange--how pitiable, that men--christian men--ministers of the Word of God, should treat thus, anything based solely on the Word of God and manifesting only the spirit of Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who read and think are convinced, not by any confidence in the teachers of the &quot;TOWER,&quot; but by the Word of God; and when such meet the Doctors of Divinity, their Scriptural knowledge is more than a match for the earthly learning of the latter.  And thus &quot;a little one may chase a thousand.&quot;  See how fully `Isa. 29:9,14`, is being fulfilled in this, our day.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How much the present methods remind us of the way in which Papacy treated all Protestants and their writings.  As the priests once claimed that none should have the Bible, because only the priests could understand or expound it; so Protestants now say: yes, read the Bible but you can understand only such small parts as we can expound.  And even that small part each denomination construes differently, to the amusement of infidels and dismay of all thinking christians.  Yet so great is the reverence for CREEDS and traditions of men, that each party would prefer to see an opposing creed succeed rather than that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should step in and furnish the connecting link, which would not only harmonize the creeds with each other, but also with the Bible.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Why this opposition?  As seen from the TOWER, it appears to be because of a love of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sectarianism.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> All are sectarian who love a christian specially or more, because a member of their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">division</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the church, and whose time and interest is in the upbuilding of their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">division</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not in the cause of truth.  Such oppose our teachings because they realize that it opposes some features of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">creed.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And it is for this cause that we are hated of all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">creatures)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for Christ's sake, because our teachings are in opposition to some features of every sect.  The world also hates us, because we are still more separate from it than the nominal church.  But this is our work --&quot;To bear witness to the truth.&quot; And blessed are those who are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">beheaded</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the witness of Jesus and the Word of God, and who worship not the BEAST neither his IMAGE, but God only.</font><br />

God grant to use him much in his service and for the blessing of the household.  We may expect occasional notes from his pen in the TOWER.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Bro. Sunderlin is nearly well again. (He has been laid up for nearly five months, by reason of over-exertion, incident to the arrangements for the distribution of the &quot;Food&quot; in Great Britain and Ireland.)

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PASSOVER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, therefore, let us keep the feast.&quot; `1 Cor. 5:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">From the account of the instituting of the Lord's supper, furnished in `Matt. 26:26,28`, and `Luke 22:7-20`, and `1 Cor. 11:23-26`; we incline to the view that it was designed to be a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">yearly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> remembrancer of our Lord's death, and that it is properly observed on its anniversary.  Apparently it was instituted by Christ Jesus &quot;our Passover,&quot; &quot;The lamb of God which taketh away the sins of world,&quot; (`John 1:29`) as a substitute for the Jewish </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Passover.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For this reason we meet each year for its commemoration on the anniversary of our Lord's death.  (The 14th day of the first month--Jewish time.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We do not quarrel with any who prefer to commemorate more frequently, neither do we regard it as a binding or compulsory observance. We observe it because we rejoice thus to remember our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom price</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- &quot;the propitiation </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(satisfaction)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The time for the observance of the Lord's death this year will be after 6 P.M. of April 2d, which we believe to be the date corresponding to the time at which Jesus and his disciples ate of it; 3 o'clock P.M., the day following corresponding to the hour of Jesus death. `Matt. 27:46-50`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Accordingly, there will be a meeting at the residence of J. L. Russell, No. 80 Cedar avenue, Allegheny City, at 7:45 P.M. of Sunday April 2d, for commemorating the breaking of the body and the shedding of the blood of Christ.  Thus, &quot;as oft as we do this, (on its anniversary) we do show the Lord's death till he come&quot;--till the last member of his body being dead with him, shall be like him, glorified and perfected as a new creature.  For &quot;the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion [sharing by us] of the blood [death] of Christ?  The bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ [in his death]? For we being many are one bread [loaf] and one body.&quot; `1 Cor. 10:16`. Hence, when we eat and drink, we show not only our interest in his sacrifice, but also express our own covenant to be dead with him, and to drink of his cup.  (See, `Matt. 20:22,23`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These are always precious seasons here; and letters received from various groups of twos, threes, twenties and fifties last year, indicated that they enjoyed a similar blessing.  &quot;Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, therefore, let us keep the feast&quot;-- putting away all leaven of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">malice,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">envyings,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc., let us be of the unleavened loaf--the body of Christ --each member, not puffed up, but easily broken.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We generally use unleavened cakes (which may be purchased of any Hebrew family) and raisin juice.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PROGRESS OF INFIDELITY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is acknowledged by all unprejudiced persons capable of judging, that infidelity is on the increase. Speaking upon this subject, the Chicago </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tribune</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> says: &quot;It is idle for the people of a religious habit, and especially for those who are charged with nursing and promoting piety, to ignore the progress which infidelity has been making during the past few years.  The contrast between the crowded auditorium in which Col. Ingersol delivered his lecture recently, with the sparse attendance which awaited similar appearances a few years ago, furnishes a striking evidence of its progress.&quot;  The writer continues his theme, and very truthfully says: &quot;The progress of infidelity, as signalized by Ingersoll's success, likewise denotes the growth and spread of irreverence.  Perhaps this is the worst feature of the new order of things.  The danger of irreverence is its invasive tendency.  Beginning with its forms, it soon extends to the essence; starting with dogma, it is apt to proceed at a rapid rate to principle, society, and the family. The infidel must provide his own morality, and impose his own restraints. No man or sect is his guardian, and his code of ethics is of his own making.  The modern spirit of progress is creating sad havoc with the traditions and precedents which might continue their influence even when the inspiration of Scriptures is doubted.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a very sad fact, that at this time, when God, His Christ, and His Holy Book are so ruthlessly assailed</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R326 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">by these godless, profane infidels, that the church has very nearly lost its power to withstand the oncoming tide.  The finely written essays of her ministers are blank cartridges, when directed against such batteries.  The pomp and glitter of modern worship, with sensational story-telling for Gospel, is as powerless to resist this overwhelming infidelity, as a shadow would be to stop a cyclone.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tribune</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> further says:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;There is naturally great diversity of opinion as to the effect of the palpable growth of infidelity that marks our age.  The aggressive infidel like Ingersoll believes it to be an essential and valuable part of the world's progress.  To him it denotes the downfall of superstition and the spread of reason and enlightenment. The conservative doubter is inclined to deprecate the contagion of infidelity. He believes himself and most of those who have exchanged their doubts with him to be capable of shaping their morals in the right direction, but fears that the removal of restraints will lead the masses to excess and riot of free thought and irresponsible actions.  The churchman condemns without qualification the new departure as sacrilegious and wicked, leading to all the penalties in this life and the future which the strictest construction of the church tenants impose upon the infidel and the scoffer.  These various sentiments can find no common ground upon which to meet, and infidelity must take its course, except as it may be restrained by moral and social influences, for the day of the rack and the thumb-screw, the terror of the cross and the stake are gone forever.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It would seem to be a cruel accusation to make, to say that the church has done much to produce this fearful increase of infidelity, but so it appears from what infidels and all unprejudiced writers say.  Not that the church had intended any such thing, but many of her dogmas, such as unconditional election, man's inherent immortality, endless torture as punishment for sin, the endlessness of evil and rebellion against God, appear so unreasonable and arbitrary, and present the character of a just and merciful Creator and Ruler in a contradictory light, that these infidels, assuming that the teaching of the church is in harmony with the Bible, have, without critically testing these dogmas by the Scriptures, rejected the Church, the Bible, and its Author. If this be true, then the only antidote for this infidel poison is the presentation and adoption of the true Bible theology, by which God and His revelations shall be presented in their true character.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Brethren, the present period, with all the wonderful circumstances crowded into it, offers the most glorious opportunity to the loyal servants of Christ to defend Deity, Jesus Christ, and the holy Scriptures, that was ever offered to any generation of God's servants since the world began.  The present hours are truly filled with grand opportunities, sublime duties, such as angels and prophets were amazed to see in vision, and such as holy men have desired to enjoy, but died without enjoying the grand privilege.  May the God of all grace give us wisdom not to waste these golden opportunities in children's play, striving about personal, carnal things, catching motes, while golden crowns are within reach.--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Selected.</font></b><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHAT IS MEAT?</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Who then, is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.&quot; `Matt. 24:45,46`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand these words to have been spoken to the disciples originally, but were for the instruction of the church throughout the Gospel age, but especially at its close.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As some of the times and events spoken of by our Lord have come and gone, and as Christians have marked these passing events with careful anxiety, because they gave corresponding indication of the ending of trial and trouble to the children of God, many of them, for some reason, seem to have come to think that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exact</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> knowledge of the time of our Lord's coming was the most essential thing to attend to.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Far be it from us, in this connection to throw cold water upon the expectations of any who are watching for the revelation of the world's coming King; and far be it from us to join in the cry of objection so often urged: &quot;O, we don't know </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anything</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> about it; Jesus said, 'no man knoweth the day nor the hour;' I don't think we ought to pry into such things,&quot; etc.  But, while we would do neither of these, let us carefully consider the words of our Saviour in the `text quoted`.  In the `preceding verse` he says, &quot;In such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot; Notice he is not speaking to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> now, but to the disciples, and doubtless to all those who should afterward &quot;believe on him through their word.&quot;  As much as to say, I have now answered your questions regarding these important events; you and the succeeding members of the body of Christ, the little flock, can mark by the fulfillment of these signs at different points in this good-news age, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">something near</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the time of my coming and presence.  (They had been asking </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">when</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> there should not be &quot;one stone left upon another&quot; of these magnificent buildings, and what should be the sign of his presence, and of the end of the age.)  See `vss. 2,3`. Though they were not to be overtaken as a thief (the world would be), nor to be in darkness regarding it (`1 Thes. 5:4`), yet they were not to know the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hour, i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exact</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time of his coming, yet if they were to watch </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">closely</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they would not mistake the signs of his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> viz., that it would be with the world as it was in</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R327 : page 3::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the days of Noah, careless and thoughtless, the whole attention given to fleshly desires, not understanding nor caring for the spiritual; `verses 37,38,39`, and saying </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;where</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">promise</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his coming.&quot; `2 Peter 3:4`. But a very </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">striking</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sign of his presence would be that the evil servant would be smiting his fellow servants and saying, &quot;My Lord </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">delayeth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his coming&quot; (presence).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The nominal church is now doing this, and it is cause for regret that it is not confined to it.  But, while he charged them to watch that they might not be like Jerusalem, ignorant of the time of their visitation, and as a consequence unprepared, he follows it up with a question which embodies an exhortation to a still </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more important</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> duty, which, while being done, should </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not leave the other undone,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> viz., &quot;Who is a wise and faithful servant&quot; ...giving &quot;meat in due season&quot; to the household?  What household?  The household of faith.  Then it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> things he is speaking of, similar to those spoken of in the `sixth chapter of John`, 53d to 63d verse inclusive. Please read those words, &quot;they are spirit and they are life.&quot;  Take them in at the expense of being called a spiritualist.  If it is spiritual things that are spoken of, what must be the nature of the meat given to the household of faith by the faithful and wise servant?  Jesus says `55th verse`, &quot;My flesh is meat indeed.&quot;  But the words which he is speaking </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> spirit.  Then he does not mean that his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">physical body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the thing spoken of; no, for &quot;the flesh profiteth nothing&quot; (O, that we could keep this in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when studying the nature of Christ's coming, and his dealings with the household of faith), and yet just before--`53d verse` he says, &quot;Except ye eat the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you.&quot;  Then the faithful and wise servant will be feeding the household of faith with the body and blood of Christ.  Then, as this is a figure, it must be that somehow we take in, and take on, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">character,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ; if we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;eat</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his flesh,&quot; is it not a strong mode of saying that we assimilate the essential principles that made up the Christ, and thus become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us consider, then, the apostle and high priest of our profession, Christ Jesus, that we may find what those principles are.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What was the great work which he proposed to accomplish?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;To save a world of sinners lost.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How did he begin that work?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">By </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">laying aside the glory</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which he had with the Father.  &quot;Though he was rich, yet for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">your sakes</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he became poor.&quot;  Humility, then, was the first blade that shot forth from the seed which was to become a tree, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">leaves</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of which should be for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">healing of the nations.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The &quot;mighty&quot; came down to man's estate, but the wondrous stoop was within sight, and so far as we have anything to sacrifice we are to imitate him.  Then the faithful and wise servant will have the household </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partake</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">humility</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ.  He will not be offering them bones of contention, nor setting them examples of arrogance and self-sufficiency; he will not by example nor precept have them partake of the spirit which on one occasion caused certain ones to contend &quot;who should be greatest,&quot; and certain ones at a later date, who should be &quot;leaders.&quot;  If any are leaders, and Christ appointed, they will be partaking of this humility, and by every means causing the household to partake of it also.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">After humbling himself by taking the body prepared for him, his first act (when the body was mature) was to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">formally</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> deliver it up to death; and this he signified by making a living picture (his baptism) of his submission to death and consequent sufferings preceding it, and of his resurrection.  Here is an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">important</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> element, that the faithful servant will be giving to the members of the household, though some may think that they can live without it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His next act was to submit to be led (but of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spirit)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> into the wilderness to be tempted, to be brought directly in contact with the powers of darkness.  To stand as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> alone in the presence of the ruler of the darkness of this world to be tempted. But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">why</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was he tempted?  It would not make him any purer nor better surely; he was without sin already.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He came down to the condition of the perfect man; he was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Adam.  The first Adam with no preference for evil, but having </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of its terrible nature, was tempted and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fell,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the second Adam, with no preference for evil, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of its </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">awful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> results, and of the power of God (By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many.  `Isaiah 53:11`), was as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">really</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> tempted, and triumphed.  He evidently was free and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">could</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have yielded; in fact, he was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tempted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> TO yield, but gloriously resisted and vanquished his foe.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now again we ask, why did he pass through this ordeal?  To </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">show</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us how</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to overcome.  Being the Captain of our salvation, the Leader of a little band of conquerors, his example was necessary, for through them &quot;all the families of the earth&quot; are to be blessed.  &quot;Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made&quot;...and that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;is Christ.&quot; `Gal. 3:16`.  Now, if we &quot;be Christ's (if we feed on him and partake of his life), then are we Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.&quot; `Gal. 3:29`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then here is a choice principle for the household to feed on; the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of Christ,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or Christ's knowledge. But, says one, his knowledge was divine, and though he was tempted, he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knew</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he would not be overcome. That is just the point we wish to make prominent right here.  He has opened for us the way to the same source of knowledge, divine word and spirit, and Christ's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to feed on.  But, says one, if I could </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">know,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as he did, that I would come out of the conflict all right I could endure it too.  But you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">would</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> know that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just as surely as he,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if you would feed on his knowledge.  Here is a bit of it, take it and let it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">strengthen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thine heart when trial comes, as it did his: &quot;God is faithful who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suffer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation also </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">make a way to escape,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that ye may be able</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bear</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it.&quot; `1 Cor. 10:13`. This is divine knowledge, and just the knowledge that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he had.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> If you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believe</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it and appropriate it, (feed on it) you will triumph just as he did.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But there are many other portions of knowledge that strengthened him for his labor of love and life of suffering, terminating with death, and the same knowledge will so strengthen and support us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These portions may be summarized under the general term of God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">plan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the salvation of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> O, how it fired him with love and zeal, and by parable and figure he held it up to the view of those whom he wished to have see it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, says one, did he not wish to have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> see it?  No, not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he only wished to have those see it who would </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">accept</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the blessed truth.  See `Matt. 13:13,14,15`, and `Matt. 7:6`. It was for those referred to by Paul (`Acts 13:26`), when he said, &quot;Whosoever among you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">feareth God,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to you is the word of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> salvation sent.&quot; There are yet many persons whose ears are dull of hearing, and such ones would and do trample upon these pearls.  This bread of life they reject.  Like the Pharisees of old, publicans and harlots will enter the kingdom before them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This knowledge which so supported him will so support us.  Modern Pharisees would withhold from us this love-begotten plan of God; but let the faithful servant give it plentifully to the household of faith.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We said he passed through this ordeal of temptation and suffering to show us </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">how</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to overcome, giving us the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same facilities for overcoming,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> knowledge of God's will and plan, and his Spirit to give us an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">understanding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">support</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But was this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all the world?  O, no, not directly; comparatively few of the world know, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ever</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> knew of it, and but few of those who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">do,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> care much about it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But his mission was twofold, to redeem the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole human race</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from death by his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the forfeit of sin), and to be the Leader of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;peculiar</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> people&quot; by his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and through this &quot;peculiar people&quot; in the &quot;ages to come,&quot; he is to show to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exceeding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> riches of his grace.&quot; (`Eph. 2:7`.)  His death for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (including those who became heirs) entitles them </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to life; the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same kind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of life lost in Adam; this is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;common salvation,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Jude 1:3`, and `1 Cor. 15:22`, and his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> vitalizes and raises to a high and glorious condition those who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hear</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believe</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the little flock), those who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">feed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on him, those who appropriate the divine which was in him, and thus are &quot;made partakers of the divine </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `2 Peter 1:3,4`; `Rom. 5:10`; `2 Cor. 4:11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We apprehend that the life of Christ </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by which we are saved</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (have life MORE </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">abundantly)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the life principle which manifested itself in a series of loving labors and sacrifices for the good of others, that such a life taken in, lived (eaten), is the begetting (through the spirit) of a higher life--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of immortality. This we understand to be &quot;the faith once delivered to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saints.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Jude 1:3`. This is &quot;the meat that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">endureth.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jesus said, `John 4:34`, &quot;My meat is to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">do the will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of him that sent me.&quot;  That was his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and if we partake of his life on earth, we shall be partakers of his resurrection life-- made &quot;like unto Christ's glorious body.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R327 : page 4::</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R328 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A WORD FROM BRO. A. D. JONES,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">OF ZION'S DAY STAR.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Most of ZION'S WATCH TOWER readers will remember, that some time ago we took the position that it was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than probable that the &quot;dead in Christ&quot; were raised, or were then being raised, and we yet believe that the position was a true one. One thing is certain, that if `Rev. 14:13`, is now due [and it seems to be], then the other is true; for we will not be changed until the dead are raised.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We believe that the words, &quot;from henceforth,&quot; are applicable at the present time.  This being understood </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is strong evidence that the time of favor to come into the &quot;little flock&quot; ended this last fall.  In harmony with the thought that the dead saints are raised, we refer our readers to `Rev. 19:5-16` &quot;And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and true, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.&quot;  This verse introduces Jesus as present in power; and by reading `Rev. 3:14` it will be observed that he is the &quot;Faithful and true witness,&quot; as John spoke of him in addressing the Laodicean Church.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This will help us in fixing the time of the above scene, because the nominal churches not having been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> witnesses were given up by him, spewed out of his mouth in the spring of 1878.  While Jesus is represented in that spiritual condition of power, there are also others with him.  &quot;And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.&quot; `Verse 14`.  This company must be the risen dead, for the &quot;fine linen&quot; &quot;represents the righteous acts of the saints;&quot; (`verse 8`: E, D,) so that if Jesus is now present in the spiritual body [judging and making war in righteousness, `verse 11`], they must be also, for both are represented in the same spiritual [heavenly] condition.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">According to the parallel, Jesus was due to enter on his Kingly office in the spring of 1878, and so when seen in power with his armies, &quot;He hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.&quot; `Verse 16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While Jesus and the dead saints are shown as in the heavenly, spiritual condition, the living saints who are not yet changed, are used as his mouthpiece.  &quot;And a voice came out of the throne [through them], saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.&quot; `Verse 5`.  Is it not significant that the teachings are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the servants, believing, as we do, that the door is shut to the high calling? &quot;And out of his mouth (the saints his mouthpiece) goeth a sharp sword, the word of truth, that with it he should smite the nations.&quot; `Verse 15`. And again, &quot;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him [the living saints his feet] that bringeth good tidings [restitution], that publisheth peace;...that saith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.&quot; `Isa. 52:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And his name is called the word of God,&quot; so we would proclaim no other </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">word.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Our teachings are not the &quot;doctrines of men,&quot; but God's Word.  Some may say we are not right in our teachings, for &quot;he had a name written that no man knew but he himself.&quot; `Verse 12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">No man [unregenerated] does know, but we (his body) may know, for the name written is &quot;King of kings and Lord of lords.&quot;  Do we not proclaim Jesus as now in this position, having entered on his Kingly office--and moreover, that the dead saints are risen, &quot;kings and priests&quot; unto God, so that Jesus is King of heavenly kings?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But no man knew &quot;but he himself.&quot; True, but we are of him, we are the members of his body: his &quot;feet,&quot; therefore a part of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">himself.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Dear saints, what a glorious position is ours. The nominal churches have been spewed out of his mouth, they are in darkness, and know not that Jesus has entered on his reign as King; and hence they know not the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">written;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor do the servants yet know, for they are not of his body, not reckoned as part of Himself. What could more clearly set forth our relationship to him than those words which reveal to us </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that name?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It also indicates that we shall soon enter on our reign with him and his armies.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A WORD FROM BRO. J. B. ADAMSON.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">BELOVED IN CHRIST:--After several months engaged in distributing and preaching the Gospel, you will doubtless be glad to hear from me again.  I have had good opportunities for observing how this Gospel of the grace of God is received by the different classes in and out of the nominal churches.  Only those who go forth into the world, with the real Gospel of gladness, can have a full idea of the joy and rejoicing of God's true people, when presented with these truths.  And only such can realize how bitter is the opposition of many of the clergy (Scribes) and false religionists (Pharisees) who abound in the churches now, as they did in the Jewish.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I worked in nearly all the large towns of twenty states, being present also at nearly all the leading Camp Meetings, Conferences, and Assemblies of the year: distributing thousands of books, and addressing many people.  At Camp Meetings it was impossible to give away books with much discrimination, but after the season for such gatherings ended, I found time and place for seasonable words about our hope, joy, heirship, and the restitution of the world at &quot;the manifestation of the sons of God.&quot;  I soon began to realize what a blessed work I was engaged in, and the glorious privilege of being a mouthpiece for the Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The true people of God who are really making good their promises of entire consecration of all to the Lord, received me with every sign of gratitude and love, and praise to God for this message of grace and love, expressing surprise that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Food&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had reached them, and gratitude to God for &quot;meat in due season.&quot;  Limited in time, I devoted it principally to those who seemed to &quot;have an ear to hear&quot;--the truth hungry, passing by those who seemed to think themselves rich and increased in goods and needing nothing; thus following the example of our Forerunner--convinced that now, as then, no man can come into the light except the Father draw him by his Word and Spirit of truth. There is no inducement of a worldly character to lead one of the world-conforming, Babylon people into the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">narrow</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> way and race for glory.  On the contrary, this teaching is most repulsive to the larger portion of the nominal church, and those who deliver them are continually subject to contempt, reproach, and dishonor. Those who for years have been carrying the honors of the world with the name of Christ in self-indulgence, feel outraged by the teaching that glory, honor, and immortality will only be given to those who take up their cross, deny self, and follow their Leader in a life separate from the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Most bitter in their opposition are the clergy who doubtless feel their craft endangered--some of whom obtained the books from their people when I was gone and burned them.  This was especially true among the sect calling themselves &quot;Second Adventists,&quot; strange as it may seem.  They greatly fear, that which they cannot gainsay.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I now gladly recur to the effect of the truths we hold, upon the dear sainted people of God who only are the church--yet for the present much mixed up in Babylon except to God's clear vision.  These were glad to get out of her, and hailed the message and the result, as a deliverance from sin.  Many infidels and worldly people got to hear the message also, and often spoke of God's plan in the ages, as something reasonable, and as demonstrating his Wisdom, Justice, and Love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Being a willing instrument in God's hand, subject to any use I can be fitted to, I now try a preaching tour, and expect to meet many of the brethren and labor together with them.  Again desiring your prayers, I remain your brother and fellow worker in Christ Jesus.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SACRIFICE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I entreat you, therefore, brethren, by the tender compassions of God, to present your bodies a living </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> holy, well-pleasing, to God-- your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rational</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> religious service--`Rom. 12:1`. --Diaglott.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There is very much involved in the above quotation.  In fact all that precedes it, to which the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> refers, as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reason</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> why a certain thing should be done; but we will call especial attention to the term </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is translated from the Greek word, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thusia,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and means a slaughter, or an animal slaughtered.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have natural--animal--bodies now--`1 Cor. 15:44-46`; and if we have accepted of Jesus as our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they are not our own, but have been bought with a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">price;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and we are exhorted to present them a living sacrifice, to be slaughtered--killed. But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">why</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> give them?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There must certainly be a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reason</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for so doing.  The term bodies seems to include all there is of our earthly existence.  Jesus gave his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a ransom for many--`Matt. 20:28`--and he gave his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Heb. 10:10`.  All there was of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jesus, was given as ransom--`1 Tim. 2:5,6`.-- and we are exhorted to have the same mind that was in him. `Phil. 2:5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As he became obedient unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so ought </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Hereby have we known love, that as he laid down his life for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we ought to lay down </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brethren.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `1 John 3:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bodies</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">High Priest,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for sin, are BURNED without the camp.  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.  Let </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> go forth therefore unto him without the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">camp,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> bearing the reproach-- `Heb. 13:11-13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To present our bodies a living sacrifice, then, means to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">crucified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Christ; baptized into his death; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with him as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but alive unto God as new creatures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The proclamations of `Rev. 14:6-11` having been given; Paul's mystery, &quot;we shall not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all sleep,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is now due. And from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this time,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;Blessed are the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the Lord,&quot; they shall not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleep</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--become inactive--but be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and while they will have ended the toil and weariness of this present condition of corruption, of dishonor and weakness, they will be changed to a condition of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruption;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> glory and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;their works follow </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant by sacrifice.&quot; `Ps. 50:2-5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Many seem to get the idea that all that is required, is to give a certain portion of our time and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">substance.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Cain came with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a sacrifice, and it was not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">received.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Abel offered an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">animal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">killed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> typifying the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">better</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sacrifice, and it was accepted. If we present </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ourselves</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we will surely present all we have also.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R328 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;WHAT IS MAN?&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou visiteth him?  For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.  Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hand; thou hast put all things under his feet: All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field.&quot; (`Psa. 8:4-8`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We believe that a failure to rightly understand what constitutes A PERFECT MAN, is a fruitful source of error among christians, and tends to shroud in mystery, many Scriptures otherwise easily understood.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is the common view, but we think unsupported by a single text of Scripture, that a perfect man has never been seen on earth--in fact that all that is seen of man on earth is only the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">embryo,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> imperfect, undeveloped man; that to reach the perfection of his nature </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(perfect manhood)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he must become a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">being</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> like unto angels, etc.  This view, we think, sadly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mixes</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Scriptures, (as well as students) instead of developing harmony and beauty, by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;rightly dividing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the word of truth.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand the Scriptures to teach that there have been only two </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--Adam and Jesus-- Adam was created in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">image</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God: A </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fleshly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> image of a spiritual being; an image, in the sense that he possessed capacity for reasoning, planing, ruling, and protecting--for Benevolence, Justice, and Love, and ability to execute these, in earthly matters: characteristics which resembled his Creator.  To such an extent he is an image, that God can say &quot;Come, let us reason together.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As Jehovah is ruler over </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> things, so, man was made a ruler over </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (earthly) things--&quot;In our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">likeness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> let him have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dominion&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--over the beast, foul, fish, etc.  Thus as our text declares, God crowned him with</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R329 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">glory and honor and placed him (in dominion) over earth.  Thus David agrees with the account in Genesis, as to man's high honors originally-- with all earthly) things under his feet, or subject to him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Genesis tells us, that God recognized the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whom he had made (not merely </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">commenced</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to make, but completed) and God considered his creature &quot;Very </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  David in our text expresses the same thought when he says: &quot;Thou hast made him a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">little</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> lower than the angels.&quot; (Not a little </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">while,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as if a matter of time, but clearly and distinctly a little lower in degree.)  Should we say then, that because man was a little lower, it means that he was a little </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">less perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than angels?  Nay, but they were totally different kinds of beings; the one a lower degree of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual being,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of which Jehovah is the highest; the other, the highest degree of animal (or earthly--fleshly) being, of which beasts, fouls, etc., are the lower degrees.  Yet the highest of these earthly creatures was &quot;a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">little</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> lower than the angels,&quot; or lowest order of spiritual beings-- Yet both were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> each according to his nature.  Yes, God created man perfect and upright but he sought out many inventions through sin, by which he has woefully degenerated.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Ah yes, there is a wonderful contrast between </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as we now see him, degraded by sin, and the perfect creature God called &quot;very good.&quot; Sin has gradually exchanged the expression and features.  Hundreds of generations of ignorance, licentiousness, and general depravity, have so changed humanity, that it is no longer an IMAGE of the Divine. The moral and intellectual qualities are dwarfed and the animal propensities overgrown.  He has lost physical strength to such an extent, that with all the aid of medical science, his average of life is about thirty years, whereas, at first, he survived nine hundred and thirty years under the same penalty.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Man, who was thus degraded and defiled by sin and its penalty death, working in him, is to be restored to his original perfection of mind and body, and to glory, honor, and dominion, during, and by, the Millennial reign of Christ; because his ransom has been found in the person of Christ; and &quot;as in (or by) Adam all die, even so, in (or by) Christ shall all be made alive.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:22`.) The things to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restored</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by and through Christ, are those things which were lost through Adam's sin. (`Rom. 5:18,19`.)  Man did not lose a heavenly, but an earthly paradise. Under the death penalty, he did not lose a spiritual, but a human existence; and all that was lost is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">purchased</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> back by his REDEEMER.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If any one be not yet satisfied that Adam was a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> MAN, we can furnish </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">conclusive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> proof that the perfect MAN is not a spiritual being, as follows:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus in his pre-human existence, was, we are told, &quot;in a form of God,&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he was a spiritual form or being, but since to be a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for mankind, he must be a MAN, and of the same nature as the sinner whose </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">substitute</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in death he was to become, therefore it was necessary, for him to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change his nature;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and Paul tells us that he took not, or changed not, to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature of angels,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature of men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--he became a man. (`Heb. 2:16`.)  Now notice, that this teaches not only that angelic nature is not the only one on the spiritual plane of being, but that it is a lower plane or nature than that which Jesus was before he became a man.  And Jesus was not then so </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">high</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as he is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for--Him hath God highly exalted: (`Phil. 2:9`), because of his becoming our RANSOM.  He is now of the highest form of spiritual being --a partaker of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Jehovah's) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, not only do we thus find that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Divine, Angelic,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> natures are separate, distinct, and totally different; but this proves that to be a perfect MAN, is not to be an angel, any more than to be a perfect angel implies that they must become equal with Jehovah, for Jesus took not the nature of angels, but a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">different</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> NATURE--the nature and form of men; not the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imperfect human nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as we possess it now, degraded and marked by sin, but--A PERFECT HUMAN NATURE.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus must have been a perfect man, else he could not have kept a perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Law,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which was the full measure of a perfect man's ability. He must have been a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> else he could not have given a ransom for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imperfect, sinful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> MEN; for since by MAN came death, by MAN also came the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to a) resurrection of the dead.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:21`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now we have the question fairly, in another form, viz.: If Jesus in the FLESH was a perfect MAN, does it not prove that a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is a human and fleshly being, full of the glorious IMAGE of his Creator, and crowned with glory and honor--&quot;a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">little lower</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than the angels,&quot; and not an angel, not like angels, nor in any sense a being of their order and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Paul so teaches in `Heb. 2:9`. [I know your questions and texts and will answer quickly.]  Let me go further, and say that if Adam was a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man, any subtraction or addition (except of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must render the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">manhood</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> IMPERFECT, for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> cannot be made MORE </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, look at the second perfect man, Jesus: Possessed of all the qualities of perfect manhood, he could not be made more perfect as a man. He possessed all those qualities of perfection (shown but slightly in his sacrificial life), which could have commanded obedience of all imperfect men.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Under promise of an after high exaltation, from the human to the divine nature; to glory, honor, and immortality, he consecrated all human (earthly) hopes, aims, interests, pleasures, and with them human NATURE, too, to death.  Because it is impossible to possess two natures at the same time, the human nature was given up to death before the divine nature could be received.  The human (&quot;form of a servant&quot;) was only taken for the purpose of becoming our ransom--&quot;that he by the grace of God, might taste death for every man.&quot; (`Heb. 2:9`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He received the divine nature fully, when, having been put to death in the flesh, he was quickened, raised to life, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Spirit.  He received an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earnest,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or foretaste of this birth to the divine (Jehovah's) nature, when he was begotten of the Spirit.  When 30 years of age, he commenced his ministry by consecration, typified in baptism, and was sealed as accepted to the divine nature, by the Holy Spirit of promise. (`John 6:27`; `Eph. 1:13`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And now, he who paid our ransom, and is to bless and restore man to perfection, and then to restore the dominion of earth to him--blessed with knowledge of good and evil to such an extent that he will be able always thereafter, to choose the good; this one, now highly exalted above angels and men, and of a higher nature than either, sharing the perfection of the divine nature, is selecting a &quot;little flock&quot; to share with him those honors, and to partake of that same divine nature. (`2 Pet. 1:4`.) They, as joint heirs, are, with him, to be engaged in blessing and restoring mankind to the perfection of their nature--the human, with all the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earthly glory</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and dominion as at first, but with knowledge and appreciation increased.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Because the present age is devoted exclusively to the development of those who shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> their nature --Christ and his Bride; and because the epistles of the apostles are devoted to the description of the interests of the &quot;little flock&quot; and the prize for which they are now running a race, it should not be inferred that God's plans end with the completion of that choice company.  Nor, on the other hand, should we go to the opposite extreme, and suppose that these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">choice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> things--divine nature, spiritual bodies, etc., are God's design for ALL </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mankind.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  No, to rightly divide the word of truth, we should see that the Scriptures recognize the perfection of the divine nature in the little flock, and of the human nature in the restored world, as two separate things.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The same Word of God contains earthly promises and &quot;heavenly promises&quot;; and it symbolically likens the earthly class to the &quot;sands of the sea,&quot; and the heavenly class to &quot;the stars of heaven.&quot; (`Gen. 22:17`.)  Of the one class it is said: All the LAND which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever. (`Gen. 13:15`.) &quot;And they shall build houses and inhabit them; plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them and long enjoy the work of their hands.&quot; (`Isa. 65:21,22`.)  To the other class, who will change their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from human to spiritual--divine promises are made--&quot;EXCEEDING GREAT </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">precious</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> promises&quot; (`2 Pet. 1:4`.)-- &quot;heavenly promises.&quot;  Theirs is a &quot;heavenly calling,&quot; a calling to a heavenly or spiritual condition; it is a call to become joint heirs with Jesus, and to sit with him &quot;in his throne.&quot;  This heavenly calling is confined to the Gospel age; was never made before it, and will, as the Scriptures inform us, never be made after this age.  The earthly call, was made before the high calling, and we are Scripturally told will follow after, the Gospel age.  It is during the Millennial age that mankind will have the glorious opportunity of reaching human perfection, and earthly glory, honor, and dominion; their right to that restoration having been purchased by the sacrifice of the humanity of the Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, who cannot see a distinction between these natures, and that, though both will finally reach perfection (except those who are &quot;cast away&quot; as unworthy), yet, because of different natures, the perfected creatures will be totally dissimilar, except that in common they will have dispositions to do the Creator's will.  We know that they will be thus alike--in harmony--one, because the perfect human was made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">an image</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the perfect divine.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Beloved, it will help you amazingly to keep clearly in view these differences of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">calling</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It will enable you to see why, we who would attain the high, spiritual promises should not look to Samson, Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob as illustrations of--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">crucifying the flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--or following in the footsteps of Jesus; they were running for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earthly prize,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heavenly.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Look unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the pattern and illustration of how we ought to so run as to win the spiritual prize.  He was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to run for the spiritual prize, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;forerunner,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Leader.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Look, too, to others who ran in his footsteps, Peter, Paul, James, John, etc.  These are illustrious examples, of those who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">crucify</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the human nature and sacrifice it, if by so doing they might attain the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature offered--the prize of our high-calling.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While your steps and mine may not shine so brightly as the mentioned apostles', yet the only difference in our sacrifices and work, should be those of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ability</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">opportunity.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wills</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should be as thoroughly sanctified as theirs; and if so, we may feel assured that our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is as well pleasing and acceptable to our Father by Jesus Christ, as was theirs.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But fall not into the error of supposing that crucifying the flesh means the putting away of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  No, Jehovah would never accept sins as a sacrifice.  Sins should be put away, shunned, exterminated to the best of your ability; but you sacrifice, when you deny yourself personal ease, comfort, pleasures </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lawful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the natural man, but which you relinquish, to do something which you recognize as the will of God.  In our crucifying, etc., we are to follow in Jesus' footsteps.  Did his sacrifice consist in forsaking sins?  No, in Him was no sin to forsake; but he denied himself things lawful and proper to him as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> even life itself--and thus sacrificed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To show the contrast, we will look at Paul as compared with modern preachers.  Many preachers of this day, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">choose</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the ministry as &quot;a profession&quot; which is honorable, has the respect of the world, and a comfortable and easy living, etc.  Paul was called to the ministry by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grandeur</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the &quot;glad tidings of great joy&quot;--he could not help preaching it, so overwhelmed was he by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;high calling,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so anxious to obtain it for himself and to enable others to attain the same.  He preached it despite the persecution, disgrace, and frown of the world--at the sacrifice of earthly opportunities, honors, ease, pleasures; and accounted it a pleasure to be permitted to preach, even though, instead of luxury, he was obliged to &quot;labor, working with his hands&quot; at very humble employment, and was often in hunger and poverty and danger.  He was willing to endure all this, because he had a correct appreciation of the good tidings he preached, and of the prize it presented. And it is from a failure to apprehend either of these that the clergy of to-day deserve the severe</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R330 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">words applied to them by the prophet: &quot;His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant; they are all dumb dogs; they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber: yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough--and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they all look to their own way [self-interest], every one for his gain from his quarter.&quot; `Isa. 56:10,11`.  Because they hold the traditions of men, they cannot see the great prize of our calling.  They have not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;good</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> news,&quot; but very BAD NEWS to tell--the very worst and most </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">awful news</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that could be imagined, viz.: That the God of love, possessed of all power and all wisdom, prearranged for the eternal misery of nine-tenths of his human creatures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Oh, when will God's children learn that their fear toward Him is taught by the precepts and traditions of men (read `Isa. 29:10-14`), and that his true character is Love?  When will they learn that it is because &quot;His mercy endureth forever&quot; that he has provided for human restitution in the next age, and for the development of the little flock in the present age, through whom to communicate the coming blessings to earth.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE REVIVAL SEASON.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The spiritual barrenness in our local churches has been the cause of great anxiety to the official and leading men in them, and has led to some prayer and efforts for the betterment of this condition of things.  The net addition to the Presbyterian churches of the North during the last ecclesiastical year was a fraction of one convert to each church.  In some parts of the country the Congregationalists have not had a dozen additions to their churches in the same number of years.  Baptists and Methodists do a little better but not much.  The net addition of Baptists to the 874 churches of their faith, in this State for the last ecclesiastical year, for instance, is only 286, which is about one-third of a member for each church.  More than one-half of the churches had not a single convert.  The proportion of Methodists is between two and three new members to each church of their order.  In view of these facts and figures the Presbytery of New York, the Baptists' Association and the Ministers' Conference of both Baptists and Methodists have endeavored to increase the number and improve the quality of their church members and converts, by special efforts begun with the new year and continued with much regularity and interest since.  Days of special prayer have been held and evangelists, male and female, have been brought hither from other cities and states.&quot; --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">New Yew Herald.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It might be added that nearly all of the additions above mentioned, few though they be, are from the Sunday schools; and many of them, so young as to be incapable of intelligent action.  Few, very few, are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">converts</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the true sense of the word.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, the church is losing the worldly respect which for some years has been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> great attraction for the worldly element.  They, as well as the most pious of God's true children are getting ashamed of the hollowness of Churchianity.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">MILLENNIAL KINGDOM OF CHRIST</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">AND ITS WORK.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Revelation 20 to 22` contains eight portraits of the true Kingdom, just as we have seen that `chapters 12`, `13` and `17` contain repeated descriptions of the false Kingdom--Anti-Christ's.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This repetition of the same things from different standpoints, and with other details, is a principle which applies especially to this last book of the Bible.  A failure to recognize this, is, we think one of the reasons why so many of those who study this book, fail to get sense from it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The portion of Scripture we are about to consider, is frequently read as though it were one connected narrative, instead of several repetitions of the first statement.  Because of failure to rightly divide, some get the thought, that the &quot;great white throne&quot; is to be established after the Millennial age, and after Satan is destroyed; consequently, are at a loss to know why the dead are raised at that time, or how they could have a probation </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Millennial Age, and are much confused generally.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To better illustrate the distinctness and harmony of these portraits, we have diagramed them as follows:</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SATAN BOUND.--EVIL RESTRAINED.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us more particularly examine these pictures, all of which clearly pertain to the same period, the Millennial Age.  The first, shows us that a restraint will be put upon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">evil,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> during that age of peace and blessing.  This naturally commends itself to us, as the order for a reign of righteousness presupposes a restraint of unrighteousness.  Satan is the best representative of evil principles, practices and persons, being the chief and leader in wickedness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">An angel is seen, with the key of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">abyss,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (covered, secret, hidden place,) and a chain.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">key</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> represents authority, and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">chain</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> represents strength.  The word angel signifies </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">messenger,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and this picture shows us, that God will send some messenger with authority and power to subdue Evil--the adversary of truth and right.  In this work of binding, many agencies will doubtless take a part--an increase of knowledge probably being one of the strongest.  Yet all of these agents, are typified by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> messenger.  There is that about this figure, which seems to indicate that Christ Jesus, and his body, the church of the first born, is the one in whose hand is the power and authority to bind and control Evil--&quot;To bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgments written--this honor have all his saints.&quot; (`Ps. 149:8,9`.) The language, too, reminds us of one who declares that he has the keys. (`Rev. 1:18`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The binding or suppression of evil during the Millennial Age, will result from the exercise of authority and power, by our Lord, when he shall take unto himself his great power and reign. (`Rev. 11:17`.)  But we have reason to think that the manner in which our Lord </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">takes</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his great power, and binds Evil, will differ much from the general conception of it.  We believe that truth binds error, and error binds truth: like light and darkness, they are constantly opposed to each other.  During this Age the powers of darkness and error hold control; but light and truth will come with the new rulership.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We believe that this New Ruler has already come, (visible only, as are all the glorious and spiritual things, to the eye of faith enlightened by the Word of God,) and that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">binding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is already commenced.  As is God's rule--&quot;Judgment [trial] must begin at the House of God.&quot; (`1 Pet. 4:17`.)  Errors and evils-- the devil in the church, must be bound first, and truth set free, among those who profess to be children of the light; and then it will progress, overturning errors, injustice and bad government among the World's people --thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">blessing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> both nominal church and world, though the experience may for a time, seem a curse to both.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Many may be the instruments used in this work; some fine and polished tools from the Lord's laboratory; some moral and upright Infidels, honest in their unbelief; and some God-dishonoring and defiant unbelievers; to displace errors and prepare a place for truth.  So too, among the nations, he may make the wrath of man to praise him, and perhaps use bloody-handed Communists, as advocates of civil rights, and for the overthrow of evil and oppressive governments.  But the result will be, that Satan shall be bound for a thousand years.  The loosing for a little season, we will examine presently.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment [Rotherham--judicial </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sentence]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was given unto them.&quot;  The thrones are those of earthly kingdoms at the present time, and all under the &quot;prince of this world.&quot; (`John 14:30`)  These are all condemned as unfit, and are to be overthrown, to give place to the kingdom of Christ.  [The Greek word rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judgment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> here, is the same rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">condemnation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the following passages: `Luke 23:40`; `Jas. 3:1`; `Jude 4`.]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And I saw the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">persons</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the Word of God.&quot;  We believe that a few of this class are now living.  It is not a literal beheading, but in keeping with other figures; it is a symbolic beheading.  [Some suppose this to refer to all the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">martyrs</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of past ages-- but of them the fewest number were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">beheaded.]</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Beheading, is to cut off from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  There are many so called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bodies</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ: the Methodist body, Presbyterian body, etc., are common expressions.  (The Scriptures, of course, recognize no such division into sects; but assure us that there is only one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and one head.)  Of course, each body must have a head or authority, from whence comes its government and laws.  These are Conferences, Assemblies, etc., and we predict that any one connected with any of these who will &quot;witness for Jesus,&quot; as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> head of the church, and for the &quot;Word of God,&quot; as the only standard of doctrine, will very quickly be treated as described--beheaded--cut off from those church heads.  This is in harmony with the next clause</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R331 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">which says they worshiped not the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Beast,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> neither his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Image,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> neither received his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mark.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  These, we saw in our last number, represent sectarian systems.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This Scripture shows that such as are of this bounden class, not separated --beheaded--cut off--from others than the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true head,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are not overcomers, while the class described, of all ages, who will live and reign with Christ a thousand years, are.  &quot;This is the first resurrection.&quot; (`Vs. 5`.--We omit the first clause of the verse, which, as heretofore explained, is wanting in several of the oldest MSS.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This reference to the first resurrection, seems to indicate that it includes all of the first fruits company--both those who &quot;sleep in Jesus,&quot; and the living who shall not sleep, but be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at the moment of death.*</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This seems scarcely to require comment.  It shows the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">holiness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as well as blessedness of all that reigning company.  Another thought is suggested, by the fact that these shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">priests</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to teach, as well as kings to reign.  They will not only see to the execution of God's laws, but will give instruction and assistance to mankind, such as will enable them to render obedience.  Yes, it is a blessed thought, that we will be both kings and priests, (`Rev. 5:10`) and reign with him a thousand years.</font><br />

This kingdom over earth, after subduing all evil, will cease by being delivered up to God, even the Father (Jehovah), as Paul tells us: &quot;He must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet: [in subjection]  The last enemy that shall be destroyed, is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [The destruction of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> implies the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raising</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of mankind out of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to perfection of humanity: abolishing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and all of its incipient stages of sickness, pain, etc.  This will be a gradual process, requiring all of &quot;the times (1,000 years) of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for its complete accomplishment.]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It should be remembered, that to humanity the Millennial Age is not the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfecting</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> age, to be followed by that which is perfect; even as to the Bride of Christ, the Gospel Age is not the perfect, but the perfecting period, to be followed by ages of glory and perfection, of which the Millennial is the first.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And when </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> things shall be put under him, then shall the Son, also, himself be subject unto him (Jehovah) that put all things under him [that gave him the power]; that God may be all in all.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:25,28`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But since all things before presentation to Jehovah must be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whatever their nature; and since no sin is to go beyond the Millennial Age; therefore, it would seem but proper, that those who had experienced the blessings of knowledge and restitution, should be proved or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tested,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before they should be considered sin-proof.  Having then reached, perfection of being and having had a previous knowledge of sin and its results, perfect obedience should be expected.  Therefore Satan --evil--will be loosed a little season, in order that it may be manifested,</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">*The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> here rendered resurrection signifies--&quot;a standing or rising up&quot;--to bring to perfection.  The bringing to perfection of mankind in general, will be a gradual work, requiring all of the Millennial Age, while the resurrection or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bringing to perfection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Bride of Christ--the little flock, will be instantaneous, and at the beginning of the Millennial Age.  Remember, too, that though both reach </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfection,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> yet one is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the other </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> perfection.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The attainment of the divine perfection is called the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection, and signifies the chief or best perfection. The same Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(protos)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">best</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `Luke 15:22`, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">chief</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `Acts 13:50`; `16:12`; `17:4`; `25:2`; `28:7`; `7:17`, etc.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">whether their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obedience</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> results from a fear of the punishment of evil doing, or from a heart love of God, and a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">desire</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to do those things well pleasing to him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As evil will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bound</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the infliction of punishment on the evil doer, so we may presume, it will be loosed by allowing evil deeds for a time to go </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unpunished;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> much as it is during this age. (See `Mal. 3:15-18`.)  With full liberty to do good or evil, the actions of each individual, will show his true disposition.  Some will remain faithful, called holy ones (saints) others from among all nations.  (The world will then be very populous-- &quot;as the sand of the sea&quot;), will join the insurrection of evil; and the two classes will thus be manifested. (`Vs. 7-10`.) Then fire--judgments--will come upon them, and they will all be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone, [fire representing judgment, trouble, and brimstone representing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">extinction of life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life is proof against the fumes of brimstone-- hence the force of the symbol, as a representative of extinction.]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The trouble and judgment into which the devil and those followers will be cast, is of the same sort as that into which the symbolic BEAST AND FALSE PROPHET, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(image)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are cast at the end of this Gospel Age. These we have seen to be symbols, representing, not persons but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">systems:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">systems</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are said to go </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">alive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (while they are yet active and powerful systems) into the same lake of fire or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">gehenna</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fire of trouble and destruction.  This </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fire,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">already</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> burning we think; beginning to torment those systems and to cause pain to all who do not recognize their true characters, and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">end</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God has marked out for them-- destruction.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The throne or kingdom of Christ will be a pure--a righteous one, here symbolized by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">white,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the symbol of peace and purity.  &quot;A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom.&quot; (`Heb. 1:8`.)</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who sat in the throne represents The Christ--primarily Jesus, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but also the overcomers who sit with him or share his glory and power (`Rev. 3:21`)--yet all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now call to mind the definitions of the symbols, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earth, heaven,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sea,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> given in our last issue; you will find them of service here: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heaven</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--spiritual control; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--organized society; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sea</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the turbulent masses without religious restraint.  From before, or at the presence of, this enthroned Christ, all forms of evil oppression and injustice must flee--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no place</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is found for them, indicating that they will be driven from one place </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> another, but can remain nowhere.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Earth--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">society</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--as at present organized, is a series of layers, or strata, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">classes,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> each holding its position by oppressing those below it.  (This </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">class</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> oppression is less in degree, in this land than in any other; yet even here, social caste is easily discernable.)  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;lower classes&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;upper crust&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are recognizable in the entire social fabric; both in the nominal church, and in the world. The upper classes are usually proud and haughty--the meek are oftenest found in the under strata, among the oppressed.  The present system of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">society</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will pass away--not be permitted anywhere, when the throne of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Justice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is established in the earth; and a new earth (system of society) will take its place; viz.: the recognition of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">merit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not of pride and power. Then, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to God and mankind will be the ruling principle.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This change of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(earth)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> society begins immediately on the commencement of the dominion of Christ's kingdom.  (This, we understand the Word of God to teach, was due in the spring of 1878.  If correct, the elements for the overturning should already be in preparation--and we believe they are.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A symbolic statement by the prophet (`Isa. 24:1,2`) is in keeping with the above exposition, God says he will turn the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> up-side-down --the &quot;upper crust&quot;--the proud, will be debased and the humble and meek will be exalted.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another prophecy, often mis-applied by &quot;Second Adventists,&quot; and others, and supposed to mean that the earth will be melted by fire, and when cooled off, be a perfectly flat surface, without hills or mountains, and thus a new earth, is found in `Isa. 40:4`.  &quot;Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: the crooked (perverse) shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.&quot;  This we understand to be but another way of showing that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">society</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (earth) is to be reconstructed and equality of classes obtain, in which individual merit will be recognized, blended with humility and benevolence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, not only does the present (&quot;earth&quot;) society pass away, but also the present </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;heavens&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or spiritual powers of control.  Satan is declared to be &quot;the prince of the power of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">air&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (heavens) who &quot;now worketh (operates or rules) in the children of disobedience.&quot; (`Eph. 2:2`)  This one called at present, &quot;The prince of this world&quot; (`John 14:30`), we have seen, is to be bound; consequently his control, or spiritual power, now exercised in favor of evil doing, etc., will cease, or pass away; gradually, because his binding, as shown by some prophecies, will not be fully accomplished for some 33 years.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The fact that the present &quot;earth&quot; and &quot;heaven,&quot; are to be succeeded by, or give place to, a &quot;new earth&quot; (society), and a &quot;new heaven&quot; (new spiritual powers of control also unseen, good and not evil--of Christ and not of Satan), is not here mentioned, but is afterward.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And I saw the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> small and great (high and low--humble and proud) stand before God; and the books were opened--and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That this will not be a marshaling of mankind in ranks, and rows, before a literal Judgment-bench, we have heretofore shown.  We believe that the world of mankind, during their day (age) for trial of worthiness or unworthiness of perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will be tried in a similar way to that in which certain ones are now being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tried</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tested</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in this day (Gospel age), to prove whether worthy or unworthy of the perfection of the DIVINE nature.  The Greek word here rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judged,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has the significance of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tried</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or tested.  Paul's use of the same word will prove this. We here give a quotation, in which he uses the same word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(krino)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> three times: (We italicize the words translated from this Greek word.)  &quot;Dare any of you, having a matter against another, (1) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">go to law</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before the unjust, and not before the saints?  Do ye not know that the saints (2) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the world? and if the world (3) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall be judged</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?&quot; (`1 Cor. 6:1,2`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here Paul refers to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">coming</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> trial of the world, when the overcomers of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> trial, shall be their judges--judges, who like their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Head,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jesus, will not only be able to assist the world as the kings, but also to sympathize with them--having been themselves tempted, in all points.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The first illustration gives it clearly --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;go to law&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stand trial.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> includes all of the Adamic race, who, during this Gospel age do not escape from the condemnation that is on the world-- DEATH--by becoming partakers of spiritual life through Jesus.  &quot;By the offence of one [Adam] judgment came upon all men to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">condemnation,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but there is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus;&quot; for the law of life in Christ made such free from the condemnation of death. (`Rom. 5:18`; and `8:1,2`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As during this age a little fragment of humanity escapes condemnation (death), by obtaining </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life offered on certain conditions, so we understand the world are to be privileged to escape from the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death condemnation,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by obedience to certain laws of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life.  Their right to this privilege of running for life comes as a consequence of Jesus having ransomed them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This verse relative to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the dead,</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R332 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">shows us how all those death condemned ones, will be on trial before the White Throne.  And so surely as it is a throne of purity and Justice, their trial, as ours now, will be full, fair and impartial.  The Judge himself, has already become their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bail,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so that they shall have a full and sufficient trial before himself, to attain </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of human life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">books</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> opened, according to the rulings of which they will be tried, we understand to be the books of the Bible.  The church, now on trial, is being judged according to these same books--and none now are on trial, to whom those books are not to some degree </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">opened</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (understood). This too, accords with Jesus' words: &quot;My words shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you in the last day (period)--the Millennial day. `John 12:48`.  (The word here translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the same word as in our text and in `1 Cor. 6:1`.  And the same word is rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;sue at</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the law&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `Matt. 5:40`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The words of Jesus will no longer be hidden under parables and dark sayings, that hearing the people might hear and not understand; but the secret things will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">uncovered</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (&quot;The mystery of God&quot;--the church --being finished) the books will be opened, and the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the whole earth.  For God &quot;will have all men to be saved, [redeemed] and [then] to come unto the knowledge of the truth.&quot; `1 Tim. 2:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R333 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The `succeeding verse` is in harmony, and says that &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sea</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (masses of mankind not under religious restraint) delivered up the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which were in it:&quot; i.e. mankind will be taken out of that condition, and brought under the restraints of the White Throne. (Consequently, when all are restrained there will be &quot;no more </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sea&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- see `Jude 13`, `Jas. 1:6`.)  &quot;And death and the tomb delivered up the dead which were in them, and they were judged every man according to their works.&quot;  (During that age or day.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This trial includes all the world, (but, not the saints--`John 5:24`,) and is indeed the grand prospect held out before them.  By means of that trial, the entire groaning creation, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">may</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty (freedom from death) of the sons of God. `Rom. 8:21,22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another book--of life, was opened. This suggests to us that as there is a book (record), of life, in which the names of all the Gospel Age overcomers are recorded, who are worthy of divine life, so there will be a book or record kept in the next age of those worthy of perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The book of life now about finished, will not be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">opened</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the results or record will not be known until the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">full</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> end of this age; then we will see those deemed worthy to be of the Bride the Lamb's wife: so too, the records of the next age, will not be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">opened</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until the end of that age, when those worthy of receiving back the dominion of earth, lost by Adam, will receive it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another feature of difference between the world's judgment of that age and ours of this, is, that though they will be required to have faith, yet their trial will be based on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">works</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --&quot;judged according to their works.&quot; We, on the contrary, live in an age when perfect works are impossible, and our judgment depends largely on faith: According to thy faith be it unto thee, and works only according to our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ability.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end of that age of trial, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the tomb,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and all not found written in their book of life, will be cast into the lake of fire--already described as representing wrath and destruction.  That the lake of fire is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">symbolic,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is readily seen, because death and the tomb are represented as going into the same--the tomb will be no more, and the Adamic death will be no more. (`Isa. 25:7,8`.) All men who are then judged unworthy of life, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but it is the second death, and is attributable to willful sin on their own part; for the Adamic death and all its results will have been destroyed.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">As the false system, or church (anti-Christ) has during this age attempted to govern the nations of the earth, so the real church--made one with the true Christ, will possess the true kingdom over earth's nations. The one, is in Scripture called &quot;that great </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">City</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (government) that reigneth over the kings of the earth,&quot; and is also called &quot;Babylon&quot;; (confusion) so the other is to be a strong </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">City</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> called Zion and The New Jerusalem (or &quot;the city of the Great King&quot;--King of kings and Lord of lords.)  &quot;God is in the midst of her, she shall not be (re-) moved.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Being the dwelling place of God-- it will be the place from which he will operate in blessing all the world; for &quot;reconciliation for iniquity&quot; having brought mankind into harmony, and having blotted out sin, it will be meet that God's power should be engaged in lifting up and blessing all --&quot;as God has spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets.&quot; (`Acts 3:21`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, God himself shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.  It was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> plan from the very first--God so loved the world that he sent Jesus: and so, of him and through him and to him are all things and we through him. (`2 Cor. 5:18`.) Not only do the past features of the plan indicate that God was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> reconciling the world to himself, (paying the ransom exacted by his own Justice,) but now we learn, that the Millennial work is still His.  He it is, who will wipe all tears, etc.  Yet, as in times past, he will use means and agencies--Christ Jesus and His Bride are to be the agencies; and as it has been all along it will still be, God in Christ and Christ in you.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How blessed the thought that we soon shall share in the wiping away of all tears from humanity.  Yet this shall be our glorious mission work during that age, for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wiping</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is a gradual work.  And the tears will last so long as their cause--imperfection, pain and death exists; and these will not be fully removed until the end of that age--Then &quot;there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.&quot;  All those evils are part of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">curse</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--results of sin; and all being redeemed by him who was made a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">curse</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for us it is proper that in due time all should have these blessings, and the curse be forever removed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;He that sat upon the throne said: Behold I make all things new.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, for this cause he became a man, then gave his human life as man's ransom price from sin.  And thus having bought him in his low estate, he by his new </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(divine)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life is to bless him with full ability to regain his lost estate, as perfect man--the image of his Creator.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He that sitteth in the heavens has already declared--a &quot;time of restitution&quot; or making new--by the mouth of all his holy prophets, and he now tells John that promise is faithful and sure--&quot;Write, these words are faithful and true.&quot; (margin.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He is the A and Z, the beginner and ender of the great salvation of mankind.  He surely will, as he has said, give to all that are ATHIRST of the water of life freely--all men who will, may come into harmony and live forever.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who are worthy of the perfect human life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are called overcomers and &quot;inherit </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">these</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> things&quot;-- the earthly kingdom, just as the overcomers of this Gospel Age are called &quot;overcomers&quot; and inherit spiritual things, and the heavenly kingdom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But those who do not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> renounce fully the works of darkness, have their part in the lake of fire and brimstone--are subjects of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> death.  This death is for their own sins, and is everlasting; will never be ended or interrupted by a resurrection.  No, Christ dieth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and there is no ransom from that tomb, as there was from the Adamic death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then--sin blotted out--sinners extinct --all things in heaven and in earth shall sing praises and thanks, to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God.</font><br />

<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This view seems to come back to our day, as its starting point.  John representing the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">living</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> members of the Bride company, is shown the Holy City (government) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">coming</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> down to earth.  But before he could see it, he had to go, in spirit, as high as possible above the earthly level. So we, the anti-type, may </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> see the kingdom of God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">coming:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the rule of the Highest commencing to direct and overthrow earthly things, preparatory to the full reception of the will of God on earth as in heaven.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;We can see his coming judgments as</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       they circle all the earth,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  The signs and groanings promised, to</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       precede the second birth,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  We read his righteous sentence in the</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       crumbling thrones of earth,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">            Jerusalem come down!&quot; But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> cannot see this kingdom as already on its way to earth--&quot;coming down.&quot;  To thus recognize it, we must get away from the world and its standpoint of view; we must go </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in spirit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (by and by in person) to the great and high mountain (kingdom of God), i.e. we must come into full sympathy and loyalty to that heavenly kingdom before sharing the King's confidence, so as to be shown its glory and power, and our future position as the Bride of the King.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">From our present standpoint, we can see what very few seem to see-- that that kingdom will be an all powerful one, a spiritual one--&quot;Having the glory (majesty and power) of God.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have here a symbolic description of this glorious government of earth.  The entire city is of pure </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gold</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--divine glory, an untarnishing glory--the glory of God.  It has &quot;walls of salvation&quot;; (`Isa. 60:18`.) protection and security abide in it. Its walls will never crumble nor fall, for the foundations are built of precious jewels, and the wall itself of Jasper, clear as crystal--(probably a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">diamond).</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The salvation walls rest securely on the finished redemption --the completed foundations as expressed by Jesus, the Apostles, and Prophets. (`Eph. 2:20`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The city lieth four square, the height, length, and breadth being equal--a cube, a perfect figure.  This is another way of showing its perfection; it is perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">toward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God, as well as toward earth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R334 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have already seen, that when God's kingdom (dominion) is established on earth, mankind will be brought into harmony with it, and the literal earthly city of Jerusalem will be rebuilt upon her old heaps, and will again become the great city of earth and Israel (the children of Abraham according to the flesh), as God promised--the channel through which a blessing will flow to all the nations of earth, from the spiritual </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--Christ. (`Gal. 3:16 and 29`; compare `Rom. 11:25-33`.)  And when we read that it has gates in every direction, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel inscribed thereon, it seems in perfect accord, to show Israel's position as channels, gateways, by which the world may approach to the heavenly government, and through which may come the blessings to mankind.  At the gates were twelve messengers (angels). This would seem to teach that Israel will in due time be the messengers to communicate the Love and Knowledge of the Lord to all creatures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">city</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had no need of the Sun (Gospel message), neither of the Moon (the Gospel reflection--&quot;The Mosaic Law&quot;) to shine in it; for it is filled with the glory of God.  Now we know in part, and see as through a smoked glass dimly; then, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall know even as we are known, being made perfect as divine beings, having the glory of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nations</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of earth will still need the symbolic also the natural) sun and moon.  In fact, it is when &quot;the books shall be opened,&quot; that the pure and full light of the Gospel and of the Law will shine out and bless mankind.  The prophet says: &quot;The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven fold (perfect) ...in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people [caused by sin] and healeth the stroke of their wound.&quot; (`Isa. 30:26`.)  But not only will the knowledge of the Lord flow out from the opened books, but the city (government--ruling) will be such as to shed light upon them.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And the nations shall walk in the light of it.&quot;  [The words--&quot;of them which are saved&quot;--are omitted from the oldest Mss.]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And the kings </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[saints,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Rev. 5:10`] shall bring the glory and honor of themselves into the city.  And they shall bring the glory and honor (the choice, bright, perfected) of the nations into the city.  Thus we see that this government will at first contain the glory of the spiritual kings of earth, and afterward as the Millennial age progresses, the kingdom will embrace or include all of earth's pure and good--but only those counted worthy of life.  Among them, will be found none defiled--for all who will, may by that time have been cleansed from all sin and defilement.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SEVENTH VIEW.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">`REV. 22:1-3,17`.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This view begins after the city (government) of God is established in earth, and illustrates its blessings under still different figures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A river of water of life is seen, and trees of life whose fruit sustains life, and whose foliage heals the people. How this calls our minds back to the Paradise from whence Adam was driven on account of sin, and to the tree of life in the midst of Eden, from which he was debarred, and from the lack of whose fruit Adam and his race died.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Oh, what a picture of the &quot;restitution of all things, which God hath spoken&quot;--the healing of all the curse, the blotting out of sin, and with it, of misery, pain, and death, because a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has been paid; and he who ransomed, is the one who gloriously restores.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The water of life which will there flow from the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">throne</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is a picture of the future; for not yet has the throne been established on the earth.  We still pray &quot;Thy kingdom come,&quot; and not until that prayer is answered, can that river of water of life flow.  The water of life is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--truth--for which mankind famishes now.  It will flow out bountifully when the tabernacle of God is with men.  Then thirsty humanity, groaning and in painful bondage to sin and death, will be refreshed and restored.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A type of humanity may be seen in the condition of Israel in the wilderness.  Thirsty, they cried to the Lord for water; the rock was smitten, and from it came forth streams in the desert.  So now mankind's prayers and groans (`Rom. 8:21,22`) have been heard of Jehovah and he has permitted the ROCK, Christ Jesus, to be smitten.  Yes, and the smiting still continues, for we are permitted to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;fill up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ.&quot; (`Col. 1:24`.)  And while </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one member</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is being smitten, it is true that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">smiting</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is still in process; but when all the sufferings of Christ (head and body) are ended, then will flow forth streams of water of life, and whosoever will may drink freely and live forever.  Typical Israel drank of the typical water from the typical rock; but the substance is of Christ and the whole world--whosoever is athirst may yet come to the river of life and drink freely. (`1 Cor. 10:4`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Knowledge of God (whom to know is life eternal) is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> possessed to a limited degree by those now begotten of the word of truth, but it is as Jesus expressed it, in such, &quot;a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">well</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of water springing up&quot;; but in the next, the Millennial Age, it will be a full, broad </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">river</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of truth and of the knowledge of the Lord.  Now confined to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">few</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;a little flock,&quot; it will then be free to all.  Then the little flock who now walk the narrow way to reach the grand prize of life --&quot;Immortality&quot;--will have reached and won the prize.  The chaste Virgin now espoused to the Son of Heaven's King, will be united to the Bridegroom--no longer the virgin, she will be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bride,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Lamb's wife and joint heir: and her future work as Bride is shown in `verse 17`-- &quot;The Spirit and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bride</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> say </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">come.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> And let him that heareth say, come. And let him that is athirst, come. And whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the present Gospel age we (a) members of the espoused </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Virgins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> may be used by the Spirit, in the work of taking </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">out</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (selecting) the one who shall shortly be the Bride, and share the Bridegroom's name and glory and work, and this is a grand privilege; but what comfort it brings to the heart of every one begotten of the Spirit of God (Love) to know that the very object of our present selection is to enable us to be in the next age co-workers together with the Bridegroom and our Father, in blessing all families of earth by causing the water to flow freely, and inviting them to drink into the knowledge and love of God and live forever.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Trees of life seem to symbolize saints, whose leaves--professions-- teachings, will heal men, and whose fruit will be adapted to the changing conditions of men as they are brought upward toward perfection--fruit suitable for each changing season, thus restoring man, to man's estate.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And there shall be no more curse&quot; --the curse will be gradually removed and man gradually released, under the blessings of that glorious age. There his servants shall serve him, and reign unto the age of ages, when the kingdom shall be delivered to God even the Father.</font><br />
