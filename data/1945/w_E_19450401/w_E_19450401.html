<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam's wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every creature's name and clothed him with ail power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD’S CAPITAL ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth&quot; of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH has never failed to meet the defiant challenge of his archenemy, Satan the Devil. Every time the bluff of the wicked challenger has been called on the issue of “Who is Almighty God? and who holds and keeps the sovereignty over the universe?” Jehovah has come off the winner, and Satan has been put to shame. Satan has been able to stage a comeback from time to time; but that has been only because of the willful perversity of some creatures and the easy tendency of imperfect men to quickly forget the issue and what God’s past triumphs have plainly demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The leading issue before all creation is the sovereignty of the universe, that is, the rightful rulership over all parts of the universe and over all creatures inhabiting those populated parts. The one-time member of Jehovah’s household, namely, the beautiful cherub Lucifer, or Heylel, raised the issue. Waxing ambitious, he challenged the position of his Father by rebelling against his authority and dominion. This was shortly after perfect man had appeared on the earth, in the paradise of Eden. Thus Heylel, or Lucifer, transformed himself into Satan, which name means “Opposer; antagonist”. This upstart Satan knew he could not carry out his scheme single-handed, but must turn others, both angels and men, into opposers like himself. Devilishly he claimed that Jehovah was not alone in his Godship, but that others could become gods like Jehovah; they should not be restrained from doing so, but had a right to develop themselves as such. He further claimed that Jehovah’s sovereignty over all the universe, including the earth, was merely nominal or in name; it was a lot of propaganda, but not a fact. Others could themselves create a world of their own, off which Jehovah could be forced to keep his hands. At present they were merely yielding submission and service to Jehovah under a misunderstanding, a sheer misapprehension on their part. But if their eyes were opened to their opportunities and they arose</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1. How has Jehovah's calling of Satan’s bluff always resulted? but why has Satan been able to stage a comeback ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2s What is the leadins *ssue before all creation ’ and how did Satan come into existence, and with what reasoning respecting the issue?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>LE SHOWDOWN</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God battles.&quot;—2 Chron. 32:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to the privileges of asserting and developing themselves, then such creatures would quit the universal organization of Jehovah. They would take themselves out from under his questionable universal sovereignty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ On such wise Satan challenged the universal domination of Jehovah God, and also deceived, lured and persuaded many angelic and human creatures to his side of the issue. As respects those who stood out for right principle rather than for selfishness, Satan proposed and boasted that he w’ould force or coerce them to his side. For Almighty God Jehovah instantly to wipe out Satan and his dupes would not have settled the issue before all intelligent creation. The deciding of a controversy that rested on such fine points of dispute required that time be granted and the challenger and his backers be permitted to have full and fair opportunity to prove their charges and their boasts. That is why the Omnipotent Jehovah did not at once put down the rebellion and prevent the spread of diabolical wickedness. That is why he has permitted Satan the Devil to keep on living, thus allowing angels and men to choose the deity they will serve, Jehovah God or Satan the Devil. This test on the issue needs not to go on forever. Sometime the raging controversy must come to a showdown and everlasting settlement, for the eternal peace and unity of the universe. And it is Jehovah God, because he is most high and all-powerful and actually sovereign everywhere, it is He, and not the mimic god Satan the rebellious challenger, that sets the time limit to the test.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah God meets the enemy’s challenge with a counter-challenge. This he does by putting in the field willing servants of His whom he arms with his divine Word. These then call the bluffing enemy and they dispute the enemy’s claims and expose the falsity of such. During the time that God has permitted the enemy the chance to produce arguments</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4 How does Jehovah meet the enemy’s challenge? and what doe* he do when the time runs out? </span><span class="font5">and proof in support, he has raised up such challengers of Satan the Devil and that one’s wicked host. When the time runs out, Jehovah will vindicate his courageous defiers of the enemy by settling the grand dispute in his own favor and thus vindicating his own name as Almighty God and Universal Sovereign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> How God will do this in sight of the coming postwar world, Jehovah gave examples from time to time in days of old. One of such convincing examples, with all the features of challenge, counter-challenge, and showdown, he gave in the midst of the reign of faithful Hezekiah, king of Jerusalem. God did not let this come down to us as an unwritten tradition of men. He caused the facts of the case to be recorded and to be preserved against all efforts of the defeated contenders in the controversy to destroy it. In behalf of his willing servants who take up the counter-challenge, Jehovah caused three written records of witness to be provided, one at 2 Chronicles 32:1-23; another at 2 Kings 18:13-37; 19:1-37; and another at Isaiah 36:1-22; 37:1-38. Isaiah’s record is almost a word-for-word repeating of that in 2 Kings. And as we are all unpreventably tied in with the issue, standing either to win or to lose personally by the approaching settlement of the is-* sue, we here run through a brief consideration of this threefold record. It is urgently important to do so, because “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONTENDING PARTIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The dramatic event of old takes on a prophetic meaning as it finds its counterpart in the affairs of this hectic epoch that began A.D. 1914. One of the actors on the ancient stage was a world power, with roots of great antiquity. In the first book of the Bible, namely, at Genesis 2: 10-14, it is stated that a river went out of the garden of Eden and divided outside into four branch-rivers, the second one of which is ‘that which compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia’; and the third is “it which goeth toward the east of Assyria”; and “the fourth river is Euphrates”, where the city and tower of Babel, or Babylon, were built not long after the Flood. Nimrod the mighty hunter, who set himself up as the stategod for worship, was the first king of Babel, or Babylon. Forth from his territories he went prosperously as an aggressor and built Nineveh on the banks of the Tigris, the above-mentioned “third river”. Nineveh thus lay near what are the presentday Mosul oilfields. (Gen. 10: 8-12) This is the Nineveh, in Assyria, to which the prophet Jonah preached to repent because of its great wickedness. (Jonah</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">B. How and why baa Jehovah given ua a convincing example of the fore-fiolng In connection with Hezekiah? and why U It Important to consider t here?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">u What Ie the Bible record of the origins of Assyria, Its location, and its religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1-4; Matt. 12:39-41) The facts are that Assyria, of which Nineveh at last became the capital, was run by an authoritarian government under the control of Jehovah’s great challenger, Satan the Devil, and his demons. Satan was there worshiped under the form of the idol-image called “Nisroch”, which name, as far as the Jews could make it out, meant “great eagle”. Because of Nimrod’s pioneer activities Assyria was also called “the land of Nimrod”.-Mic. 5:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>T</sup>The kingdom of Judah, over which Hezekiah reigned at Jerusalem, lay in between Egypt on the south and Assyria on the north. For such reason the two world powers, Egypt and Assyria, became representatives of what the Bible calls “the king of the south” and “the king of the north”. The kingdom of Judah was only a small kingdom, ruling just a few million Israelites, that is, just three tribes out of the twelve tribes of Israel, namely, Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, together with a multitude of non-Israelite “strangers” within their city gates. At King Solomon's death the other tribes of Israel had broken away from allegiance to Jerusalem and had formed a separate kingdom, the so-called “kingdom of Israel”, of which the city of Samaria became the capital in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ This latter kingdom of Israel quickly turned aside from the worship of Jehovah. It gave itself over to religion,’ starting out with two golden calves for worship and descending into worse forms of religion until the religion of the fiery Baal-worship was reached. The kingdom of Israel, therefore, forfeited the protection of the Universal Sovereign; and in the seventh year of Hezekiah’s reign he looked across the border to behold the religious capital Samaria razed to the ground by the Assyrian conqueror, Sargon, and the surviving Israelites dragged off into exile in the northern territories of Assyria. King Hezekiah saw the meaning of this; he took close to heart the truth there illustrated, namely, that the abandonment of the worship of Jehovah God and the adoption of religion are fatal and lead to ruin and destruction. That is the truth which Vatican City and the other states of postwar “Christendom” will be forced to learn and to admit at the coming battle of Armageddon. There the paramount issue of universal domination will be decided against them by a disaster like that of Israel of old.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The question arose before Hezekiah, Would Jerusalem and Judah suffer a fate like Israel’s, and that at the hand of the king of Assyria! Let religion’s “crusaders” of today take note that the determination of this crucial question hung upon the point of</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">7. Where was the kingdom of Judab located, and bow did this kingdom come about?</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">9. Wbat question therefore arose before Hezekiab? and how did be early proceed to answer it? </span><span class="font5">worship. Hence, when Hezekiah, in the first year of his reign, reopened the doors of Jehovah’s temple and then led the kingdom in a concerted drive against religion to destroy it from the land, did he decide the question right! The Bible record, as it unfolds before us, gives a straight answer, to guide and admonish us as we near the postwar period. —See the two previous issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> In the next month after reopening and cleansing God’s temple at Jerusalem, the kingdom of Judah celebrated the restoration of His worship by keeping the passover and the feast of unleavened bread at the holy city. Then all the celebrators, fired with zeal for the name of Jehovah, went forth and broke up and destroyed all the symbols, idols, groves, altars, and canonized high places of religion, regardless of what cult. Then King Hezekiah carried forward his reconstructive work by putting the worship of Jehovah on a well-organized basis. He saw to it that the priests and their servants the Levites were appointed to their respective courses of service, according to the Theocratic law of the Lord God. He made his own material contributions to support them in their whole-time work at the temple and in educating the people in the word and the commandments of Jehovah. He reminded the people also of their responsibilities to contribute toward the temple support.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> With such a faithful example before them, as set by the king, the people of the kingdom of Judah brought their tithes to the temple storehouse. For about five months they kept on piling up their tithe contributions. There was such willing giving by Jehovah’s worshipers that the priests and the Levites and their menial servants, the Nethinim, had more than enough. The superabundance must not be wasted or let spoil; so Hezekiah arranged to build more storechambers at the temple. He then appointed Levites to act as storekeepers to distribute the supplies to the temple workers and their dependents as the need came due. Thus the temple workers would not be obliged to hunt jobs outside, but could apply themselves to their duties with the least concern for the material things of life. The inspired comment upon such reconstructive efforts of the king is written in these words: “And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the Lord his God. And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.”—2 Chron. 31:20,21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” The facts, set out in the previous issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 What action for pure worship was taken by king and people? and how did Hezekiah carry forward his reconstructive work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">11. How did the people respond to Hezekiah’s exhortation? what arrangements did he then make? and how does the Bible comment on bls reconstructive efforts?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">12. When ano how was a like reconstruction work set In motion? and to what factors has its progress been due?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> plainly indicate that Hezekiah was a prophetic figure or type of Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus, after his enthronement A.D. 1914. When Christ Jesus came to the great spiritual temple in 1918, Jehovah’s witnesses on earth were lying low under the oppressions and persecutions of religious forces. Hence he forthwith set in motion the reconstruction work, which continues till this day. In consequence of the world-wide witness that has been given publicly and from house to house throughout the nations it has become known to them all that Jehovah’s worship is a real thing in the earth and that Jehovah has a consecrated people on earth who are separate from all religion. The noteworthy progress of the witness work since 1918 is not due to Jehovah’s witnesses. They are comparatively few, like the kingdom of Judah amid the mighty heathen nations of old. The progress is due to Jehovah’s anointed King. His kingdom is at hand, and he has “wrought that which was good and right and truth before the Lord his God” and in behalf of his devoted followers on the earth. He has led them “in the service of the house of God” and in seeking the true God according to His law and commandments, and not according to religion. He has done this with all his heart. Therefore Jehovah has prospered him; all this with benefit to his faithful remnant and their companions upon the earth. The interests of God’s capital organization Zion, that is to say, the Kingdom, have been built up and advanced among them, and have prospered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>IS</sup> Such reconstructive efforts and activities in behalf of the worship of Jehovah God were a decided setback for demonism or religion. As in the days of Judge Jephthah, who pushed the demon-worshiping Ammonites out of the land of Israel, it was a recovery of ground for Theocratic worship and service, ground that had for a long time been lost to the forces of religion. (Judges, chapter 11) King Hezekiah’s anti-religious measures could not do other than stir up bitter antagonism on the part of Satan and the demon hosts. For the time being their grip on the kingdom of Judah had been broken. They had been foiled in their endeavors to prove that God could not set up a government over earth that could not be corrupted and turned away from Theocratic rule. The kingdom of Judah stood as the sole remaining beacon of Theocratic government on earth, and under King Hezekiah it was gleaming brilliantly in favor of Jehovah’s side of the burning issue of universal domination. Jehovah was reigning on Mount Zion, at Jerusalem, as represented by the anointed king who sat on the throne of Jehovah. Satan the Devil and his hosts felt mocked by the reinvigorated typical Theocracy and its worship of Jehovah at </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">13. Who were moved to bitter antagonism by such anti-religiouB measure*, and why so. in the larger view of such matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His holy temple, and began maneuvering their world powers so as to destroy Jehovah’s Theocratic organization from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> The evidence is plain that Satan, “the prince of the demons,” purposed to put King Hezekiah in fear and to make him compromise with the Devil’s organization. Or, failing in this, Satan the Devil would then overwhelm and crush Hezekiah’s kingdom. He had forced Hezekiah’s predecessor into a compromise and an unclean spiritual adultery with this world. He had also wiped out the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel immediately north of Judah. All this the Devil did by the use of the power and might of Assyria. The king of Assyria was yet his best bet in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">14. What lines of action was Satan therefore provoked to take, and by the use of what earthly agent? </span><span class="font5">the game of power politics. Hence the Devil favored the new king of Assyria, Sennacherib, in his course of military aggression for global dictatorship. Sennacherib’s name means “the moon adds (or increases) brothers”, denoting that he was a favorite of the demon moon-god. He was, however, a worshiper of the demon god “Nisroch”, and hence was a good agent for the demon powers to use against Jehovah’s worship. With this, the strongest earthly means at his disposal, Satan the Devil was provoked to action against Jehovah’s typical Theocracy on the earth. The inspired Bible record clearly shows this, and describes how Satan used his visible earthly tools to try to put down Jehovah’s counter-challenge. For details see the next article.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>JEHOVAH’S UNIVERSAL SOVEREIGNTY VINDICATED</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">C</span><span class="font5">HRIST Jesus is the Greater Hezekiah; that is, he is the reigning King foreshadowed by Hezekiah but greater than Hezekiah. King Hezekiah’s aggressive opponent, Sennacherib, pictured Satan the Devil, whom Sennacherib worshiped and served in the interest of Satan’s world domination. When Christ Jesus the King came to the temple in 1918 and judged the “house of God” and produced a faithful remnant therefrom and revived Jehovah’s worship and service among them, Satan the Devil was enraged, even more so than in the days of Hezekiah. The great witness to Jehovah’s name and kingdom which the King Christ Jesus set going through the remnant of Jehovah's witnesses on earth was a challenge, because it called attention to Jehovah’s sovereignty. It advertised The Theocratic Government, which He had set up with Christ Jesus on the throne. Satan the Devil had been worsted in the “war in heaven” and had been cast out therefrom for ever. Hence he has had great wrath, because of being restrained to the earth, and the more so because he knows that the showdown battle of Armageddon must yet be fought and he has but a short time to prepare for it. Being unable to accomplish anything further with respect to the heavens where Jehovah’s anointed King reigns, Satan is grimly determined to hold the earth as his domain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ At the earth Satan is determined to stamp out all rebellion against his rule, and this he must do by totalitarian-state rule and by an increasing regimentation of the people. The fact that there is a Theocratic government, and that it is Jehovah’s government by Christ and is higher than Satan’s world organization, must be strictly kept out of the news, and the people must be kept ignorant of the Kingdom gospel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Whom do King Hezekiah and King Sennacherib respectively picture ’ and why does the latter have great vtrath at present?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2. What is now Satan's determination respecting the earth and its peoples and their worship?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">No worship, except religion, which is demonism, must be permitted on earth. The revival of Jehovah’s worship, which is true Christianity, must be stopped and blotted out. But how! By tactics such as Satan used in King Hezekiah’s time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ The record, at 2 Chronicles 32:1-8, reads: “After these things, and this faithfulness [on Hezekiah’s part], Sennacherib Idng of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself. And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters, of the fountains which were without the city’; and they’ helped him. So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water? And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall without, and strengthened Millo in the city of David [the citadel inside Jerusalem], and made weapons and shields in abundance. And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him: with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4. Whom do the horde® nf Assyria picture, and a hat are the parts nnd feature® thereof?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Sennacherib pictured political powers under Satan, “the god of this world,” and which political powers make up and form “the king of the north”. “The king of the north” is used in Bible prophecy to picture those political powers which use totalitarian rule and which exalt the earthly ruling powers above God and command man’s absolute obedience to such rulers as being supposedly &quot;the higher powers”. Thereby the people are regimented into a religious worship of the state and they exist only for the religiouspolitical state. The facts well known show unmistakably that the totalitarian “king of the north” combine includes the Nazi-Fascist states, including the political state of Vatican City with its pope. The religious-political pope is the most totalitarian ruler of all on earth. Hence he favors dictatorships and authoritarian rule of the people by rulers of the Roman Catholic sect, like Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Petain, Ti&gt;o. etc., or by political dictators with whom he can anange a concordat. The fact that Shintoist Japan is not even professedly “Christian” does not prevent the pope from having diplomatic representatives exchanged between the Vatican and the mikado after the outrageous Pearl Harbor attack. Such spiritual whoredom and harlotry of religion with political totalitarian powers was well foreshadowed by Nineveh, which Sennacherib made his capital city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ Concerning Nineveh the prophet Nahum forewarned, saying: <sup>-c</sup>\Voe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not; . . . there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nation* through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord [Jehovah] of hosts.”—Nah. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christ Jesus the King foreknew our day. He foretold that the modern totalitarian religiouspolitical powers, like Assyria of old, would seek to overrun the entire globe. The real objective of this would be to wipe out Jehovah’s witnesses and to cut them off from the waters of truth flowing from the throne of the kingdom of God. This would prevent Jehovah’s King and the “bride” from saying, “Come!” It would also forestall the “strangers” of good-will who heard the invitation from likewise saying, ‘Come: and let him that is athirst say, Come; and whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.’ (Rev. 22:17) Hence Christ Jesus the King made sure the supply of the water of Kingdom truth for his faithful remnant of spiritual Judeans and their companions of good-will. Hezekiah’s ancient work of providing water supplies for Zion or Jerusalem was commented upon even in the apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus in these words: “Ezechias fortified his city and brought in water into the midst thereof: and he digged a rock with iron and made a well for water.” (Ecclus. 48:19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font5"> But the inspired Record says of Hezekiah: “This same Hezekiah also stopped [concealed] the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it [by tunnel] straight down to the west side of the city of David [or Zion].” (2 Chron. 32: 30) Thus Hezekiah provided steadfast water supplies for his subjects during any length of siege by enemies. At the same time he barred the enemies from any access to it, to contaminate it or to seize it for their own advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’Likewise, Christ Jesus entrusted to the remnant of the children of Zion, the “faithful and wise servant” class on earth, all his Kingdom interests or “goods”, and he makes sure that they shall always be supplied with the truth and the privilege of spreading it to other thirsty ones. At the same time he withholds the precious Kingdom truths and service from the enemies, particularly the religious clergy, and they are unable to stop up the waters from flowing to those who seek Jehovah and his capital organization Zion and refreshing them. As it is written, at Psalm 46:4, 5: “There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.” Therefore, let all peoples know that they will never get the waters of truth at the hands of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy or any other religious clergy. The water of truth is supplied only at Jehovah’s capital organization Zion, where His anointed King reigns, inviting all thirsty ones to come and be made glad with his people. In harmony with this, Christ Jesus the-King caused factories to be built, owned and operated by Jehovah’s witnesses for the exclusive purpose of providing the Kingdom truth in printed and recorded form, that the refreshing Kingdom message might be spread in many languages to all the thirsty peoples of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ Christ Jesus has also armed and equipped his faithful remnant and their companions with the whole “armour of God”, the spiritual armament of truth, which none of the enemy can pierce. He has built up the visible part of his organization, strengthening it and bringing his followers together in unbreakable solidarity and unity, and thus making the organization assault-proof against the totalitarian enemies. He has trained his followers for the war-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">7 . To correspond with that, what has the Kina Christ Jesus done, thereby making true Psalm 40:4,6?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8 How has Christ Jesus, like Hezekiah, equipped, trained, and fortified bis followers? and how do these rest upon the words of the Grentei King Hezekiah? </span><span class="font5">fare against religion and against encroachments by religion’s political allies; and he comforts and strengthens them with the promises of God’s Word. The remnant and their companions are relatively few in number, but they are not fearful of the modern Assyrian, Satan the Devil, nor of his totalitarian religious-political hordes. Continually they rest themselves or lean upon their King’s words, saying: “There [are] more with us than with him: with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord [Jehovah] our God to help us, and to fight our battles.” Already, down to this year 1945, Jehovah God has fought many battles for them and has maintained for them the ‘freedom wherewith Christ has made them free’. They look forward calmly and confidently to the fast-approaching battle of Armageddon, knowing that the same unconquerable God shall fight that battle for them too, because the battle is not theirs, but God’s. Note now how the Bible record gives basis for such confidence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FLOOD OF TOTALITARIAN HOSTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ The ancient record helps us to understand what has taken place in recent years due to the rise of the Nazi and Fascist totalitarian powers and Catholic Action. The ostensible purpose of such political and religious-action groups was to destroy all democratic government and to take away from the people all their liberties, particularly as to publishing the truth and worshiping the only true and living God. Now remember how, in ancient time, the little kingdom of Judah, composed of Jehovah’s witnesses, was flanked on the south by Egypt, the kingdom of the Pharaohs. Egypt was a continual foe to the rising power of Assyria, and is spoken of in Bible prophecy as “the king of the south”. As such, Egypt pictured the present-day political opponent of the totalitarian Nazi-Fascist-religious powers, namely, the liberal democratic powers, who profess to be the champions of the people’s liberties and natural rights. During World War I, as well as during this present global war, Egypt is the political ally of the democratic powers, notably the British Commonwealth and America. The strategy of the totalitarian attackers of the people’s democratic rights and liberties today was nicely indicated in advance for us by the maneuvers of the ancient Sennacherib of Assyria, “the king of the north.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Turning to the record, at 2 Kings 18:13-16, we read: “Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">9. (a) What wax the purpose of the Nazi and Fascist totalitarian powers and Catholic Action! (b) What country was the continual foe of the rlsins power of Assyria, where was it located relative to Judah, and what did it picture as to the present-day political setup!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10. In the fourteenth year of his reign, what seeming compromise did Hezekiah make with Sennacherib? and what did Chis certainly not picture? </span><span class="font5">Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king’s house. At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.” God’s Word does not reproach Hezekiah for this course of conduct; and it is therefore not for us to criticize this seeming compromise with the then dominant part of Satan’s organization. One thing is certain: it did not picture any compromise by Christ Jesus with the antitypical Sennacherib, Satan the DeviL Evidently Jehovah permitted this to foreshadow something of modern history; and into this we now inquire.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Having safeguarded his rear by neutralizing the provinces of Babylon and of Media, King Sennacherib moved southward as an overflowing flood. The Bible indicates that he by-passed the stronghold of Zion or Jerusalem, for we hear of him and “all his power” as encamped before the city of Lachish. The account at Isaiah 10:28-32 dramatically describes the approach of Sennacherib toward Jerusalem and getting as near to it as the place called Nob, which was in sight of Jerusalem. But instead of making a frontal assault upon the holy city, Isaiah’s account says, “as yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.” Lachish lay about thirty miles to the southwest of Jerusalem. It belonged to the kingdom of Judah and was strongly fortified. Sennacherib’s evident strategy was to cut off “the king of the south”, that is, Egypt, from coming to the help of Jerusalem should King Hezekiah give up his.faith in Jehovah God and appeal to Egypt for aid. History records that Sennacherib administered a telling defeat to the Egyptian hosts. Thus he thought to protect his southern flank. Egypt, the greatest threat to him, must first be eliminated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Then, by further attacking and trying to neutralize the outer “hedgehogs” or strongholds of the kingdom of Judah, Sennacherib would move in from the circumference to the center at Jerusalem. Thus, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font5"> thought, Jerusalem would be hopelessly trapped and surrounded and cut off from all outside help, a military fig ripe and ready for his plucking. He did not reckon that complete aid and deliverance could come from above, yes, from a source of help higher than the stratosphere in which the latest airplanes maneuver.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IL Io moving southward what attention did Sennacherib give to Jerusalem? and why did he encamp at Lachish?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">12 . How did Sennacherib think to hopelessly trap Jerusalem, but upon what tact did ho not reckon as to her aid?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Sennacherib’s military’ maneuver agrees with the tactics of the Nazi-Fascist-Vatican crowd of recent years. Let it be remembered that ancient Egypt, or “the king of the south”, pictured the liberal, progressive, democratic world-powers of today, particularly Britain and America, the bulwarks of constitutional law and government. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her totalitarian political partners know that in the lands of the present-day “king of the south” the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses have been most free and the proclamation of the Kingdom message has been greatest. This is true because such liberal, democratic lands recognize certain fundamental God-given rights and privileges of each individual human creature, and provide in their constitutions and laws for the protection of such precious things. Thus the liberal, freedomloving governments have appeared to be a thing of advantage to the modern Judeans, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses under the reigning King Christ Jesus. However, the advantage has not been all onesided, and the benefit has not been in only one direction. The record which Jehovah’s witnesses have made in the courts of the land, particularly in America, during the years 1933 to 1945 shows this. In what way? In that Jehovah’s witnesses have been the greatest champions and fighters on the home front for those civil liberties, rights and immunities which democratic countries hold most dear. And why has this been so? Because of the fight of Jehovah’s witnesses under their King Christ Jesus against the modern Assyrian’s aggressions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*<sup>4</sup> The antitypical Sennacherib, Satan the Devil, realizing what democratic freedoms mean, has moved his totalitarian forces against the democratic powers, that is, against “the king of the south” as foreshadowed by Egypt. This has been done not merely by military aggressions. By means of Roman Catholic clergy and Catholic Action groups acting as “fifth columnists” planted inside the democratic countries in strategic places, Satan has even tried to overturn democratic constitutional government from within, using these agents from within to co-operate with the totalitarian military aggressors. Satan’s chief aim in all this has been to get Jehovah’s witnesses and to wipe out Jehovah’s worship for ever. Having been cast out of heaven by the Chief One of Zion, namely, Christ Jesus, Satan then persecutes such other children of Zion, Christ’s faithful bodymembers who bear witness to Jehovah’s name and kingdom. Hence, like a dragon, Satan and his demon organization have disgorged upon the earth a titanic flood of modern-Assyri an armies, all bent upon</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">13 . As respects Jehovah’s witnesses, why have the Naxi-Faadst-Vatlcan crowd moved recently agninat the democratic powers? and why has the advantage not been all one-sided?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">14 How has Satan covertly moved his forces against “the king of the south<sup>0</sup>? and what has his organisation disgorged upon the earth? </span><span class="font5">wrecking democratic institutions and denying their benefits to freedom-loving peoples and thus making it easy and simple for the totalitarians to crush Jehovah’s faithful remnant and their companions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> By court actions, and by fearlessly standing in defense of their Christian existence, and by steadfastly keeping on in the exercise of their God-given rights and duties, it has been necessary for these announcers of Jehovah’s Righteous Government to carry on a continual fight against the aggressions of the antitypical Assyrian, Satan, and his flood of totalitarian religious-political hordes. Owing to the courage of Jehovah’s witnesses, the democratic “earth” has taken heart to likewise offer resistance and thus to swallow up and absorb the onrush of the totalitarian flood unloosed by Satan the Dragon. This was foretold, by Christ Jesus, at Revelation 12:13-17. And this diabolical maneuver was what Sennacherib’s by-passing Jerusalem and striking southward against Egypt pictured. This maneuver was carried out in an attempt to forestall any coming of the democratic institutions to the aid of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> During all this war of attrition against Jehovah’s witnesses, waged, as Daniel 7:25 words it, to “wear out the saints of the most High”, they have been under siege and assault. They have suffered much in their bodies or persons, and have been put to much expense by defending their God-given, constitutionally guaranteed rights in the courts and by repairing the damages done by the enemies. They have been and still are a great offense to the modern-Assyrian power, and only by the foregoing costly, painful course have they been able to hold him off and keep their freedom. This, then, is evidently what is pictured by Hezekiah’s saying he had offended against the king of Assyria and then offering to pay costs to hold the enemy off. And this invasion of the rights and Theocratic territory of these modern Judeans, Jehovah’s witnesses, is evidently what was pictured by Jehovah’s letting the land of Judah be invaded by King Sennacherib’s hosts and the outlying cities of Judah be assaulted and besieged. The action of the ancient Assyrians was directly against the border fortresses of Judah first. It was nonetheless a threat against Jerusalem, the capital of the typical Theocracy, and gave promise of future direct action against that royal city. Likewise, the modern Assyrians of religious-political totalitarian rule, in committing their depredations against Jehovah’s witnesses on earth, have really been offending against Jehovah’s capital organization Zion, and against Zion’s King, Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">16. How was such totalitarian onrush met. as foretold at Revelation 12:13-17? and bow doea all this match Sennacherib's maneuver?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">16. (a&gt; What, then, was pictured by Hezekiah's offending against Sen nacberib and paying costs? (b) Against what ^ere Sennacherib's movements a threat, and what does this picture?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BOASTFUL REPROACHES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” The Sacred Record now makes it very plain that Sennacherib’s military campaign against the typical Theocracy of Judah was a clever maneuver by Satan the prince of demons to bring reproach upon Jehovah God. It was to put Jehovah’s universal sovereignty in doubt before angels, demons and men. There is no record that Sennacherib, when encamped before Lachish, ever took this Judean stronghold. As long as it held out against him, that was, of course, favorable to Jerusalem. Hence what Satan’s Assyrian king could not accomplish against Jerusalem by force of arms he now purposed to accomplish by bluff and by belittling and reproaching Jehovah God, the real hidden strength of Jerusalem. Satan knew that if he could destroy Hezekiah’s faith in Jehovah and could crack his integrity toward the Most High, then Sennacherib could easily take Jerusalem, to the world-wide reproach of Jehovah God. What Satan now inspired his chief representative to do next is set out in the Record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> &quot;And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> Or, as a modernized version translates the Hebrew record: “Then the king of Assyria sent the commander-in-chief, and the chief of the eunuchs and the field marshal from Lachish with a large army against King Hezekiah at Jerusalem.” (2 Ki. 18:17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Smith-Goodspeed)</span><span class="font5"> The field marshal’s title, “Rab-shakeh,” literally means “chief cupbearer”, and there is reason to believe he was a renegade Jew. Sennacherib, who himself represented Satan the Devil, had these three prominent officials act directly for him against Jerusalem. This fact matches well the other fact, that in Satan’s visible organization he uses the three elements, (1) selfish commercialism with its military forces, and (2) politics, and (3) religion, including renegade “Christendom”, against Jehovah's Theocracy and its witnesses on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Taking a position by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the laundrymen's field, those three commanders of Satan’s hosts called for King Hezekiah. Rabshakeh acts as spokesman for the three. He speaks, not in Assyrian, but in Hebrew, purposely, that everybody on Jerusalem’s walls may hear and understand his boastings and reproaches against her God. He shouts: “Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest! Thou sayest (but they are but vain words), There is counsel and strength for the war.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">17 What w&amp;s the real purpose of Sennacherib's campaign against Judah? and bow did he scheme to take Jerusalem?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">18 . Whom did Sennacherib send directly to Jerusalem, and with what fact does his use of such agree?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">19 In what tongue does Rabshakeh shout out, and what does he say? </span><span class="font5">Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me! Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man. lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him. But if ye say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem! Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges [make a wager] to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen! Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it! Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.”—2 Ki. 18:17-25, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> As we in our modern setting listen to Rab-shakeh’s words, we hear as it were the voices and propaganda of the modern religious-political totalitarian rulers, betraying unmistakably that they represent and speak for their “great king”, the &quot;god of this world”, Satan the Devil. They are aware of the vigorous fight which Jehovah’s witnesses still wage for the preservation of the rights and freedoms which are cherished by the honest people of genuine democratic spirit. Satan’s mouthpieces warn Jehovah’s witnesses that they should not trust that these democratic rights and liberties will always be guaranteed and available for them in their witness work; but that democracy will fail them, just as Egypt, “the king of the south,” failed the Israelites of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses answer that they are fighting for God-given rights and freedom, and that they fear, obey and trust in the great King of Eternity, Jehovah. Then they hear the modern Rabshakeh say they have no reason to trust in Jehovah God because, like King Hezekiah of old, they have engaged in anti-religious activities, even against the so-called &quot;Christian religion” and its pope and other clergymen. The “Rab-shakeh” of today shouts out that the religious clergy and its political-military allies represent the Lord God. The collaboration of the clergy, the Roman Catholic clergy in particular, with the Nazi-Fascist-Japanese totalitarian powers gives undeniable evidence that they believe such powers are fighting God’s war. Hence they boast that the action they have taken in their lands against Jehovah’s witnesses is because God has said: “Go up against this land, and destroy it.” Exactly as Dictator Hitler said before dissolving Jehovah’s witnesses in Ger-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20. Id Rabshakeh's words what do we hear today? and what warning i&lt; therein given to us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">21. What do Jehovah's witnesses reply? and what does the modem Rabshakeh say In answer, as backed up by deeds? </span><span class="font5">many at the insistence of the Roman Catholic episcopate, “I consider them quacks; I do not tolerate that the German Catholics be besmirched in such a manner by this American ‘Judge’ Rutherford; I dissolve the ‘Earnest Bible Students’ in Germany; their property I dedicate to the people’s welfare; I will have all their literature confiscated’.”—Quoted from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The German Way,</span><span class="font5"> May 29, 1938; see Appendix of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">** Like the Jews on Jerusalem’s ramparts, so Jehovah’s witnesses of today obey their Greater Hezekiah, Christ Jesus, and refuse to answer the enemy’s demand for a compromise with religion and its partners. They know that what the religious-political totalitarian forces have done in desolating much of the earth and wrecking democratic institutions and liberties has been done by the aid of the demons under Satan. But it is because such things are not Theocratic and do not have Jehovah’s protection. No thought of surrender enters their mind as they hear the modern Rabshakeh boast against Jehovah and his Greater Hezekiah, saying: “Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand: neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olivetrees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria! . . . Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?”—2 Ki. 18:19-36, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Jehovah’s witnesses are not frightened. But they are grieved at all the reproach heaped upon Jehovah’s name and cause, just as Hezekiah’s three servants and Hezekiah himself were grieved so long ago. They turn to Jehovah’s prophetic word, including Isaiah’s prophecy, just as Hezekiah turned to the prophet Isaiah with this request: “It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">22. What do Jehovah’s witnesses xefuse to do or even think of? and what do they hear Rabshakeh say at this?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">23. Why are they grieved? to what do they turn? and what reply do they get?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.” (2 Ki. 19:1-6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> In reply they get from Jehovah’s Greater Prophet, Christ Jesus, the strengthening message of God’s Word. It tells them not to fear the threats and propaganda of the Devil’s hosts blaspheming Jehovah God, because in due time Almighty God will beat off Satan’s hosts and destroy even Satan himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">POSTWAR EFFORTS AND DEFEAT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">** In his efforts hitherto Satan the Devil has failed to shatter the integrity of Jehovah’s witnesses and their organized unity in God’s service. Henceforth he will play the game of Sennacherib and will renew his efforts in postwar times until the final showdown. Therefore let Jehovah’s witnesses not be deceived by any seeming retirement of the enemy hosts for a while and a seeming stoppage of their aggressions. Failing to frighten Hezekiah into surrender, “Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.” That meant that Sennacherib had moved closer to Jerusalem, Libnah being nearer than Lachish. Jerusalem’s peril had increased. But now “the king of the south”, as represented by Egypt’s neighbor, Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, put in a threatening appearance. Just so, too, the democratic ruling powers have risen in their might in this global war and threaten the future of totalitarian rule in postwar times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Under those circumstances Sennacherib sent messengers to deliver this written message to Zion’s king, Hezekiah, lest he expect any help from “the king of the south”, saying: “Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?” (2 Ki. 19:8-13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> This sums up well the final challenge of Satan the Devil against the universal sovereignty of Jehovah, and especially Jehovah’s rule by Christ Jesus in his capital organization pictured by ancient Jerusalem. Satan the Devil is certain to deliver this challenge by the messages, decrees and arrangements of the after-war “abomination of desolation”. (Matt. 24:15) This desolating abomination is the Devil’s scheme for making unnecessary Jehovah’s rule of the earth. It is to be set up to provide a manmade substitute for Jehovah’s kingdom in the form of a revived League of Nations, a postwar association of nations for peace, security and global rule.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">24. (•&gt; By what future strategy should Jehovah's witnesses not be de ceived? (b) now did Jerusalem's peril next increase, and what did King Tirhakab’s appearing picture?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">25 What messare did Sennacherib then send to Jerusalem’ and how will Satan cause a like final message to be delivered In time to come’ </span><span class="font5">Such an organization for international collaboration, blessed by the religious clergy, will be at war with Zion, Jehovah’s capital organization, because it presumes to take the “holy place” that God’s kingdom must occupy over earth.—Mark 13:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses need none of Satan’s messengers to remind them that they should not expect deliverance from “the king of the south” by any revival of democratic principles. God’s witnesses know that the hope of all the peoples lies not in human political systems, but in Jehovah God. Under the terrific threatening pressure to which the modern Assyrian and his visible hosts will yet subject them they will follow the course of Hezekiah. They will spread the matter before Jehovah at his temple and appeal to Him to save them. Why! “That all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Jehovah art God alone.” (2 Ki. 19:14-19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.) </span><span class="font5">That means, in order that Jehovah’s universal sovereignty might be vindicated before all creation!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> Isaiah the prophet came forward with Jehovah’s word in answer to Hezekiah’s prayer. He showed that the issue, botli then and now also today, is between Jehovah and Satan. Jehovah’s word through Isaiah heaps scorn upon Satan and his organization, saying: “The virgin daughter of Zion [God’s kingdom by Christ] hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn [as Jehovah himself does] : the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed! . . . even against the Holy One of Israel.” Then showing that in God’s kingdom alone is safety, Isaiah added: “And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall perform this.”—2 Ki. 19:20-31, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Yes, at the coming battle of Armageddon Jehovah God will preserve his heavenly King and kingdom. In token of that fact he will carry His faithful remnant and their companions of good-will through the final universal war. In assurance of that, Isaiah was caused to say to Satan’s hosts these words: “Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it. By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah. For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s [my King’s] sake.” (2 Ki. 19: 32-34, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> This again reminds </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2G. From whom do we know future help to be in rain? and under the pressure then how will Jehovah's witnesses take a course like King Hexekiab’s?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">27 With what answer to Hezekiah’s prayer did Isaiah come forward? 28. What doea that message mean to us today? and what was Isaiah caused to say finally concerning Sennacherib's operations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses that the battle is not theirs, but is Jehovah’s, at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Sennacherib and his main army were encamped that night before Libnah, about 25 miles southwest of Jerusalem. It is reasonable that his messengers, having received Hezekiah’s defiant message bolstered up by Isaiah’s prophecy, hastened back with their horses and chariots and reached King Sennacherib and delivered him the answer before nightfall. Whether what military forces those messengers brought along and showed off encamped before Jerusalem that night is not recorded. But whether that night or a later night, at any rate the issue was fresh in Sennacherib’s mind, and he knew that what developments immediately followed would be a settlement of the issue as to Jehovah’s capital, Zion. Night fell, with Sennacherib chagrined at the joint answer from King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah. Sennacherib’s boastfully inscribed monuments do not tell what then took place, but the Bible says: “Now that night the angel of the Lord [Jehovah] went forth and slew in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when men rose early next morning, they were all dead bodies.” What a “strange act”! It was Jehovah’s act decisively answering Satan on the issue of universal domination. Thus it was that, when Sennacherib rose or was awakened early from his sleep at Libnah, he looked forth upon the desolation that Almighty God Jehovah had wrought upon the hosts of Satan, the wicked challenger. Admitting defeat, Sennacherib drew his crippled army out of Judah without coming near to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> But that was not all his recompense for his blasphemies against the Most High God. Violent death awaited Sennacherib, even within his own capital city, Nineveh. And his own demon god, within the demon’s own temple, could not save Sennacherib from the dire fulfillment of Jehovah’s words. “But as he was worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech. and Sarezer slew him with the sword.” (2 Ki. 19:35-37, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Smith-Goodspeed)</span><span class="font5"> Never again would he or did he trouble Jehovah’s typical Theocracy at Jerusalem.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> What admonition, comfort and hope for us lies in that strange fact of history! This: At the time when Satan’s visible postwar organization will have made its loudest boasts and direst threats against Jehovah’s servants on earth of his Theocratic Government, then the night of Armageddon will settle down upon this world. The issue will have been clearly stated and the two sides sharply drawn for the decision. Then Jehovah’s witnesses, sheltered</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">29. At night what strange act took place, and what did Sennacherib do'’ 30 What further recompense for all his blasphemies came upon him? 31. What admonition, comfort and hope for the postwar future Ues for us in that strange fact of history? </span><span class="font5">within his Theocratic organization, will be under siege and will seem threatened with destruction by the overwhelming hosts of the antitypical Assyrian, Satan the Devil. Yet be not anxious of such a future: Jehovah will fight the battle for his remnant and their companions. He will perform his “strange act” at Armageddon, as he did thousands of years ago in the land of Judah, ‘for his own sake and for the sake of his beloved King.’ Doubtless by that same Son of God who served as the angel to slay 185,000 of Sennacherib’s hosts and send him reeling back to his own violent death, namely, by his reigning King-Son, Christ Jesus, will Jehovah God go forth to battle and will wreak destruction upon the wicked challenger’s world-organization. Like Sennacherib, Satan the Devil will see his visible organization on earth utterly laid low in death. Next he will see his invisible organization of demons dissolved in destruction, and will finally himself be wiped out violently. No demon power will be able to save him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“Then, glorious thought! Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus will stand intact, shining brilliantly in the victorious role of Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and universal sovereignty. Jehovah, before destroying all the enemy organization, will have made all challengers and opposers of his sovereignty to know that He is Jehovah; that is His name. But the remnant of Zion’s children and all those of good-will who will have come out from all the nations and taken their stand on the side of Zion, will survive victoriously with Zion. Being spared alive through Armageddon, they will know for ever that Jehovah is God alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">32 Whnt will then be the position of Jehovah's kingdom and of those that will have taken their stand for it?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark15"></a>THE RIGHT KIND OF GOOD-WILL</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">• ABE you on my side or not?’ That, in blunt phrase, Z-X was the question that King Jehu put to Jonadab.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was good reason to ask that question. King Jehu had progressed with his executional work and had slain the opposing kings of Israel and of Judah and the sons of wicked Ahab and others; and when he had finished with forty-two adherents of King Ahaziah, he met up with Jonadab. By that time Jonadab would have heard what Jehu was doing in Israel, or probably Jehu on this occasion first told him he was destroying Baalism out of Israel. Otherwise Jonadab would not have understood the question Jehu put to him. To quote the record of the incident: “And when he was departed thence, [Jehu] lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. [And Jehu replied:] If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and [Jehu] took him up to him into the chariot.” (2 Ki. 10:15) Manifestly Jehovah God permitted Jonadab or Jehonadab to appear in this prophetic drama for some good purpose, and that purpose, when known, must be an encouragement and comfort to “men of good will” today on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To bring present-day meaning into this ancient drama in which Jonadab acted, let this be understood: Jonadab represented or foreshadowed that class of people now on the earth when Christ Jesus, the King greater than Jehu, is carrying on his work amidst his enemies; and which Jonadab class take their stand on the side of righteousness and are the ones whom, if continuing obedient and faithful, the Lord Jesus Christ will preserve during the time of Armageddon, take them through that trouble, and give them everlasting life on earth. These are that “sheep” class described in the Lord’s parable (Matt. 25:32-40) and that favor God’s anointed people, because they know that the anointed of the Lord are doing His work. In support of the above conclusion the following is submitted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The name </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehonadab</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jonadab</span><span class="font4"> means </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah-largess, </span><span class="font4">or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is bounteous.</span><span class="font4"> This name would therefore suggest that Jonadab pictures the class to whom Jehovah is very generous. Jonadab was the son of Rechab, and his descendants came to be known as Rechabites. The Rechabites were sticklers for observing what they considered to be right as they were taught. Why? Evidently because their forefather Jonadab followed the course of honesty and meekness and did what he believed to be right, and he taught his children righteousness. So they followed a like course. For example, these Rechabite descendants of Jonadab received a commandment, not from Jehovah God but from man, that they must drink no wine for ever, that they should not build houses, but must dwell in tents. That meant that they must lead a simple life of self-denial Such faithfulness in doing what they had been taught by man because they understood it to be right Jehovah God used as an example against which to show up the unfaithfulness of the nation of Israel in failing to do what they were commanded by the Most High God. He had commanded the Israelites not to eat at the Devil’s table, that is, not to have anything to do with devil-worship; but the Israelites disregarded this commandment and turned to Baalism and other forms of religion. Today the so-called “organized religion”, in which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its priests take the lead in “Christendom”, disregard entirely the commandments of the Lord and attempt to eat and drink at His table while at the same time partaking of the Devil’s table by making their organization a part of Satan’s world. Excuse that as they may, yet the Lord says: “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.” (1 Cor. 10:21) Jehovah God hates a hypocrite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the official and governing body that rules the religionists of the world, and the so-called “Protestant” organizations are now linked up and jointly form what is called “organized religion”. What may here be said about the Hierarchy and the clergy or ruling body is not applied to individual sincere Catholics or sincere Protestants. There are millions of Catholics that are supposed to be members of the Catholic “church”, but they are not ranked as members; even the Hierarchy designates them as “the Catholic population”. No one should be held up to ridicule because he is a Roman Catholic. Sincere Catholics want to know the truth, and what is said in these columns in the way of criticism is for the purpose of enabling honest people to see how a few men have misled and defrauded millions of honest persons. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the governing body, together with the clergy of the other religious sects, claim to be the representatives of God and the ones to whom the right is delegated to proclaim his Word. They claim to be Christians; therefore they are at least in an implied covenant to do the will of God, the Father of Christ. But, to the contrary, they have not obeyed His commandments. They have followed their own selfish desires. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that religious-political governing body, have misguided and greatly deceived millions of honest persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of such honest persons have given support to the Catholic organization, both financially and morally and otherwise, but they have not at all approved the hypocrisy practiced in these organizations. Many other persons of sincerity outside of “organized religion” have desired to do right and still have such desire and wish to know and to serve Jehovah God. The time must come when these people of honesty will receive an opportunity to hear and to know the truth; and that time has now come. The hypocritical class within “organized religion” were foreshadowed by the faithless Israelites in the days of Jonadab who claimed to be Jehovah’s people and yet who refused to obey God and turned from His worship to Baalism or demonism. The persons of good-will now on earth were foreshadowed by those of the house of Jonadab, and hence are called “Jonadabs”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah caused his prophet Jeremiah to utter a prophecy in which the faithless Israelites are strongly contrasted with the Jonadabs. Such prophecy foretold that Jehovah will reject hypocritical “organized religion”, and particularly the leaders of it, and that he will extend his favor and blessing to the people of good-will who take their stand on the side of righteousness and who were foreshadowed by the house of Jonadab, the Rechabitcs. The way the prophecy came about is as follows: “The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”—Jer. 35:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This part of the prophecy foreshadows that God opens the way for those people of good-will now on the earth to be brought into his house or temple of worship and to receive his blessings. Many persons of good-will are now observed coming unto the Theocratic organization of Jehovah to prove their good-will, as this prophecy foreshadowed. The prophet Jeremiah then continues: “Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; and I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: and I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Observe that the Rechabites refused to drink wine that was offered to them, thus showing their determination to be faithful to what they had promised a man, their father. They were determined to keep their word of promise. What they further promised, they went on to explain, saying: “Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers. Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed: but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.”—Jer. 35:3-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those Rechabites of the house of Jonadab had not set their heart on worldly riches, such as houses and vineyards. Their dwelling in tents symbolically says they were sojourners, looking for a better government over humankind, this desire being like that which had filled the hearts of the faithful men of old, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who by faith had looked forward to a heavenly Government, to wit, the righteous Government of Jehovah God under Christ Jesus, and which is symbolized in Scripture as a “Holy City”. (See Hebrews 11:14-16; Revelation 21:2, 9, 10.) The Jonadab Rechabites went to dwell inside a city, Jerusalem, when the Chaldean armies invaded the country and threatened the city, thus illustrating or picturing the people of good-will of the present time as seeking a place of peace and safety with God’s organization on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a purpose Jehovah by the prophecy makes a strong contrast between the one class and the other, showing his displeasure with the covenant-breakers, namely, the Israelites, and showing his pleasure in those men of the house of Rechab, namely, the Jonadabs that had faithfully kept their agreement to do what they had promised. Thus Jeremiah continues: “Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the Lord. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I [God] have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye [Israelites] hearkened not unto me. I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.”—Jer. 35:12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This prophecy concerning the Israelites exactly describes the course of action taken by the so-called “organized religion” under the leadership of the clergy governing factors, a course which is so apparent today among these organizations on earth. Particularly the ruling element of the Roman Catholic organization, and the clergy of other organizations, have made great pretenses of serving God, but in fact have been engaged in serving the Devil and have by their course of action deceived millions and led them to believe that they as governing factors or clergymen are servants of God. The whole ruling element, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the chief men supporting their organization for controlling and ruling the “Catholic population”, have been entirely unfaithful to God. The honest, sincere ones of the “Catholic population” who truly incline toward God were foreshadowed by the Jonadabs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Speaking with words which today apply to the people of good-will that take their stand for Him, Jehovah continues the prophecy: “Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people [Israelites] hath not hearkened unto me: therefore thus saith the Lonn God of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.” “And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Because ye hav e obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you: therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.” Or, according to the Bible’s marginal reading of this statement: “There shall not a man be cut off from Jonadab the son of Rechab to stand before me for ever.”—Jer. 35: 16-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here is a positive promise from Jehovah to the people of good-will now on earth, who take their stand firmly on the side of the Lord God and continue faithful there, that they will in due time enter into great riches and stand approved before Him for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reverting back now to the prophetic drama in which Jonadab and Jehu come in contact with each other: The Scripture record shows conclusively that Jonadab was against the Devil religion called Baalism. According to the record, Jehu 'lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.” (2 Ki. 10:15) Jonadab knew that Jehu was then doing the work commanded by Jehovah to destroy the Devil-worshipers out of the land, and Jonadab knew that such was a righteous work, and sympathized with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Likewise at the present time those people on earth of good-will, who learn of the work that Jehovah’s witnesses are now doing under the Greater Jehu, Christ Jesus, know that such is a righteous work; and these people are in full sympathy with that work and desire to be identified with that righteous work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chariot in which King Jehu rode pictured or represented an organization. Since Jehu was riding the chariot while engaged in the work of Jehovah, his chariot pictured Jehovah’s organization now functioning with a visible part on the earth, which visible part is His “faithful servant” class, Jehovah’s remnant, who are His anointed witnesses acting under the leadership of Christ Jesus. Jehu grasped hold of Jonadab’s hand and asked him to get up into the chariot. In this, Jehu pictured the Lord Jesus giving aid through the remnant to those persons of good-will who desired to unite themselves to his Theocratic organization Note that Jehu did this after Jonadab had sincerely expressed himself as being of the same heart or mind as King Jehu; which means that Jonadab was in full sympathy with Jehu and his work and that his motive was like that of Jehu, namely, unselfish. Jonadab’s action showed him on the side of the true God, Jehovah. This proves that those who would have the blessing of the Lord God must declare themselves on the side of both Him and his kingdom, and they must take their position with the visible organization of Jehovah on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehu, having found Jonadab in full heart accord and in sympathy with him and his work, no doubt told Jonadab what he was about to do. “And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in ins chariot.” (2 Ki. 10: 16, Am. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Stan.</span><span class="font4"> Ver.) Jehu was not boasting of his zeal, but was notifying Jonadab to observe the proper course of one who agrees to do the will of God. What Jehu did he did earnestly and enthusiastically. His words mean that he was determined to accomplish the purpose and work which Jehovah God had assigned to him and that he would do so in the Lord's name and by his grace. So Jonadab went with Jehu and unquestionably supported Jehu in his work, keeping his promise of a helping hand, and doing what he was asked and told to do by the king. By giving his hand to Jonadab, King Jehu symbolically said to him ‘I will use my power for you and give you aid, support and comfort, and will teach you the right way to serve Jehovah God with zeal like mine.’ In the same manner the Greater Jehu, Christ Jesus, in the great chariot of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization, now speaks to the Jonadab class, those who now show the right kind of good-will, namely, that toward Jehovah God and his kingdom by Chnst Jesus.</span></p>

He then made a special trip to Bendigo (93 miles) to see me, and after a discussion took another pile of literature, including </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'The Truth Shall Make You Free’.</span><span class="font4"> He also took out a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> and arrangements were made for a book study in Melbourne?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sydney, N. S. W.: “A Yugoslav who is doing very well with his English now relates this: ‘One after another, Catholic people were ending my witness with “Oh, but we’re Catholics!” I remembered the lesson on Theocratic tactfulness in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry Course</span><span class="font4"> and at the next house I replied: “I was, too, once. Remember the old Catholic proverb, ‘You must hear two bells to tell which one chimes best’! Well, what about reading one of these books, so that you can see how the Kingdom message sounds!” This appealed to her, and she took some publications. You may be sure I will be back to help her learn about the Kingdom?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Melbourne, Victoria: “While following through on my literature placements, I called in on a family who had previously heard some of the lecture recordings. The small daughter answered the door and exclaimed: ‘Oh, our Sunday-school teacher is here!’ The Sunday-school teacher came out from behind her and said: ‘These people don’t want Jehovah’s witnesses here!’ With that, she slammed the door. However, the child pulled the door open again, and the father called from down the passage: ‘Come in!’ So I went in and had a grand time with them. The Sunday-school teacher left in a hurry.”—Pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“WHILE ON PAVEMENT WITNESSING (BRITAIN)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">on Monday of this week I had a grand experience. A tall young man came up to me and said: ‘I am not one of you, but I do admire you people for the stand you take. I am a wholesale commercial traveler; and, looking at it from a worldly point of view, Jehovah’s witnesses are the broken link in the chain that the dictators cannot mend and that’s why you get so much opposition. My home is in Exeter and I tell my wife always to buy books of these Jehovah’s witnesses, as in so doing I believe wc are supporting our only way to freedom? I thought it was grand. Who knows but that he is a sheep?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STREET WITNESSING IN ALASKA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“While standing on the street near the post office, which is a busy place in Ketchikan and ideal for magazine work, an officer came up to me and asked what I was selling. I told him I was preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom and that I was distributing the magazines explaining about that kingdom and that they were left with the people on a five-cent contribution. I asked him if he had ever read any of them, and he said “Yes’. He then asked me to go with him to see the judge and explain the nature of our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“At the police station the officer told the judge, ‘This is the young man who is selling those magazines? At this point I started to explain to the judge the manner in which we preached. He said there was a city ordinance against peddling in Ketchikan. I said city ordinances pertaining to peddling did not apply to Jehovah’s witnesses. I showed him newspaper clippings to prove that the Supreme Court upheld our right to carry on this work and that when any state, city, or municipality tried to apply such anti-peddling ordinances against Jehovah’s witnesses they were unconstitutional. I also showed the judge and the officer </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> No. 658, which contains a brief report on thirty-one cases tried in the Supreme Court which involved Jehovah’s witnesses, and which report showed the good that came to the people of the United States because of the fight that Jehovah’s witnesses had waged in the highest court of the land. The officer then asked to see my registration card, and how long I had been here and where I had come from. I was then told by the judge to continue on in our work, and that meanwhile he would find out whether we could continue or not. The officer then took me back to my post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The next day, on returning from a study I met the same officer. He stopped me and asked if I had been selling. I answered that I was just returning from a Bible study and that I was not selling. He said, ‘You had better go and get a permit or quit selling!’ I told him the same as I had the day previous, and that I would not quit. ‘I’ll arrest you if I catch you selling,’ he answered. ‘You have a duty to perform; so have I,’ I responded. Later this same officer met my partner in the magazine work and informed him that he would have to obtain a permit to sell books. My partner told him practically the same as I did, and the officer, instead of arresting him, got in his truck and drove off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The next day my partner and I paid a visit to the city attorney. We explained exactly what had happened. He admitted the United States Supreme Court had settled the issue and that we should not be bothered, but that if we were to phone him. Several days later the same officer saw me passing by and hollered out, ‘Hey, Watchtower!’ I turned and waited till he came over. He said, ‘I found out you fellows were within your legal rights and that I was wrong. I was simply obeying the judge’s orders. I had a duty to do and I was going to do it? I told him we undei -stood. With that he left, and so did I, to continue on in the service, and praising the Lord for His blessings.” —A graduate of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THAWING OUT THE FAMILY (SOUTH AFRICA)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When I arrived at a back-call book study the house appeared to be full of visitors, all of whom I subsequently learned were daughters, married and single, of the lady of the house, who,.with their boys and girls, were spending the day at the ‘old home’ with mother. They were rather resentful about the study, but, being in ‘mother’s home’, they would please her by attending. They sat stiffly in a row, their chairs planked against the wall, looking and no doubt feeling most uncomfortable, evidently expecting and fearing the worst, namely—‘a religious prayer meeting cum tea-party affair’. All being seated and provided with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> books, the study started. After the second question those sisters against the wall edged their chairs nearer to the table and then, after a good deal of whispering, they excused themselves and left the room, only to return very hurriedly a few minutes later each with an old ‘school Bible’, plucked from the limbo of things long forgotten, in their hands. From that moment they entered wholeheartedly into the study and declared their intention of being present the following week. They kept their word. All these have now returned to their respective homes, except one daughter, who regularly attends the study with her two children.”</span></p>
