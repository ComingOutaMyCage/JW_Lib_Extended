<p><span class="font6">HISTORY IS MADE IN HOLLYWOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HE motion picture industry has almost repealed the saying that ‘truth is stranger than fiction’. History creates events but once, often under the most undramatic circumstances and in only one locale for a limited few eyes. Technicolor movie cameras can re-create world-shaking acts thousands of years old, enabling modem audiences to relive them in all their original color and pageantry. Thoughtful script writers can add any needed drama that history thoughtlessly omitted. The year 1951 witnessed stupendous use of Hollywood’s powers, in a picture destined to be viewed by millions and perhaps attract attention of historian and Christian. This is Hollywood’s epic epic, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Quo Vadis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Including conception and planning, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Quo </span><span class="font3">Vadis involved twelve years of work. Production cost was set at more than $6,000,000. More than 500 sets included such constructions as Nero’s circus accommodating 30,000 persons, the massive front of his palace, a whole section of ancient Rome and a great bridge. Some 52,400 yards of material went into 32,000 costumes. Besides 235 speaking parts and mob scenes of thousands (over 40,000 applied to the casting department), the cast includes 63 lions, 2 cheetahs, 450 horses and assorted oxen, cattle, hogs and other animals. The breath-taking burning of Rome sequence required twenty-four nights of filming. The result was an epic of dramatic entertainment. Furthermore, the basic plot of Christians in the midst of persecution turned on by Nero’s Rome was handled with justice insofar as portraying the Christians as a decidedly “different” sort of people. They preached Chrjst’s kingdom and love, smiled at death and would have no part in Rome’s licentious and militaristic society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In just pride of the preproduction research the first-run program guide states: “No pains were spared to achieye as perfect accuracy as the most careful research could provide.” But on the side of constructive criticism we ask, Was the research quite careful enough? It is no secret that for centuries the Roman Catholic Church has sought by every means to prove the apostle Peter was in Rome as the first head of the Christian congregation there. She turned to the Bible. It was silent. She looked to history. Responsible historians would make no such assertion. But in Quo </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vadis</span><span class="font3"> M-G-M gets him there at last! Furthermore, in most obliging fashion, he is made “chief of the apostles”, has Jesus’ words concerning the rock on which his church was built applied to him and is crucified on Vatican Hill!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only the original language at Matthew 16:18, but Peter himself says the Christian Church’s foundation is Christ, not Peter. At 1 Peter 2:7 it is of Christ that Peter says, “the identical stone that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Boiled down, Catholicism’s</span><span class="font3"> chief &quot;proof” for Peter’s Roman sojourn seems to be based purely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">on an</span><span class="font3"> early legend. How such myth might easily have started is pointed out by Boston University Professor Henry C. Sheldon’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Christian Church</span><span class="font3"> (Vol. I), published in 1894, which says that &quot;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bishop of Rome,</span><span class="font3"> being favored by the associations of the imperial city, the mistress of the world, would be likely, ere long, to constitute </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">himself</span><span class="font3"> a successor of Peter, and to assert his fictitious claims with a good degree of success”. Sifnilarly, the Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451) speaks of favors bestowed on early Rome by &quot;the Fathers” “inasmuch as that city was the seat of empire”—in other words, for political motives. Catholics may note famed “St.” Augustine’s words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I have said in a certain passage respecting the Apostle Peter, that the Church upon him is founded as upon a rock. , , . But I know that 1 have frequently afterwards so expressed myself, that the phrase ‘Upon this rock,’ should be understood to be the rock which Peter confessed. For it was not said to him ‘Thou art </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">petra’</span><span class="font3"> but thou art </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Petrus,</span><span class="font3"> for the rock was Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Ironically, Quo </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vadis</span><span class="font3"> portrays both the apostles Paul and Peter in Rome, great metropolis of the Gentiles, at the same time, but completely subordinates Paul while exalting Peter as his superior. In reality Paul, not Peter, was known as the apostle to the Gentiles; and in writing the Roman Christians, mentioning thirty-five names and sending greetings to twenty-six, he fails even to mention their supposed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bishop,</span><span class="font3"> Peter. How would the pope today feel if one of his cardinals should address an official letter to the Vatican and so completely snub him? The film records the legend inspiring the original story that Peter was directed by Christ in a vision to return to Rome. But The Bible account, while never once associating Peter with Rome, does relate an occasion when </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font3">Lord stood over Paul in the night and ordered him, not Peter, to go to Rome to bear witness. (Acte 23:11) Much ado </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is made </span><span class="font3">over Peter’s having seen Christ in the flesh, Yet Paul had at least a partial revelation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christ's</span><span class="font3"> spiritual glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul is shown &quot;baptizing” by pouring a little water: from a vial over the heads of Christian converts. However, Christian baptism, as exemplified in Christ’s case, has ever been a full immersion in water. (Matthew 3:16) In the film, Paul demanded that a man release his slaves before becoming a Christian, claiming that Christians did not tolerate slavery. However, neither Paul nor the other apostles were social reformers. They were preachers of God’s kingdom by Christ. Relief from all evils they left for the Kingdom to accomplish in due time. Paul said </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">clearly: &quot;Were </span><span class="font3">you called a slave? Do not let it worry y&lt;bu; but if you can also become free, rather seize the opportunity.” But </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">by this he did </span><span class="font3">not mean to do so against the master’s wishes. He later sent the runaway slave, Onesimus, back to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his Christian</span><span class="font3"> master Philemon after Onesimus himself had become a Christian.-—1 Corinthians 7:21; Philemon 10-20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus it appears that Hollywood did more than make history in the dramatic field with an exciting motion picture. She saw fit as well to “make” history over to suit the interests of Catholicism. When one considers the superb research that was admittedly conducted for this production, it is unthinkable that such salient points relative to early Christianity could have been misunderstood by accident. Correction of these matters could have done the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">story no </span><span class="font3">conceivable harm. It would only have eliminated an obvious surrender to Rome at the expense of the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">the image is located in the chalk-and-brown hamlet of Suyapa, about six miles west of Tegucigalpa, the capital city of Honduras. The present large twin-towered temple of S u y a p a dwarfs into insignificance the small whitewashed adobe huts</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">it. Well, what is it? Imagine in your mind’s eye a small, exquisitely carved doll just two and three-fifths inches high. This little image is the center of all the attraction. It is the Patroness Saint of Honduras, the Mother pnd Queen of the Republic, Sacred Image, Queen of Angels, Star of Stars, more commonly known as the “Virgin of Suyapa”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It all started around 200 years ago, as the story goes. One day in the year 1747 two peons are said to have been heading homeward from their day’s work. Awaiting the light of the stars to walk by, they decided to stretch out by the side of the road, as darkness had overtaken them. One of them claimed something prodded him in the back, and, without looking at it, he hurled the object some distance away. But in a few moments he felt the prodding again. This time he detected a perfume odor surrounding the object of his trouble. He decided to wrap it and place it in his pocket till later when he could examine it. Lo, the next day he found it to be this tiny image of the virgin Mary. The village priest declared that it must have been abandoned by some family devoted to the virgin’s worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From this simple beginning, the fame of the image grew rapidly. Several temples were built to house it along with a retinue of other lesser images or “saints”. Today of the natives around it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Inside, the visitor or devotee sees the Suyapa image in the back of the room resting upon a sphere of silver about six inches high, which in turn rests upon a pedestal of the same height. This gives the image the semblance of being much taller than its two and three-fifths inches. Closer inspection shows it is dressed in a silk dress embroidered in gold and garnished with precious stones. Down through the years the doll has inherited necklaces, earrings, precious stones, ornaments of gold and silver and even a number of head of cattle. The image is not poor!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Little Doll’s “Big Day”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An outing for the virgin of Suyapa is quite an affair. Each February 3 has been set aside as Suyapa day in Honduras, and truly it is an all-out occasion. Business stores and offices close. The capital’s streets are given a thorough cleaning and then strewn with pine needles and boughs. Much time and care are spent in decorating the house fronts. In the open doorways can be seen, large and small, framed pictures of the “saints”, so placed as to enable them to “see” the virgin as the image passes. Bright-colored ribbons and lace curtains make their appearance hanging from windows and balconies. Long, multicolored paper streamers are stretched overhead</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">across the streets. Vendors pass through the streets selling charms and medals bearing the image’s picture. Anything can happen to one if he does not have a blessed medallion of the virgin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A chanted intonation becomes louder and louder, rising and falling, as the people recite after the priest the praises to the image. Next the procession appears. Little children dressed as “angels” are carried on the shoulders of devout worshipers of Suyapa. Here and there one can see the life-size statue saints bobbing up and down as they are borne along by the crowd. Ha! there it is, the throne chair of 'the tiny image of Suyapa. For such a small image, what a large carriage! Those struggling along with its weight on their shoulders paid hard-earned money for the privilege of carrying it, and they are considered by all to be well rewarded. From one temple to another the procession goes, stopping at each place while the priest blesses the crowds and newcomers. Mingled laughter and crying are heard together as the mass of people push forward in their effort to get as close to the little doll as possible. As the day draws to a close and night falls, hundreds of candles will light up the way as further processions carry the festivities into the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This Doll a &quot;Jack of All Trades”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The virgin of Suyapa plays a large role in the lives of many Honduran people. There just is not anything she is not supposed to be able to do. Are you sick? Did you lose something? Do you need some help to win a bet? How about a nice curse pronounced against your enemy? The name of the image is involved with all of that and much more. Illustrative of this is the manner of invoking the virgin to cure some form of sickness. No matter what it is, it can be cured. Just do the following: If your foot bothers you, or your arm is broken, or you have a sore head, then make a small head, arm or foot of pure silver (gold, if you can afford it, for quicker healing) and take it to Suyapa. Drop it into the coffer placed near the virgin and on bended knees make your petition to the “queen of heaven”, who can do all things. It is said you may return home confident that the cure is on its way. The virgin of Suyapa is known as the image that never refuses a favor. In the temple hanging on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wall </span><span class="font3">in glass cases are to be seen hundreds of silver and gold pieces, each shaped in the form of some part of the body, supposed to represent a miracle that has been performed by the virgin of Suyapa in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">healing </span><span class="font3">that particular part of someone’s body. These </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">exvotos,</span><span class="font3"> as they are called, can be found ready-made on sale at any jeweler’s shop ut downtown Tegucigalpa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the old days natives would make </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long </span><span class="font3">treks through the wilderness, walking barefoot over mountains day and night, sometimes carrying sick children, to reach the virgin. Often all they would have to eat would be a few </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tortillas</span><span class="font3"> and small bits of cheese. When they would come in sight of the temple they would drop to their knees and crawl up the rocky path until they reached the altar. Tradition has It that anyone spreading his coat or shirt along the way to ease the path of the crawling pilgrims would receive a special blessing from the virgin. With tom and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bloody </span><span class="font3">knees, frequently weak from hunger, they would prostrate themselves before the image to confess payment of a vow or to ask some special favor of the virgin. Even today many scorn those who would come the easy way to pay a vow to the image. If you do not walk or?crawl some distance, “How can you win £race?” they ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Snared in a Religious &quot;Doll House”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Almost every home, to the most humble adobe hut, has one comer of the front</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">room dedicated to house the family altar. Cakes or </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">tortillas</span><span class="font24"> are made daily and placed, along with drink, before the image, for its use. Sweet-smelling flowers or bits of pine sprigs adorn the altar where strips of colored crepe paper and bits of tinfoil surround an image or picture of the virgin of Suyapa. Large candies sputter away in their places before the crude shrine. “She will be pleased by this/' they like to say. If all goes well and a favor or petition is granted it is not unlikely that the image will receive a kiss. But woe to the virgin if the prayer is not answered’ It might be duly punished—no food or water for a time, or even a beating might be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Children, too, are taught to swear by and live by the virgin of Suyapa. Somewhere on their body, tied around the neck hanging on a bit of siring or chain, or pinned to some part of clothing, will be found a small image of Suyapa, put there for protection. The charm is not supposed to fail. Of course, if it does fail to deliver, the doll can always be spanked, as described above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy’s admitted practice of sanctifying by adoption into its system the pagan mysteries, symbols, images and customs of the past is well known. To what childish, utterly absurd extremes she will go is seen from Honduras’ virgin of Suyapa doll worship. Similarly, in ’Guatemala it is the “Black Christ” or image of Esquipulas: in Costa Rica, an “Indian” virgin Mary; in Mexico, the virgin of Guadalupe, etc., etc., on and on. The pattern is the same throughout Early In the history of each country, the hierarchy, working through its priests, introduced and encouraged the use of the multitudinous images and “saints”, one of which was destined to become patron or patroness of each country. With such image worship as the lure, their typical hierarchical structure was planted upon the necks of the populace. Into great, templelike “doll houses&quot; were the helpless people drawn to pay their vows to the image gods and be bled of their meager earnings. Worst of all is the frightful mental bondage into which the doll’s devotees have been plunged through their superstitious dread of displeasing the &quot;saints”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">If people today, as in the Republic of Honduras, sigh and cry for the abominations they see abounding in the land, they must realize that they cannot go to images for relief. Such mediums are deaf and hear nothing. &quot;What doth the graven thing avail, because the maker thereof hath graven it. a molten and a false image, because the forger thereof hath trusted in a thing of his own forging, to make dumb idols? Woe to him that salth to wood: Awake. To the dumb stone, Arise. Can it teach? Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no spirit in the bowels thereof.&quot;—Habakkuk 2:18,19, Catholic Douay Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Only by turning to the Word of God, the Bible, and seeking therein information about the true and living God can they find a measure of relief now. Then in the near future they can hope for the new world promised in God’s Word where righteousness is to dwell, and which will usher in peace and happiness and freedom of pure, right worship for all lovers of justice and truth. Flee images and live.</span></p>

<p><span class="font24">HEN the subject of compulsory blood transfusions came up in Chicago, Illinois, in April of last year, the wires of the national news services, as usual, gave only prejudiced accounts of the matter, and local clergymen did their hit to ridicule and bring condemnation upon the stand taken by Jehovah’s witnesses. So that newspaper editors might be fully acquainted with the facts, as wall as have the opportunity to present these to their readers, the Watchtower Society instructed each company or congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States to supply the editor of each newspaper in its territory with a copy of the Awake! magazine that gave the Scriptural position of Jehovah’s witnesses on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">In obedience to these instructions the editor of the Akron, Ohio, Beacon Journal was interviewed. The one making the interview was equipped to give an effective witness, and as a result a series of four articles, of some thousand words each, and accompanied by photographs, fairly setting forth the beliefs and activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, was published In this journal, September 4 to 7 inclusive. The introduction to this series was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Forceful Belief Spurs Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span><span class="font24"> Jehovah’s Witnesses have a religion they take far more seriously than the great majority of people. Their principles remind us of the early Christians who were so unpopular and who were persecuted so brutally by the Romans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">“Here Is a group of people who actually believe their religion and propose that other people shall believe it as well. Jehovah’s Witnesses are New Testament Christians and they read the text as an Infallible Scripture and believe what they read. Thug when they read that the end of the world is at hand, that Jesus is coming back to earth and that He will set up His Kingdom on earth and judge between the good and the bad, that’s exactly what they believe—and io the letter. All of this Is what they call the truth, and in their ministry they strive to bring the truth to all others 'who have *not yet been brought the truth’. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">“Because the Witnesses believe their religion, they are peculiarly aggressive. They are not satisfied to follow their religion in the manner of others because ’the time is too short’ for routine work. The case of Jehovah’s Witnesses presents an issue as old as Christianity. These sincere men and women ask for nothing but the right to ^roolaim their religion and to commend it to the acceptance of their fellow men. And they are willing to suffer for this right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The four articles dealing with Jehovah’s Witnesses were entitled as follows: “Forceful Belief Spurs Jehovah’s Witnesses,” “ 'Witnesses’ Preach by Tracts,” “Every Man a Minister, Is Witnesses’ Belief,” &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses Claim Ministers’ Rights.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Incidentally, the Akron </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Beacon Journal was </span><span class="font24">not the only paper that responded to the interview, as many others published articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Church Goes to the Races—and Parish </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font24"> the Cleaners/</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Our Lady and All Saints Catholic Church of Stourbridge, England, wanted $28,000 for a new church school. So &quot;Rev.” J. O'Dowd decided to run a weekly football draw among parishioners. Then complications set in. Included on the draw coupons were race horse tips furnished by an “expert” who revealed himself only as “Dead Cert”. For seven consecutive weeks &quot;Dead Cert” scored bull’s-eyes, while jubilant parishioners reaped returns, nonchurchgoers hopped on the band wagon and local bookmakers mourned. Then came the eighth week. The inevitable law of averages caught up With &quot;Dead Cert” when not one of his picks even placed. Gloom settled over the parish. The anonymous “horse shark&quot; was identified, and it was revealed that he had given his tips to </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font24"> church, which in turn had sold them to parishioners. Reports did not disclose “Rev.” O’Dowd’s fate. However, the Bible discloses little hope for supposed shepherds that lead supposed sheep from Christ’s footsteps and into gamblers’ footsteps.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">.-. The country has got rid of a party that it did not want In favor of one that it does not trust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ChurchiU greeted the election returns with a broad smile and his traditional World War II “V for victory” sign, then quickly and confidently formed his cabinet. The scales could now balance the campaign issues and the new leaders.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">ATE last October Britain climaxed twenty months of political chaos with a general election. For that long the Labor government had controlled the country by the slimmest of possible margins. At every turn her leaders faced perpetual fear of challenge and a new election common to the British electoral system. At last the blow came, Labor was ousted and the Conservatives, or “Tories”, found themselves back in power behind their apparently indomitable leader, Winston Churchill. But the election did not lift the same political stalemate, for it barely swung the pendulum back in the opposite direction, leaving the margin of victory scarcely greater than Labor had previously enjoyed. The new government formed on thin ice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Would Churchill be as helpless as Attlee in coping with problems of the empire? How would the home front fare, in industry, capital, labor? Would the new leaders be able to arrest the pitiful plunge of Britain’s international prestige? The British press was pessimistic. Said one writer, apparently referring to what he considered the election’s only real change: “Mr. Churchill will preside over this melancholy scene instead of Mr. Attlee. No doubt he will welcome the change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Empire: Would Holding It</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mean War?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In light of Britain’s many empire crises and her fading international prestige, foreign policy questions were heated. Persia and Egypt were afflictions causing immediate pain. Both political parties were under no illusions as to the delicate balance between war and peace now existing in the world. The former Labor foreign minister declared, “We are not going to have a quiet and comfortable life in the years ahead, whoever is in Downing Street.” The old government’s tactics in handling the Iranian oil dispute had been sharply criticized on many sides. In answer to Conservative taunts, the foreign secretary had asked Mr. Churchill point blank if he was prepared to go to war over the oil fields. To this Mr. Churchill replied that Mr.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Morrison had no right to ask such a ques-</span></p><img src="g_E_19520122_files/g_E_19520122-8.png" alt="" style="width:408pt;height:206pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">tion, and that if the Conservatives had been in office, matters would not have been allowed to so deteriorate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the colonial question in general a new and clear-cut stand seemed necessary. The old Labor government had become very unpopular through its policy of giving ever larger shares of self-government to the colonies. This, home critics said, had led to disaffection and the breakup of the empire spirit. One of the colonial problems involved the future of the protectorates of Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland, in South Africa. On this, both major parties had answered alike, that no British government would hand over the three territories to South African rule without consulting the native peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The old Labor government had initiated a defense program to cost £4,700,000,000 in the next three years. Aneurin Bevan promptly led a revolt within the party, declaring it could never be met. The Conservatives had previously favored strong defense proposals, but recently had to alter</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">the Laborite program, and Churchill said and Bevan had been right “by accident”.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">On one hand an “underground campaign” moved against the Conservatives, planting the strong inference that Winston Churchill was a warmonger and that a Tory vote was a war vote. Churchill denounced such a charge as “base and mean beyond compare”. Said he: “If I remain in public office at this juncture, it is because rightly or wrongly, but eincerely, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I believe </span><span class="font3">that I may be able to make an important contribution to the prevention of a third world war and to bring nearer that lasting peace settlement which all desire. I pray indeed that I may have this opportunity. It is the last prize I seek to win.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Home Front: More Control</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Less?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At home, one of the great problems will be that of keeping the rank and file of the laboring classes tinder control. With the rising cost of living, workingmen have been agitating for higher wages, and the labor unions have been hard put to keep a restraining hand over them lest they should embarrass the Labor government. Strikes had been put off, but just how long this would continue with a Conservative government in .power remained to be seen. “Reactions of the trade unions to a Tory government will depend upon the policies pursued by that government,” said Mr. Arthur Deacon, chairman of the Trade Union Congress. “Governments come and governments go, and we have got to work with governments, but very clearly we shall go on striving to do those things which we regard as advantageous to the people we represent,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the time the election result was known, it was assumed that Labor, in losing, was left so strong a contender as to be a constant thorn in the new government’s side. The two forces were envisioned shouting their respective cries, “nationalize” denationalize”, on one important domestic measure after another. The domestic scene provided ample problems for the shouting to start over. Little had been said throughout the campaign about what would be done to meet the problems. Summing up the matter, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Economist</span><span class="font3"> said succinctly: “Between the two major parties, the chief distinction is that the Labor manifesto does not admit the existence of an unsolved economic problem for Britain, while the two Conservative documents recognize its existence but do not say what a Conservative government would do about it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Industrially, Britain was riddled with unrest. The Conservatives had advanced an excess profits tax, which businessmen generally deplore and which hinders the development of industry and discourages</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">enterprise; but this may be considered merely something to attract the workingman’s vote and draw the middle classes away from Labor.. Again and again Tory promises assured that they did not intend to tamper with the framework of the Welfare State. They have stated: “No more industries will be nationalized. The iron and steel trade will be freed. The coal industry will be decentralized, bus and tram services will not be removed from municipal or private control. Road haulers will be allowed again to enter their own business.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religion Provokes Side Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For long British Roman Catholics have agitated against the Education Act of 1944. During the campaign opportunity </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">name</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">to relight the old flame when Mr. Richard Stokes, Lord Privy Seal, himself a Catholic, hinted broadly that if re-elected the government would make adjustments in the act. The Catholic position was reiterated by Dr. Downey, Roman Catholic archbishop of Liverpool, on October 21. He declared that Catholics would simply be “administered out of existence” unless they continued to oppose the clause in the 1944 act compelling them to bear one-half of the cost of bringing their schools up to Ministry of Education standards and the entire cost of building new schools. According to his logic this meant the Catholics of Britain would have to “pay a fine” of £51 million to keep their schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But other religious denominations accept the 1944 law, and the Free Church Federal Council’s Education Committee formally protested the Catholic position. The Liberals also issued a statement saying they are anxious that the principles of the 1944 act “shall not be abandoned so as to revive acute controversy in the field of education, and that political parties should rigidly refrain from making promises designed to capture the votes of the Roman Catholic community”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both sides had offered full support to the United Nations, Regarding this policy, the Conservative spokesman asserted that his party would “continue to back the United Nations to the hilt”. On Anglo-American relations, he further affirmed: “The greatest hope for the peace of the world is the closest co-operation between Great Britain and the United States, in consort with the Commonwealth and aided by the democracies of Europe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the surprise of no one, Churchill has, since the election, indicated clearly that this close Anglo-American association will be part of his program. Regardless of his small majority he has declared his party will keep doing its duty “however unpopular it may be”. The test is on at a trying crossroads for the British empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How many times have great and seemingly impregnable empires been brought low by the shock of wars and political and economic deterioration in the history of men? Careful students of such events do not deny the inevitable cycle that dogs the trail of weak and dying man and his attempts to rule himself. Repeated failure in the past teaches that shaky human alliances and confederacies are no sure hope or stabilizing force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But men of good will from all present dying kingdoms, empires, democracies and police states can look with confidence to the near future when stability will return to the earth under the dominion of Jehovah God’s promised messianic kingdom by his Son. All present foreign and domestic problems will vanish, as “they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people”.—Isaiah 65:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ASSASSINATION IN PAKISTAN</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">O</span><span class="font24">N October 16, 1951, Liaquat-Ali-Khan, &lt;&nbsp;prime minister of Pakistan, was assassinated in an .air of mystery, drama and pathos. The event was another shocking addi* tion to an appalling list of Middle-East polit- &gt;&nbsp;leal assassinations since the close of World ; War IL It was mildly mysterious, since the &lt;&nbsp;nearest seat was thought to be out </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">of revolver</span><span class="font24"> J range. It was dramatic in that near-mob panic { was produced. It was pathetic when the ? crowds, later, not realising their beloved lead- S er was dead, kept shouting, </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">“Liaquat-Ali-Khan &lt;&nbsp;zindabad&quot;</span><span class="font24"> &quot;Long live Liaquat-Ali-Khan.” £</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">This man of moderate political views had j been widely respected. He had gained a broad J and democratic foundation from his education J in Oxford, England, and, in law, at Temple j-Bar. Since joining the Moslem League in 1937, j he had had a prominent part in leading the J struggle for freedom from British imperialism. That he was a man of integrity and a cut above the average politician is seen in the f fact that at his sudden death his possessions were negligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">A favored rumor behind the assassination was that Bharat (India), to further her ambitions in Kashmir, engineered the killing. But ? what little evidence there is seemed to point J<sup>! </sup>elsewhere. The killer was an Afghan on whose person was found a large sum of money, denoting financial backing. Further, just before the killing, the Afghan consul returned home . unexpectedly by air. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The world In general was gratified that &lt;&nbsp;Pakistan did not disintegrate in panic and fly &lt;&nbsp;to arms. Today any war is potentially a world war. Powerful blocs of nations are poised in J battle array, requiring only a spark to ignite j a conflagration. And sparks are plentiful: Korea, Palestine, Iran, Berlin, Egypt, Kashmir. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">What was world reaction to the plight of ■ Pakistan in view of this? Britain's Winston <sub>? </sub>Churchill declared the incident &quot;will complicate their [India and Pakistan’s] difficult task” of building peace. Nehru of India described the murdered leader as &quot;a steadying influence” departed from Pakistan, The Berlin news-paper </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Der Tagesspiegel</span><span class="font24"> announced: &quot;The dan- ’ </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">ger</span><span class="font24"> of war between Pakistan and India becomes greater&quot;; and the LT. N. Kashmir </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">envoy, </span><span class="font24">Frank Graham, said; *‘Wo rid peace may depend on Kashmir.” British newspapers stressed the urgent need now more than ever to secure a settlement </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">on Kashmir,</span><span class="font24"> one stating that the assassin had &quot;shaken the stability of South Asia”. Meanwhile India’s Dr. Muker-ji responded by pouring out fiery speeches against Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">/ On October 17 thirty-one guns saluted the passage of the dead leader's body on its way to the grave* On the 20th the same number saluted the inauguration of the second prime minister of the four-year-old Pakistanian state, Khwaja Nazimuddin. Without a constitution, the country continues to be governed by the originally appointed Constituent Assembly, and from among these the new prime minister selected his cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Liberal minds seemed relieved that Khawaja Nazimuddin, like </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Liaquat-Al^Khan,</span><span class="font24"> is a man of moderate temperament, and possessed of educational background and political activity </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font24"> similar to that of his predecessor, This philosophy is considered to have stood the nation in good stead. First listed in his declared policy in office was the settlement of the Kashmir issue: by a free plebiscite as first recourse, by war as second. This leaves the problem just where it was. India declines any plebiscite arranged by any but herself. Said Nazimuddin in his poJicy-oudming address: “If this fire is kindled [in Kashmir] the edifice of peace may well be reduced to ashes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The people of Pakistan are to be congratulated on their excellent discipline in this orisis now past, and the leaders on their ability to bridge a dangerous chasm. </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">It is a</span><span class="font24"> Joy to all lovers of righteousness to know that soon assassinations or other acts of violence likely to explode in global war will mark this earth no more. peace and all extend from east to west, bringing security and contentment the entire course of the sun. No fears then by nations large or small, for &quot;nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more”.—Isaiah 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A</span><span class="font5"> DAY when traffic jams, bumpy roads and Sunday drivers may soon be the thing of the past! People will look back and wonder how they ever escaped the twentiethcentury deathtrap. The new contraption apparently destined to revolutionize modem travel is the helicopter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This ugly duckling of the aeronautical sciences is one of the big surprises of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Korean war. It has put fighting units in the fighting line, fresh and strong, and not fagged out from miles of hiking and climbing. It has landed troops and medical equipment on peaks and rugged hills. It has evacuated the wounded, supplied isolated positions and carted specialists and brass around. The helicopter’s “can-do-it” has changed her from Cinderella to fairy princess almost overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This clumsy flying banana’s potpourri of chores includes: rescues, spraying and dusting crops, fertilizing land, fruit picking, aerial photography, forest fire fighting and patrol, water-front patrol and hauling mail. And it may soon become queen of commuters’ transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While still just a baby, the helicopter idea is nothing new. Louis Breguet, a French aircraft designer, is sometimes called the daddy of the hybrid offspring. In 1907, he constructed one that actually did lift him off the earth, but soon gave up the idea because he had difficulty controlling it in the air. The Wright brothers knew of this windmill mechanism long before they constructed their famous Kitty Hawk, Far back in the thirteenth century the Chinese were said to have constructed</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">a toy helicopter, with the modem principle of operation. It was not until 1909, however, that the first successful helicopter was built in the United States. Igor I. Sikorsky is credited with having designed and operated the first rotor-wing type helicopter like those of today. He later confessed his experiments failed because of lack of knowledge and horsepower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Since then, some 1,200 helicopters of various makes and models have been made, but only a few are privately owned. The government has priority on all output for the time being. Most of the companies geared to produce helicopters are eagerly awaiting the go-ahead signal to supply civilian demand. Wiggins Airways of Norwood, Massachusetts, reports that they plan to convert their entire airway system to helicopters as soon as possible. If this be done there will be helicopter transportation from Boston to Albany and to more than twenty other New England communities, which are now being served with conventional-type plane transportation. Wiggins plans to extend this service to New York city and vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief objection to the conventional-type plane is that the commuters spend</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">as much time or more getting to the airport or from the airport as they actually do in the air. This is true especially in larger cities such as Detroit, New York city, Washington, D.C., Chicago and Boston, where airports are located on the outskirts of the city. The passengers put up with it now because they feel there is no faster means. Now with the production of the helicopter this is all being revolutionized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">'Heliports’ are being built. The first of its kind to be built is on top of the Port Authority’s building in the heart of New York city. Helicopter taxi service will be conducted from the airports to the downtown shopping district in nothing flat. Travel time will be reduced as much as 80 per cent. The 25 minutes that it takes to get from Manhattan to La Guardia Airport will be reduced to a mere 7 minutes by the flying grasshopper. The 38-minute limousine ride from Manhattan to Newark, New Jersey, will be sliced to a thin 9-minute hop. The 42 minutes spent zigzagging through traffic to the Idlewild airport from Manhattan will be telescoped to no more than 11 minutes. With these revolutionary changes in sight the future of the helicopter is a bright one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has other distinctive features that catch the commercial eye. Its speed and lack of speed. It needs no large airports and can fly in almost any kind of weather. Being able to go forward or back, up or down, sideways, glide or loop, or stop dead still and hover in one spot, makes it almost indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Civil defense units are crying for them. In the event of an atomic attack, automobile, truck and other surface transportation will be paralyzed. Paths will have to be dug through the wreckage to bring relief to the disaster centers. This takes time. The helicopter will not be hampered or bogged down by any of this. Almost immediately she can transport doctors, nurses, medical and food supplies to the disaster $cene. She has proved her ability to do this in the Korean war. For her noble Job she has been decorated with the distinctive title “flying angel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Miners have found the whirlybird indispensable to them too. The hours that it takes to wind down to a mine at the base of a 2,000-foot canyon and up again at nightfall, can be done in nothing flat with the helping hand of the helicopter. Supplies can be brought. Mail can be delivered. In sleet, snow and fog, which would virtually stop mountain truck traffic the queer bird with the whirling umbrella will descend and ascend with the greatest of ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ranchers have taken a liking to her. They call her the miracle-worker of the West. Thousands of acres can be sprayed, dusted or fertilized in almost any kind of terrain. They have used her to spot cattle and pick fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Architects viewing the future through the 'helicoptic eye’ are driven crazy with visions of a new kind of world. Most of the automobile arteries will be under cultivation. They see out-of-the-way places inhabited. Houses with flat roofs with a pleasantly designed garage in one comer. Hotel and apartment roofs with hangar space and short landing strips. New va«a-tion centers for many. South America, Alaska, and the islands to the south will be just a mere stone’s throw away. A 400-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mile trip in one day by car is tiring, but</span><span class="font3"> a 1,000-mile trip in a helicopter will be nothing unusual or fatiguing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But a question presents itself: with hundreds of thousands of helicopters in the air at one time, what can be done to prevent a five-o’clock skyway traffic jam? Traffic lanes as high as the sky can be created. Each at a different altitude. Oneway lanes, lanes for slow and fast traffic, lovers’ lane and lanes for our sightseers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and Sunday drivers. The supersonic jet or atomic planes could fly high in the stratosphere above all these lanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let's have a look into the future and see how father takes the wife and children in the family 'copter to a lake some 50 miles away. A button is pushed. The garage door opens. The ’copter is taxied out The family climb aboard and are seated as comfortably as they once were in the family car. Dad takes hold of the control stick, presses a button, the huge rotor blades begin to spin. In the cabin, the radio is playing softly, no noise is heard or vibration felt. Slowly, gently, smoothly the 'copter ascends. The home becomes smaller below. At 1,200 feet they have reached their traffic lane. The control stick is moved slightly forward, changing the pitch of the rotor blades so that they bite the air for forward movement. The earth below seems to move, new homes appear, the winding rivers and checkerboard-like land is a thrill to behold. Thirty minutes have passed and they are over the picnic grounds next to the lake. The control stick is fixed in the neutral position, the ’copter comes to a halt in midair. The throttle is cut and slowly they descend onto a clearing about the size of a tennis court. Nerve-racking? No. The operation is simpler than handling an automobile. Fewer controls, fewer motions, easier on the nerves, no screaming breaks, no red lights or blinding lights, and no cross streets, jay walkers or close calls. The cost is about the same as an ordinary car. There are fewer parts, which means less wear. The ’copter will cover about 15 miles to a gallon of gas. Now, wouldn’t you like to fly one? Anyone can hover a helicopter in a few minutes. After </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12</span><span class="font5"> hours you can solo. You are bound to become an enthusiast from the start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Oh, but wait. What would happen if suddenly the engine would develop trouble? Nothing really. Automatically the machine would adjust itself to gliding position, the clutch frees the engine from the rotor blades, allowing the rotor blades to spin free by air pressure. The rest of the controls remain normal. The spinning blades enable the ’copter to descend safely from any height. In bad weather, mountainous terrain presents a problem to almost any kind of craft. In the conventional-type plane, the pilot leans heavily to his every electronic navigation aid or crashes into the mountainside. The ’copter pilot, on the other hand, slows down his speed to a creeping pace. When coming face to face with a mountain peak, he stops, backs up, if necessary, and up and over he goes and is on his way. The same goes for landing. He can take off on a dime and land on one, and do it as gingerly as a hen settles down on her eggs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This “egg beater of the air” might be considered a slow poke as far as aircraft is concerned, but she is no sitting duck. Designers are hard at work putting power into her shapeless body. Britain is designing two-engine helicopters for speed and safety. Recently, a convertible ’copter has been developed. This bird with an altogether different style of feathers is streamlined for speed. Experts predict this slow poke someday will travel at supersonic speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pint-size engine weighing less than 100 pounds powered by rockets is the newest thing in one-man helicopters. This contraption is strapped to a man and in Buck Rogers fashion he is rocketed off into space. Who knows, someday one might carry in his brief case a collapsible-type helicopter!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">i Fantastic you say! Maybe so, but stranger things have happened. Helicopter buses, to business and pleasure, are a reality. They can do anything the hummingbird can do and a few things the bird cannot do. These flying buses of today may well become the family car of tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Court Seizes Child for Blood Transfusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font24">HE following</span><span class="font24"> interest-rousing dispatch appeared on International News Service dated New York, October 13, 1951:</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">&quot;A three-year-old critically ill boy was given a court-entered blood transfusion today despite the religious objections of his mother. The youngster, Jonathan Shelton, of Brooklyn, was reported holding his own late today following the court-sanctioned action. The youth was operated on for a ruptured appendix and acute peritonitis shortly after he was admitted to the Kings County hospital last week. On Thursday, his condition worsened, and a transfusion was deemed vital. The boy’s mother, Mrs. Hazel Shelton, said she was a member of Jehovah’s witnesses and refused to give permission for the transfusion. She told Hospital authorities that the transferal of blood from the body of one human to another was ’against the laws of God'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">&quot;Wilson D. McKerrow, executive director of the Brooklyn Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, was notified. He petitioned Children’s Court Justice Joseph F. Maguire to give the hospital permission to proceed with the transfusion. The court, at a special session, overruled Mrs. Shelton’s objections on the testimony of four hospital doctors who said that the blood transfer was 'absolutely necessary<sup>1</sup>.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">This case came just six months after another blood transfusion incident involving a child of parents who were Jehovah’s witnesses had attracted nation-wide attention in Chicago. Relative to that case, </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font24"> magazine in its May 22, 1951, issue explained the parents' view as drawn from the Bible and cited the doctor who had attended the mother, Mrs. Rhoda Labrenz, during her pregnancy. This doctor, away on vacation at the time of the forced transfusion on Mrs. Labrenz’ newborn daughter, is reported later to <sub>L</sub> have declared it unnecessary. Critics of Mr. and Mrs. Labrenz were carried away with emotion and surrendered to popular fancy. Shamefully, the clergy led the assault on the parents* devotion to godly principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">•<sub>v</sub> At first sight, press coverage of the Brooklyn ease seemed off to the same start. Deftly ignoring the outrageous encroachment on personal freedom committed, one headline portrayed the court as the savior, leaving the fanatic role to the parent, as it read: &quot;Court Acts to Save Child’s Life as Cultist Mother Balks Doctors.” However, the very article beneath this caption quickly </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">dispels any serious </span><span class="font24">thought that Mrs. Shelton was really guilty of &quot;neglect”. Quoting child cruelty prevention director McKerrow, it went on: <sup>,f</sup> ‘She was obviously a sincere woman and loves the child dearly,* he said today. 'But she insisted that the teachings of Jehovah*s Witnesses hold that it violates the law of God </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font24"> inject the blood of one human being into another. So I served her with a subpoena.**'</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">/ Said another New York paper: &quot;Although McKerrow found that Mrs. Shelton was an ideal mother and kept a scrupulously neat home for her three children, he went into Children’s Court and filed a complaint against her for neglect—a strictly technical charge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">v Some of the scriptures on which Jehovah’s witnesses base their stand in this matter are, briefly, as follows: In Genesis 9:4 and Leviticus 3:17; 7:27; 17:10,11,14, specific prohibitions against eating any manner of blood are given. In regard to &quot;eating”, it should be noted that,feeding intravenously (or through the veins) Is a recognized medical way of taking nourishment, and is &quot;eating” just as surely as feeding through </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font24"> mouth. So sacred did King David consider blood that he refused even to drink water brought to him by men who risked their lives to get it. (1 Chronicles 11:17-19) The Christian Greek Scriptures likewise make clear the divine command on blood. It is exemplified in specific Christian prohibitions in Acts 15:19, 20, 28, 29; 21:25. For those wishing a full and comprehensive discussion of the Biblical aspects of the matter, we suggest their consideration of the </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font24">magazine of July 1, 1951, under the section titled &quot;Questions from Readers”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">TRANSFUSION</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Therapy still in experimental stage</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I</span><span class="font3">N MODERN society science enjoys a privileged position. It occupies the position of a &quot;sacred cow&quot;, and the press, government and clergy pay it homage and do its bidding. It makes loud claims for itself, which the layman, though unable to understand what it is all about, obediently swallows, &quot;hook, line and sinker*”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Medical science is a case in point* Clergy, press and government united early this year to attack a small minority that dared to challenge the omniscience, the infallibility of medicine and its right to make blood transfusions compulsory* To sa^ the least, the practice is still in an experimental stage, and reports keep appearing in the press \vhich indicate that transfusions are not nearly as innocuous, that is, &quot;producing no ill effects,&quot; as the medical fraternity would have us believe* For example, note the following item that appeared in the Chicago [Illinois] </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Tribune,</span><span class="font3"> September 24, 1951:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Tokyo, Sept 23 (AP)—The newspaper yomiuri reported today a Japanese physician has successfully transfused treated animal blood into the veins of more than six hundred patients. Dr. Kumio Kawaishi of Hiroshimo university medical school told a meeting of epidemics researchers in Tokyo that he has used the blood of cows, horses, and pigs to give transfusions to humans—without any serious aftereffects. The physician processes the animal blood with small amounts of formalin and caustic</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">soda and also heats the blood. In one case he said he gave a patient 3,800 cubic centimeters [nearly four quarts] of animal blood over a five-day period without any ill effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Dr. Louis R. Limarzi, head of the hematology department of the University of Illinois medical school and a member of the advisory council of the hematology research foundation, said yesterday a Japanese physician’s transfusion of ‘ animal blood into humans was 'of dubious value’. He said he did not doubt there were no immediate aftereffects from the experiment, but there might be serious long-range effects. 'There’s no telling what the aftereffects might be on the blood and organs over a long period/ he said.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Did this medic ask for permission to thus &quot;experiment&quot; with those 600 patients, and would they have granted him permission if they had known that there might be &quot;serious long-range effects”? Note also that statement: &quot;There’s no telling what the aftereffects might be on the blood and organs over a long period of time/’ for that also applies to the use of human blood. How so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First of all because medical science has not learned all there is to know about blood groups* According to the foremost authorities on blood transfusion, past and present, Landsteiner and Wiener, “an individuality of the blood reminiscent of the* fingerprints is conceivable/* as more and more blood groups are discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First group discovered was the A, B, AB, and O group. Next was the Rh factor. Then followed the MNS group, the P<sub>f </sub>Lewis, Lutheran, Kell-Cellano and Duffy groups. Regarding the last six-named groups, the New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune of </span><span class="font3">April 26, 1951, stated: “They never or only rarely cause transfusion troubles. Trouble is more likely to occur in giving Kell-Cellano blood to someone who doesn’t have that type.” This same article told of the discovery of a ninth group, known as the Kidd-type blood, after the name of the woman whose blood gave the first clue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So, in addition to all Americans having either A, B, AB, or O type blood, in addition to 85 per cent of them having Rh positive and 15 per cent Rh negative blood, etc., etc,, 77 per cent of all Americans are now known to have Kidd-type blood and 23 per cent are without it. If the blood develops antibodies to the Kidd-type blood, as it might easily do because of an incompatible blood transfusion or a pregnancy, then for that Individual to receive Kidd-type blood may mean serious if not fatal consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Experimenting with Atomic Radiation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further proof that the matter of blood transfusion is still in an experimental stage was brought to light at the 1951 annual convention of the American Medical Association at Atlantic City, New Jersey. According to a report published in the New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font3"> June 16, 1951, Burgeons found that the biggest factor in recovery from harm caused by irradiation was not the use of antibiotics or of whole blood, but the protection of the spleen, because “there exists in the spleen of animals a factor essential in the blood-producing mechanism in the bone marrow, and that this factor is destroyed as a result of exposure to radiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Protection of the animals' spleens, Dr. Johnson [the one making these experiments] found, has enabled them to withstand deadly doses of radiations that killed nearly all the animals whose spleens had </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not ~been</span><span class="font3"> protected against radiation.” “ [This] mysterious spleen factor also protects the gastrointestinal tissues which are also severely damaged by radiation exposure,” according to Professor F. C McClean of the University of Chicago, under whose direction the experiments were being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Spleen extract was found to be of great help in overcoming the harmful effects of radiation. ** In the absence of such an agent no active therapy primarily directed at the radiation injury is indicated/ he continued, 'The indiscriminate use of antibiotics and of blood is not only useless, but will actually do harm/ Declaring there is no evidence for the view that mass transfusions of Whole blood would prove a lifesaving specific for radiation, he expressed doubt that mass transfusions could be carried out. A revaluation of the effect of the transfusions of whole blood following irradiation is now being made, he reported.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the foregoing it might well be asked, What’s all the shouting for? alJ the propaganda for stock-piling blood in the case of atomic attacks? On the one hand, thousands of tests have proved that for burns the salt-soda solution drunk is every bit as effective as blood transfusions, if not more so, and here now we learn that for radiation injuries, which manifest themselves usually after the second week in the form of infections, hemorrhages and anemia, whole “blood is not only useless, but will actually do harm”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nor can blood transfusions be considered as being beyond the experimental</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">stage so long as the hepatitis virus<sup>1</sup> and the yellow jaundice germs lurk in blood. An INS news dispatch of May 23, 1951, had the following to report regarding this matter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A Niagara Falls mother of five children filed a $110,562 claim against the federal government today on the ground her husband died in 1949 as a result of infusion of blood plasma infected with yellow jaundice germs. The plaintiff is Mrs. Dorothea G. Hidy, who is acting as administratrix of the estate of her husband, George A. Hidy, She alleges the plasma was supplied by the War Assets Administration. The complaint charges the plasma was sent by the state health department to the Niagara Falls Memorial Hospital. The W.A.A., now merged with other federal agencies, supplied the plasma to the state health unit, Hidy died three days after receiving an injection of 500 centimeters. Mrs. Hidy alleged negligence against the federal government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the foregoing, what inconsistency on the part of the medical profession to secure legal sanctions in forcing blood transfusions! Being forced to be guinea pigs is the lot of those who dwell in totalitarian states, but should hardly be the lot of those dwelling in a democratic land. And in the celebrated Labrenz case there was an even more important issue involved, that of freedom of worship. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century</span><span class="font3"> of June 13, 1951, commenting on the religious aspect of this matter, had a pertinent editorial, which we here give in full:</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Transfusion Case to Be Fought by Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jehovah’s witnesses have another tough case on its way to the Supreme Court. It grows out of the recent action of a Chicago judge in taking an infant, Cheryl Labrenz, from her parents, members of the Witnesses, in order that doctors might give her a blood transfusion, which, they testified, could alone save her life. The Witnesses hold blood transfusions to be a violation of Scriptural injunctions against eating or drinking blood. The child was taken into custody by the court, given the transfusion, responded well, and is now said to be physically and mentally normal. She is still technically under the court’s control, but was returned to her parents a few days after the transfusion had been given. The father states that when a Dr. Bowman of Bethany hospital, Chicago, who had taken care of Mrs. Labrenz throughout her pregnancy but was absent from the city at the time of the baby’s birth, returned to Chicago after the transfusion had been given, he said there was no medical necessity for the transfusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“But the case-as Jehovah’s Witnesses are preparing it will rest on other grounds. Has a court the right to take a child from its parents on medical testimony and force them to submit to what they consider a sinful act? Or is the control of children by parents an inviolate right under our system of government? Long ago the courts held that the community has a right to force, vaccination of the children of Christian Scientists, although this legal decision has become a dead letter in many communities. That ruling, however, rests on the power of the community to protect itself against epidemics. There was no such potential danger in the Labrenz case. What are the limits of parental control? And what of state power? Can the state force decent, law-abiding parents to surrender a child to its disposition on the basis of medical advice? If the courts rule in the affirmative, a precedent may be set which could have far-reaching and disturbing consequences.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By &quot;AwtAtl&quot; wrwpondunt</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> in AvitrnHa</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font24">USTRALIA’S present commonwealth government was elected in 1950 chiefly on its promise to oust communism. Thereafter a bill was passed which aimed principally at the legal dissolution of the Communist party; but it was declared unconstitutional by six of Australia’s seven High Court justices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Last April, Prime Minister Menzies again focused election issues on the Communist party and was returned to power with control of the Senate and a slightly reduced majority in the House of Representatives. Two months later he sought transfer to the commonwealth government the states&quot; powers to legislate against the Communist party, but two states, New South Wales and Queensland^ refused. In July the prime minister sought restoration of powers formerly in the scrapped anti-Red law, But the Labor party objected and the issue was taken to the people in a referendum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The opposition made the stand that ratification of such powers would be tantamount to restoring a law which the High Court had declared unconstitutional. Further, they struck hard at the folly of giving Parliament the power to say who are ’‘Communists”, The </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">term</span><span class="font24"> “Communist”,, they argued, might be extended to include anticommunists who favored any form of social organization. Another danger lay in the fact that Parliament could confer on its agents and officers unlimited rights to -search homes </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font24"> persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">For its case, the government argued that the six state governments already possessed the power they asked for the central government. They stressed pointedly that Australians should rouse themselves to the realization that the war danger was impending and grave. They asked whether there was any doubt that agents communicating with world Communist organizations should be dealt with. Spokesmen said the government sought a general power to control Communists on defense and security grounds and a particular power to introduce anew the Communist outlaw measure scrapped by the High Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Prime Minister Menzies paid much attention </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font24"> the opposition argument that the power to define Communists might be used capriciously. To his aid came the Sydney </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Herald,</span><span class="font24"> a leading Australian daily, declaring: “Does anybody seriously imagine that a church or a Trade Union or the archbishop of Sydney come within any reasonable definition of Communists or Communism?*’</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">of course, most persons accepted</span><span class="font24"> the logic that a “church” or &quot;archbishop*<sup>1</sup> would probably not be endangered by such powers in government hands. But there was a concern for some minority groups whose tenets might </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font24"> unpopular. Some in the past have had trying times with Menzies’ legislation, For example, Jehovah’s witnesses were banned under a Menzies’ law in 1941—a law described by one High Court justice as “arbitrary, capricious, and oppressive”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">In the torrid campaign that followed, not even the clergy could keep out for long. Dr, Burgmann, bishop of Canberra, opened the parade with a warning against the government's proposal. Though criticized for introducing sectarianism into politics, he was quickly followed by a host of clergymen sympathetic to his views. Bishop Pilcher of the Church of England gave many “personal” reasons for a “Yes” vote' Not to be outdone, Cardinal Gilroy of the Catholic Church came as close as he apparently dared to urging a government vote when he said: “Whatever the Referendum result the government should take quick and effective action to deal with communism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Thus did tension mount as both </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">parties went </span><span class="font24">noisily after their goals right down to the finish line. Only the Communists remained ominously quiet, though one reliable newspaper reported that the Australian Communist party had spent £100,000 on propaganda. Then at last, the vote. By September 24 final results showed the government’s referendum defeated by a mere handful out of more than five mil Ji on votes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The public press world-wide seemed generally pleased with the report it could make to readers. Tersely, the Manchester observed: “if Mr. Menzies complains that this refusal compels him to fight the Communists with one hand behind his back, it is a fail comment that his government has not made much use </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font24"> Rs free hand hitherto.”</span></p>

He received them courteously, but granted them permission to remain only one month, pending consideration by his superiors of their request to remain indefinitely, Assured, however, that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the permission, the four missionaries proceeded to Penang, a little island port on the northwest coast of Malaya having a population of 200,000. Here they found the people unusually hospitable and anxious to know more about the Bible, of which they knew very little. True, most of the people are Buddhists, but they were ready enough to hear about a God who will make an end of all corruption, violence, and disunity in this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each week the missionaries inquired at the Immigration department in Penang If permission for permanent stay had been received, but there was none. Would Malaya, now clamoring for independence and anxious to show its governmental maturity, give a decision in favor of freedom of worship? Would she go along with the free democratic policies of tho United Nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Would she permit this Bible educational work, the greatest force for combating godless communism, to be carried on in her land? Or would Malaya follow, in the footsteps of the Communist countries and prohibit the entry of Jehovah’s witnesses? These questions were soon to be answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tragic Blunder on the Highest Level</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On July 10 the offices of the Watch Tower Society in Singapore received word from the Immigration department stating that the missionaries would have to '‘depart on or before the 12th of July”, but this information had not reached them when, on July 11, in response to a request, the missionaries appeared for an interview before a Mr. A. B. Roche, controller of immigration for the Federation of Malaya in .Penang. Playing the part assigned to him by some higher authority, Roche brusquely asked for their passports, noted the date, and remarked: “H’m, you have left it rather late. You should be away by now.” He was reminded that no word as of that moment had been received concerning their request to remain. Whereupon, Roche declared: &quot;Well, I can give you your answer now. I shall not grant you your request.” He then proceeded to dictate letters addressed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> the missionaries in which he refused their request to remain, quoting as authority for his summary action the Federation of Malaya Emergency Regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now these Emergency Regulations were special powers granted for the express purpose of combating banditry and communism. Therefore the missionaries asked why Roche was taking this summary action, to which he curtly replied: “I don’t wish to give a reason.” What an outrage! Had they somehow fallen behind the Iron Curtain? They thought they were still in the camp of the Western world, yet they were receiving the kind of highhanded treatment dealt out by petty officials in the totalitarian lands. It is a well-known fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are neither bandits nor communists in any sense of the word, and yet an antibandit, anticommunist regulation was being used against them without cause or reason. It was therefore manifest that these low, underhanded methods were being employed to protect wicked conspirators behind the scenes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Asked if they could appeal his decision, Roche first replied, &quot;Well, there isn’t any appeal really.” But when pressed further on the point he unearthed a copy of the regulation which contained a clause granting the right to appeal to the chief secretary. Here was at least a ray of hope; so immediately an appeal was taken up to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaya. Possibly the chief secretary, Mr, M. V. del Tufo, was an honest, sensible man, wise enough to see that justice would be handed out in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">No Relief from Council of the Wicked</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in Kuala Lumpur that the missionaries learned the real significance of Roche’s statement, “There isn’t any appeal really.” Not from pillar to post, as the saying goes, but from pawn to pawn the missionaries went seeking relief from the gross injustice committed against them. Given the run-around from one official to another they met a variety of excuses why no responsible official would grant an interview. In an effort to see the chief secretary, they got no farther than his office staff. A call on the secretary to the government, Mr. P. O. Wickens, who had something to do with the formal written appeal that was made, likewise proved fruitless. Told that Mr. Dato Onn, Member for Home Affairs, was actually the one that dealt with such matters, they made efforts to see him, but here again one could only talk to his private secretary. An interview with Dato Onn was refused on the grounds that the matter was beyond his power to reverse, the decision having been made at government level. Now what could that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dato Onn’s secretary was a kindly disposed man and so he revealed what all this dodging by the officials really meant. On July 3, this secretary explained, the Executive Council of the Federation resolved that ‘the future policy of the Federation of Malaya would be that representatives of the Watch Tower Society, that is, Jehovah’s witnesses, would be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">personae non gratae</span><span class="font5"> [persons not welcome] in the Federation, and that this would apply to the four missionaries now making application to stay'. So the matter was important, important enough to engage the attention of the whole' Council in private, but not important enough for a single member to grant an interview to the ones concerned, the ones who were being grossly misrepresented, viciously charged, falsely classified as undesirables, and wickedly condemned without a hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The instigators of this conspiracy sought to do a thorough job in choking out the message of God’s kingdom from the territory of Malaya. They wanted no public discussion on the matter, no appeals that might backfire and expose the plotters. They therefore struck at the highest level where they exercised influence and power in order that the decision would be final with the minimum of publicity. Even the little notice that did appear in the press was enough to call forth an expression of displeasure from more than one official.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. One is reminded of Jesus’ words, that they that practice vile things hate the light and avoid it if possible for fear their evil deeds will be exposed.—John 3:19-21, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As matters now stood the only person in Malaya powerful enough to overrule or modify this decree of the Executive Council was the high commissioner in Council, Sir Henry Gurney, and so a formal “Petition of Appeal” was filed with him. In pleading that this stupid error be corrected, the Petition gave the following reasons: “(1) Your Petitioners believe that the work done by them in helping those who wish to understand the Bible brings great benefits and enjoins upon all people obligations of justice, decency, morality and respect for law and order, and belief in God’s justice and the hope of the new world promised by the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ (ii) That, in their short stay in Penang, your petitioners have met many people who have expressed a real appreciation of the aid rendered by your Petitioners in helping them to understand the Bible, and would greatly regret the denial of such service to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ (lii) That your Petitioners, being dedicated to the service of God, deem it their bounden duty to respond to the call for world-wide preaching as contained in the Biblical command: ’This good news of the kingdom shall be preached to all nations.' (Matthew 24:14) Having freely practiced their preaching work for many years in their own country, where they were assisted by thousands of associates, your Petitioners now wish to bring this good news to the people of Malaya, that no country may be excluded from the benefits of the divine command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(iv) That your Petitioners believe that a sound knowledge of the Bible is the most lasting and effective bulwark against the dangerous and violent political ideologies that teach the overthrow of states and the alteration of the systems by violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(v) That your Petitioners believe that the remarkable unity and peace which exists between Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth, regardless of race,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">nationality and colour, demonstrates in a practical way the benefits gained as a result of the teachings of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society,” Even as the other appeals went unheeded, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">so also this cry to the</span><span class="font5"> high commissioner in behalf of truth and justice. It fell on stony ears with the same result—no interview, no reason, no relief. All possibilities for a stay of execution of the Executive Council's order were now exhausted. All officialdom of Malaya apparently was solidly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">against Jehovah God and</span><span class="font5"> his Kingdom witnesses. The only door open for the four missionaries was the one through which they had entered. They must leave this land where intolerance had reared its ugly head and go to one where freedom of worship exists. So on August 27 the four left narrow-minded Malaya and entered freedom-loving Thailand, and there they have continued </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font5"> charitable. God-given ministerial work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kou </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Too Can. Protest!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does this mean the case is closed and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the matter</span><span class="font5"> ended? Official Malaya may think so. And the conspirators who engineered the plot may sit back and rejoice that Jehovah’s witnesses were tossed out and the door slammed against their return. But such totalitarian treatment settles nothing. When freedom and liberty are crushed underfoot as here In Malaya, all lovers of truth and justice everywhere </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">rise</span><span class="font5"> up with righteous indignation to meet the challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The government gave no reason for the ousting of Jehovah’s witnesses, but one high official told the missionaries: “You are undermining and disturbing all the established religions, which are such a bulwark against communism.&quot; This is a revealing statement when considered with other events. For example, a clergyman of the “Brethren” church in Penang told his congregation to have nothing to do with the witnesses when they called at their homes. Also the “Rev.” A. J. Bullitt, of Newcastle, commissary for the bishop of Singapore, complained that a newspaper headline, “Missionaries Asked </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to Leave </span><span class="font5">Malaya,’’ was misleading since Jehovah’s witnesses were not real missionaries. He then boasted that a score of new missionaries were on their way to Malaya, ten assigned to the Church Missionary Society, six to the English Presbyterian Mission, and four to the London Missionary Society.—Singapore Free Press, August 13, 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The true nature of the ouster is thus discovered—religious discrimination and bigoted intolerance! Political leaders have suppressed the Kingdom message and impaled its proclaimers at the behest of Pharisaical advisers. But in listening to these blind religious guides what a stupid blunder the rulers of Malaya have made! Christendom's leading religions are no bulwark against communism. That is why the religions of Christendom make leagues with communism in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Russia, etc., while Jehovah’s uncompromising witnesses are outlawed, banned and thrown into concentration camps in those countries. So by closing her borders to these true Christians, Malaya is playing right into the hands of the Communists. So it was too bad that those “established religions” in Malaya could not provide a sufficient “bulwark” to prevent Malaya’s high commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney, from being ambushed and killed by a hail of bullets by Communists just two and a half months later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through dullness of understanding men may make mistakes, but if they want to be wise they will correct their errors. Surely some of the ill-advised officials of Malaya are wise enough to reconsider the tragic mistake that was made in classifying Jeho-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">vah’s witnesses as undesirables. Let every freedom-loving person therefore write immediately to these officials. Write briefly and to the point, urging them to correct this error. Show them there are thousands upon thousands of people in this world who vigorously protest against this clergy-inspired discrimination and ruthless intolerance shown by Malaya, Names and addresses of responsible men of influence are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">‘is Satan Necessary?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">IERE are many professing Christians who do not believe that Satan the Devil actually exists. Says one of these: “Life is not a battle between God and the Devil God has no rival, save as man himself lifts his spirit in disobedience to the Divine will and purpose.” Not understanding why God has permitted Satan to exist, this one argues that Satan does not exist. However, not only is his position contrary to Biblical testimony but it offers no explanation of why a righteous Deity would tolerate man's rebellion and his inflicting so much inhumanity upon his neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Posing pertinent questions but not having their answers is “Right Reverend” R. J. Renison, who, under the heading “Is Satan Necessary?” has, among other things, the following to say: “The problem of evil is the greatest riddle in history. . .. Probably there has never been a time when so many people have been trying to find the answer as now. The late war was surely one of the greatest evils in our human history. . . . How can man say that God is love, when he contemplates the cynical evil which still threatens to destroy civilization?” However, this clergyman would have us believe that such “words about the responsibility of God are not only unchristian but foolish”. He holds that the problem is to harmonize the “omnipotence of God” with the “freedom of the human mind”. To do this, we are told, would solve “the mystery of human existence”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God, knowing that his inquiring human creatures would want to know</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the purpose of their existence, as well as why God has tolerated evil and the Devil himself, provided the answers in his Word, the Bible, Therein we read that God created the earth to abide forever, to be inhabited and that man was commissioned to populate the earth, exercise dominion over the lower animals and turn the entire earth into a paradise. God having purposed this, it will be accomplished.—Genesis 1:26-28; Ecclesiastes 1:4; Isaiah 45:18; 55:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To aid man in realizing the purpose of his existence by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">carrying</span><span class="font5"> out God’s purpose regarding the earth, God appointed an unnamed cherub as guardian of the first human pair, Adam and Eve. This cherub became ambitious to be worshiped like Jehovah God and so he set about to alienate the affections of Adam and Eve by depicting to Eve that God was withholding </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font5"> things from her. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yielding to </span><span class="font5">selfishness, Eve turned against God and induced Adam to join her. Succeeding with the first human pair, this cherub, now Satan the Devil, boasted that he could turn all creatures away from God. (Genesis 3; Ezekiel 28:12-19) Centuries later Satan also succeeded in turning aside some of the angels.—Genesis 6:1,2; 2 Peter 2:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first two chapters of the book of Job furnish the key to the understanding of the riddle as to the permission of Satan and evil. There we read that God asked Satan if that one had noticed God’s servant Job, a perfect and upright man. The very fact that God called Satan’s attention to Job’s integrity argues that the question of man’s integrity had been previously raised. The rest of the book shows Job vindicating Jehovah’s side by maintaining integrity in spite of pressure.—Job 42:7-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This same truth, as to why God permits the wicked to exist and the righteous to suffer, is brought to our attention </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in God's </span><span class="font5">dealing with Pharaoh. Jehovah could have instantly wiped out Pharaoh and his hosts and set the Israelites free. Why did he not do so? He tells us: “For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, so that you would have been effaced from the earth; but </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">this is why I</span><span class="font5"> have spared you: to show you my power, and to have my fame recounted throughout all the earth.” (Exodus 9:15,16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font5"> In that prophetic drama Moses foreshadowed Christ Jesus; and Pharaoh, Satan the Devil. —Exodus 14:8, 9, 27, 28; Acts 3:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That Satan the Devil did make himself a rival to Jehovah God is apparent from his words found at Isaiah 14:12-14, “I will be like the most High.” And that his consuming ambition is to be worshiped like Jehovah God is apparent from the third temptation he presented to Jesus in the wilderness: “So he brought him up and showed him </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all the kingdoms of the inhabited</span><span class="font5"> earth in an instant of time; and the Devil said to him: *1 will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.’ ” No doubt the apostle Paul had in mind this ambitious inclination of Satan the Devil when he stated that Jesus gave no consideration to becoming equal to God.—Luke 4:5-7; Matthew 4:8-11; Philippians 2:5-11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True, God is love. (1 John 4:8) But he is also omniscient, and therefore he knew that it was best to have this issue of supremacy raised by the Devil settled once and for all, and so God has permitted evil and the Devil to continue, even though it has resulted in much hardship to members of the human race. This, however, has been no injustice on God’s part, for the human family brought this condition upon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">itself. God is therefore not obligated to</span><span class="font5"> extricate mankind at all. But because Jehovah God is love and loves righteousness, he has provided a way of relief for all lovers of righteousness. Life is a blessing even under present conditions, and especially is this so in view of the hope of the resurrection and the new world.—Matthew 5:45; John 5:28, 29; 2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that new world all that have breath will praise Jehovah and nothing will hurt nor destroy. God’s will will be done on earth as it is done in heaven. To bring about such a condition will not require depriving man of his freedom of mind, of his free moral agency. Why not? Because God rules by love. Yes, He appeals to man’s love, to man’s sense of gratitude, and if man has love in his heart he will of his own free will show that by obeying God’s commandments. If he does not thus express gratitude he will cease receiving such benefits, that is, cease to exist. Thus God will have a universe of intelligent creatures willingly obeying him out of love and doing so as implicitly as the lower animals heed the instincts God has placed in them and as the inanimate creation, the sun, moon and stars, etc., obey his “laws of nature*’ —Psalm 107:1,8,43; 150:6; Isaiah 11:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we see that God did not create the Devil nor is the Devil necessary to God, but God has permitted the Devil to exist toprove in God’s favor the issue of who is supreme, and to prove the Devil a liar. When that is accomplished God will make an end to the Devil, as well as all evil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">SCIENCE DIGEST</span><span class="font3"> January, 1952, carried an article with the intriguing title, &quot;Fish to Man—in an Hour!” Though apparently calculated to inject new life into the quaking evolution theory, it proves a lethal shot showing the uselessness of trying to cling to both evolution and common sense,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ &quot;As everyone knows . . . “” the article begins, in typical evolutionistic style. Certainly only those who swallow evolution in its entirety without question stand the faintest chance of gobbling down the &quot;proof” that is to follow. In a new twist, the writer appeals to insulin shock therapy. For some cases of personality disorder, patients are placed in a deep coma by an injection of insulin. Then, at the desired time, an injection of glucose starts them on the way back to consciousness. During this process the patient displays certain behavior patterns which the article asserts are throwbacks to subhuman evolutionary stages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ For example, first muscular reaction is noted in “more or less even, rhythmic movements of the arms and legs”. This is likened to the &quot;swimming” movements of the primary fish stage—why, what else? Next, watch while the four limbs begin to move more unevenly in an alternating action. This, the writer exults, must represent “the low creep’ of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">primitive, animal-like nature”. On land now, there can be no stopping our evolution upward. Now place a pencil or similar object under the fingers or toes. They close around it! Now do not be an ignoramus and dismiss this as natural reflex action. Surely you see [ the deeper significance: now we are apes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But hurry along now, who wants to be an ape </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> his life? Soon there come forth from the patient what the writer calls “certain dull, weird, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noises”. Then the sounds</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">' become more human &quot;which”, the article says, &quot;if heard in a baby, we would designate as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">babbling,</span><span class="font3"> for such it really is!” In conclusion, we are told, the patient has &quot;relived </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eons</span><span class="font3"> of time&quot;, spanning the entire evolutionary arc from fish to man in one hour!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ The article comes forth from modern man, yet is full of “certain dull, weird, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">non-human </span><span class="font3">noises”. We would not expect to hear such unreasonable talk from a baby, but wherever ' it originated, we would at once designate it [ &quot;as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">babbling,</span><span class="font3"> for such it really is!” No wonder Arthur N.

<p><span class="font8">E</span><span class="font5">VERYONE recognizes these words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With them Abraham Lincoln opened one of history's best-known public speech’s, the Gettysburg Address. Many have sven forgotten that this two-minute gem of oratory was but second billing that November 19, 1863, at Gettysburg. Lincoln’s 'few appropriate remarks” followed a two-hour effort by the renowned Edward Everett.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Time has played a favorite trick on Lin-join, cloaking his famous address with an unexpected amount of legend and lore. The schoolboy conception is that he scrawled out his first and final form of the talk while on route by train to Gettysburg. However, here are in existence five drafts of the speech in Lincoln’s own handwriting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It appears that after weeks of consider-ition, the president drew up the first draft it the White House. What he made on the xain was but a revision of the original, md this too was improved upon the night tefore its delivery, which time the author</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ago”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">spent at the home of Judge Wills in Gettysburg. On the nforning of the event, Lincoln made the final draft which he used on the occasion, and from which J a ter </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">copies </span><span class="font5">were taken, providing the accepted authorized version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is likewise difficult to establish exactly how the audience received the address. Again, popular fancy has held that the listeners were caught in a moment of stunned silence, unable to even offer applause. It is truly quite conceivable that the combination of brevity, power, beauty and expressiveness present could have accomplished such an effect. Furthermore, some reports confirm this. But others differ, saying the audience responded in a “tumultuous outpouring’<sup>1</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But whatever the audience reaction, Edward Everett’s note to Lincoln afterward speaks for itself: “I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion in two hours as you did in two minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">Divinity Dean Thinks Churches Need House Cleaning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“ Dr. Liston Pope, dean of Yale University’s Divinity School, takes a dim view of the churches* stand on race equality. On December 12, 1951, he addressed a joint session of two agencies of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A, and hit hard at this weakness. The racial point, he asserted, was one of the paramount issues in the world-wide war of ideologies; and he urged “a better demonstration of racial equality than the Soviet can produce’*. Dr. Pope claimed that other fields including politics, sports, education, trade unions and industry outstripped religion in eliminating race prejudice* He charged that less than </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3"> per cent of professedly Christian congregations in the United States maintained membership rolls of mixed racial groups, and declared succinctly: &quot;The churches have a lot of house cleaning to do before they can call themselves Christians.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">' In a New York sermon during December, 1951, &quot;Rev.” Dr* Allen E. Claxton asserted that people in desperate circumstances were more interested in retribution than &quot;integrity, unselfishness, * . * brotherly love”. He discounted the value of “a spectacular leader or dictator&quot; to remedy ills, and said: &quot;The real way to redeem our world and establish righteousness in the nation, justice among races and peace In the world is by following the apiritual principles to be found in the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount*’*</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>No Peace, No Progress</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; Publicity, newspaper headlines and flowing speeches surrounded recent U. N* disarmament discussions, but the results again showed the miser* able failure of world leaders to achieve the peace and better c o n d 11 i o n s they continually promise. The same conflicting positions were taken when the U,N* began discussion of A-bomb control five and a half years ago that were taken during the December disarmament talks in Paris. In sixty-six months there has been not only no solution, but no progress toward it* The East and West merely agree that they disagree* The only point of agreement was on the establishment of a new 12-member disarmament commission, but they could not agree on what it is to do* A U, N. guard in Paris commented about the sheet metal translator s' booths, &quot;As soon as the disarmament talks are over, the French can rip out the booths and use them to make tanks.&quot;</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Looking Back on Ten Years</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; Ten years have passed since Japan attacked Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) bringing the U* S* into World War II* Look at the changes since then* Allies are enemies, enemies allies. Germany, Italy and Japan, enemies of Britain and the ILS., are now allies being rebuilt with U, S* funds* Russia and China, former allies of Britain and the U, S., today are enemies. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Austria, &quot;liberated&quot; from shackles of Nazism, now grovel under shackles of communism, Adolescents of the Nazi Youth movement are now leaders of the Communist Youth movement in East Germany* In Austria and Romania the Communists had little trouble in securing as public prosecutors judges who did the same work for former totalitarians. The sound of practice for battle, war noises heard today at Pearl Harbor, are not echoes of 1941, but are in preparation for more conflicts* One totalitarian foe was defeated, another sprang up. When one unjust ruler is conquered, another replaces him. It has been so throughout history. The methods used to bring about peace have not been sufficient. What is missing? Faith in God and his kingdom to remove the wicked, superhuman influence of Satan, who continually keeps earth in turmoil.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Tax Scandal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The succession of scandals in government has reached the point where many people now ignore the almost uninterrupted parade-of &quot;flve-percenters”, &quot;influence peddlers&quot; and “fixers&quot;, but with the federal budget taking more than 20 per cent of the national income, such graft is of vital concern. In the tax scandal six of the 64 internal revenue collectors were dismissed or resigned; 46 other employees were suspended; Charles Oliphant, the department's chief counsel, resigned. T. Lamar Caudle, in charge of tax <sub>h</sub> prosecutions, was fired for outside activities “incompatible” with government work. Though Truman has announced intention to act against corruption, he has made himself politically vulnerable by waiting bo long. Yet many of his political opponents are themselves filled with more of a zeal for votes than for righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The U. S* is far from the only country with such conditions* In Russia Prauda said (12/18) the bureau that produces equipment for retail trade did &quot;legitimatize unjustified expenditures and waste state funds for nothing&quot;, that in 1949 it spent 500,000 rubles in designing, but only 80,000 rubles' worth of projects were put into production*</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Is McCarthy Reliable?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">John Stewart Service, a U* S* diplomat for 18 years, was cleared seven times on investigations of his loyalty, when a “reasonable doubt” could have caused his dismissal* On an eighth investigation, the “reasonable doubt” was expressed (12/13), Service was dismissed, and Senator McCarthy exclaimed, &quot;Good, good, good! It should be remembered that ... I forced the recall of Service from the Far East [while] the State Department [said he was] one of their most valued and trusted experts,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Despite hi? elation over finally seeing a “reasonable doubt” raised about one of his multitudinous accusations, it is well to keep in mind that McCarthy has not had the Department of Justice prosecute his 205 (more</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">or less) alleged &quot;card-carrying Communists&quot; &quot;members of a spy ring&quot; in the government. Until he does, the charge “McCarthyism*<sup>1</sup> will continue to apply to unfounded, unproved, irresponsible charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Strife in Iran</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">&lt;$&gt; Why did 32 opposition members of Iran’s parliament move, with bedclothes, baggage and servants, into a wing of the parliament building? Because Iran’s Parliament has traditionally provided a sanctuary and they wanted to dramatize their charge that Premier Mossadegh was using violence and &quot;government gangsters&quot; against them. Mossadegh argued, however, that mass demonstrations in his favor showed he did not have to resort to such violence. It was promised that forthcoming Iranian elections would be free, but just before the opposition was to have broadcast a charge that the polls would be a mockery, radio privileges were denied them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Nationalism in Asia</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">&lt;$&gt; Premier Mossadegh of Iran, at first considered a fanatic, has become “the Patrick Henry of the whole Middle East, merely the first of a league of rebels proclaiming a war of independence from Alexandria to the Gulf of Oman&quot; said the British Manchester </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font24"> (10/18). The growth of this strife is evident in Egypt where a “holy war” has been called for against British control of the Suez Canal; in Iran over the oil fields and where 5 were killed, more than 200 injured in a Red-led riot (12/6); and elsewhere in the Middle East. Too many people, too little food, tiny wealthy ruling cliques, money badly spent by grasping politicians, mass poverty, new political ideas sweeping in,* such la the story of much of Asia today. Even financial aid plans face the difficult problem of seeing that the aid goes to the right goals instead of to ruling classes, who themselves must be numbered among the exploiters of the Middle East,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">An Underlying Cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">“ Fighting continues in French Indo-China. Red bands in Malaya harass the government. In the Philippines the bartie against Huk rebels continues. Communist led? Yes, but the extreme poverty of Asia gives communists and nationalists alike sufficient arguments to incite violent opposition </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">against Asia’s</span><span class="font24"> rulers. Note this&quot; compartsion of population and income:</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Population Income </span><span class="font24">Asia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53% &nbsp;&nbsp;10.5%</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">West Europe 12.8% &nbsp;&nbsp;22.8%</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">North America 9% &nbsp;&nbsp;43.6%</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Tragedy in the Philippines</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">As if days of unexpected, death-dealing volcanic eruption on Caimguin island In the central Philippines were not enough, during the rescue operations it was lashed by the combined fury of a typhoon, floods and landslides. A “state of public calamity** was proclaimed after the total dead and missing reached 2.714, the homeless 100,000. According to .Time magazine (12/17) “tranquil elders on the tiny Philippine island of Camlguin** tell the people such natural catastrophes are “because God had been displeased by younger Camiguenos who grew lax in their churchgoing, forgetful of the feast days and neglectful of the sign of the cross&quot;. Blaming God for this catastrophe and trying to force feast days (not a command for Christians) and the </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font24"> of the </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">cross (a pagan, </span><span class="font24">not a Christian symbol) on superstitious natives is blasphemy on its very face. The Bible shows that world’s woes result from the “god of this world”, Satan, not from the Creator, and that soon under the blessings of Jehovah’s righteous kingdom earth will return to the perfect state of the Garden of Eden and such catastrophes will cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">China’s Beds Demand Ransom </span><span class="font24">&lt;$&gt; There are almost 80,000 Chinese-Americans living in the U. S. and recently nearly 60 per cent of them have received urgent requests for money from relatives in China. Most of these were connected with threats that the relatives would be imprisoned, beaten, tortured, or killed if the money did not come. Between $4 and $5 </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">million has been sent to </span><span class="font24">China, $1,000,000 from New York within juat four weeks. The racket is endless, for, as when dealing with other gangsters, those who </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">sent money </span><span class="font24">got demands for more. Attempting to present a solid front to end this blackmail, the Treasury banned all payments to Red China (12/9) on the basis of the Trading with the Enemy law of World War I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Claimed ‘Proof’ of</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Apostolic Succession </span><span class="font24"> “A committee of eminent archaeologists’* began the news report on who said what about Peter’s tomb as being in Rome under the Vatican (12/19). These men said they found masonry walls, largely gone, but with enough remaining to know a tomb had existed. The report said the name Peter is scratched on walls of adjacent buildings (which Peter?) and coins from about the same time were lying around. The reports were written to sound as though bones found nearby might have been an apostle's, but they had to admit there was no proof for this. The news report further said, </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">“The whole line</span><span class="font24"> of papal succession may be held to hinge upon this point,” Yet the most reliable religious authority, the Bible, indicates the apostles would </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">not have successors.</span><span class="font24"> Even if they did, and were the popes such successors, then the pope*s church</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">would be expected to hold to the apostles’ teachings Instead of flouting them by using images, celebrating masses, teaching purgatory, meddling in world politics.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>View on Vatican Ambassador</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">4* Two interesting facts came to light from a December Gallup Poll on the proposed appointment of an ambassador to the Vatican. Point one: the number of people against It, Point two: the number knowing so little about world conditions they did not even know about it The poll showed: opposed, 29 per cent; in favor, 19 per cent; no opinion, 12 per cent; had not heard about it, 40 per </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cent.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Up the Orinoco</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3"> The Orinoco river, 1,500 miles long, second only to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Amazon in South America, runs through a vast, wild, unexplored territory, a thing unimaginable to many modem men. Last summer an expedition headed for Its source in the mountain barrier between Brazil and Venezuela. It faced insects, man-eating fish, disease and unfriendly Indians. By late summer it reached Esmeraldis, a mission station, the uppermost river settlement. Its source, 300 miles farther, was reached (12/9) and reported to be about 35 miles east of the previously determined location. If this is correct, it will, even in this remote section, change the national boundary between Brazil and Venezuela.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Blessed New World</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3"> The world is not too happy these days, with wars, threats of wars, anxiety and frustration, religious falsehood and moral bankruptcy. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century</span><span class="font3"> (12/19) ridiculed the idea In a recent magazine that “the blessed new world which somehow eluded mankind after World War I and World War II would come after World War III&quot;. World War H was to bring &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;, yet according to the National Geographic Society (12/12) the world now has from 30 to 60 million refugees. Would a third world war bring better conditions? Or will that “blessed new world&quot; come in the manner God's Word says it will, through the direct intervention of Jehovah God and the abolition of Satan, the instigator of wickedness? Accept God's promise, it is of more value than those made by politicians.</span></p>
