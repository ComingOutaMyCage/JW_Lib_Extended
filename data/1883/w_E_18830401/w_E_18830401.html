<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Lord is granting us much to encourage us lately, and no doubt his all-wise eye saw the time encouragements were most needed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nothing encourages us more than the excellent letters which daily come to hand in great numbers.  It is pleasant to hear from those freshly interested in the truth, as a newly-found treasure long hid, even though we realize that some may be &quot;stony-ground&quot; hearers, who have not much root, and when persecution or distress ariseth, because of the Word, by and by may be offended and wither away as rapidly as they sprung up.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is specially encouraging to hear of those who are growing both in grace and knowledge, enduring hardness, trials, persecutions; as good soldiers, fighting the good fight of faith, and laying hold on eternal life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There could be no better evidence of progress and searching for truth than the many orders constantly coming in for the helps to study--a desire to take advantage of the various helps which seem to be providentially provided now.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE SON OF GOD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The character of our Lord Jesus Christ has not only been the admiration of all his true disciples and followers since he passed that wonderful life narrated by the evangelists, but it has often been the theme of wonder and approbation on the part of many who were never ranked among his devoted adherents. It is only our purpose in this brief article to quote some of these expressions of admiration and praise as they have been drawn from different ones in contemplating the divine nature and character of the Son of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The oft-quoted and well-known eulogy of Rousseau, shows how he esteemed that perfect personage who is the subject of gospel narrative, as well as what impressions those extraordinary narratives made upon his mind.  He says:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;How petty are the books of the philosophers, with all their pomp, compared with the Gospels!  Can it be that writings at once so sublime and so simple are the work of men?  Can he whose life they tell be himself no more than a man?  Is there anything in his character of the enthusiast or the ambitious sectary?  What sweetness, what purity in his ways, what touching grace in his teachings!  What a loftiness in his maxims; what profound wisdom in his words!  What presence of mind, what delicacy and aptness in his replies! What an empire over his passions! Where is the man, where is the sage, who knows how to act, to suffer, and to die without weakness, and without display? My friends, men do not invent like this; and the facts respecting Socrates, which no one doubts, are not so well attested as those about Jesus Christ. These Jews could never have struck this tone, or thought of this morality, and the Gospel has characteristics of truthfulness so grand, so striking, so perfectly inimitable, that their inventors would be even more wonderful than he whom they portray.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">On one occasion Napoleon said: &quot;From first to last Jesus is the same; always the same--majestic and simple, infinitely severe and infinitely gentle. Throughout a life passed under the public eye he never gives occasion to find fault.  The prudence of his conduct compels our admiration by its union of force and gentleness.  Alike in speech and action, he is enlightened, consistent, and calm.  Sublimity is said to be an attribute of divinity: what name then, shall we give him in whose character was united every element of the sublime? I know men, and I tell you Jesus was not a man.  Everything in him amazes me.  Comparison is impossible between him and any other being in the world. He is truly a being by himself.  His ideas and his sentiments, the truth that he announces, his manner of convincing, are all beyond humanity and the natural order of things.  His birth, and the story of his life; the profoundness of his doctrine, which overturns all difficulties, and is their most complete solution; his Gospel, the singularity of his mysterious being, his appearance, his empire, his progress through all centuries and kingdoms--all this is to me a prodigy, an unfathomable mystery. I see nothing here of man.  Near as I may approach, closely as I may examine, all remains above comprehension--great with greatness that crushes me.  It is in vain that I reflect--all remains unaccountable! I defy you to cite another life like that of Christ.&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Restitution.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Humanity seems bent on extreme views; like a pendulum, they are on one extreme or the other till they stop. Men rush to one or the other extreme according to their temperament, till they stop making a way or plan of their own, and accept of God's way--God's plan --then they reach the center of truth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So on this subject of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Son of God;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one class will affirm that he was an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imperfect man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> born under the curse like all other men, while another class will go to the other extreme, and claim that he was JEHOVAH himself.  Both pass the center of truth while reaching the opposite extremes of error.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">On the contrary, how guarded are the Scriptures on both these points-- guarding us against both extremes and setting forth the truth, both beautiful and harmonious.  On the one hand it assures us that there is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> supreme being--Jehovah: &quot;Hear, O Israel, Jehovah our God is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jehovah&quot; (`Deut. 6:4` --Young).  To this testimony Jesus and the apostles give assent.  Jesus declares, &quot;I came...not to do </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">own</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will, but the will of him that sent me&quot;--&quot;My Father is greater than I&quot;-- at the same time assuring us that he and the Father were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in harmony and interest.  The Apostle declares the same thing, saying, &quot;There is but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.&quot; (`1 Cor. 8:6`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And, again, the head of the woman is the man, the head of every man is Christ, and &quot;the head of Christ is God&quot; --the Father (`1 Cor. 11:3` and `15:24`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other hand it assures us that he was without spot or blemish--undefiled, separate from the race of sinners --in him was no sin; he was holy</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R463 : page 1::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">from his birth; that he lost not the right to live as do we, through Adam's sin, but that &quot;in him was life,&quot; and no cause of death was found in him; and hence his death was a voluntary offering, as a payment of the penalty of our sins.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, it is the plain teaching of the Word that he who had a higher form </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">became a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> MAN--not an imperfect man, but a MAN--a full, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> representative of the highest order of earthly beings.  &quot;Thou madest him a little </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lower</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honor&quot; (`Heb. 2:7,9`). Compare, also, `Phil. 2:6-11`. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dia.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> When this perfect man consecrated himself at baptism, he was begotten to a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new nature,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> higher than human, higher than angelic, higher than the nature he had laid aside to become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Divine nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --&quot;so much </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">better</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than angels.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But this divine nature in Jesus was not attained until the consecrated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature was fully dead--only an earnest of the coming nature could the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jesus receive.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When Jesus was among men, the natural superiority of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man, the natural crown of &quot;glory and honor&quot;-- attaching to an unblemished Lord of earth--caused him to shine among men, so that his enemies said, &quot;Never man spake like this man,&quot; and the multitudes hung on his words, and, if he had not hindered, would have taken him by force and made him a king.  Even as a lad he was able to confound the most learned of his nation.  So much, at least, may be said of Jesus as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Added to these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> powers were the special gifts of miracles which were given him as attesting that he was owned of God.  Yet, it should be remembered, that it was not the miracles which specially marked him as above other men; for miracles, and even raising of the dead, had been done by Prophets centuries before.  That which impressed the above writers, and all thinking people, when studying the record of Jesus, is the grand </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his being--of his acts and his teachings.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor, should we so much wonder at this, if it were but borne in mind that the perfect man was an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earthly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> IMAGE (in qualities and powers) of the Creator.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While, then, truth--a right appreciation of our Lord Jesus--is desirable at any cost, we can see </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> reasonable excuse for that extreme error which would denominate him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jehovah,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than for that other extreme which would class him among the sin-cursed, imperfect and depraved race from which Scripture declares he was separate.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Lest some should forget previous expressions on the subject, let us state that we hold that when the sacrifice of the perfect human nature was ended, the Father highly exalted Jesus to the perfection of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature, far above angels and every other order of creation --next to the Father.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">====================</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R463 : page 1::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WE ANSWER FOR THEM.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It will be remembered, that in discussing the erroneous teachings of two contemporaries --&quot;Zion's Day Star&quot; and &quot;The World's Hope&quot;--we called attention to the fact that they used the scriptural terms </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Ransom,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Redeem,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Bought with a Price,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc., dishonestly. We proposed to test them before their readers by putting a few straight forward questions, which, in answering, we had hoped their true position would have been manifested.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Both Journals have had abundant opportunity, and neither has attempted an answer.  We, therefore, propose to answer them for them--no, not for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">them,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but for their reader's benefit.  This we could have done before, but preferred to give them first an opportunity to state themselves, lest some should think we misjudged or misunderstood them.  It must now be manifest to all, that, as we claimed, they have been practicing a deception upon their readers--putting their own </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">private interpretation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> upon the words and ideas referred to, when they quoted them.  Is not this deception? and is not a religious deception the worst species of fraud?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To bring the question before you, we quote from our February issue as follows:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;If this contemporary plainly stated itself as numbers of others do, we should have no special need to single it out among others for criticism.  But it does not.  It covertly attempts to steal the hearts of God's children and engraft this &quot;damnable heresy&quot; (`2 Pet. 2:1`) upon their minds, by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">quoting</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> freely enough of the passages which contain</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R463 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;bought with a price,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;redeemed,&quot; &quot;ransom,&quot; etc., disclaiming, without attempting to disprove their meaning, or deny their genuineness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It insinuates and argues in such a way as to rob these words of their correct import in the mind of those who possess no English Dictionary, or are too careless to use it; or who presume that the English words may have a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">different</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> significance from the Greek ones which the Apostles used, but which they do not understand.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have heretofore shown that the Greek words rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;bought,&quot; &quot;ransom,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;redeem,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc., in referring to the work of Jesus for men, are no less pointed, but, if possible, more so than their English equivalents.  So far, then, from being an exponent of the world's hope, or the church's either, our contemporary is being used by the adversary in a covert, and therefore all the more dangerous way, to undermine the only hope held out for the world in Scripture--the ransom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To put this matter fairly before its readers, (to most of whom we send a copy of this issue) we shall propose to it the same questions which in our last we propounded to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Day Star,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and which it has not answered--probably because it did not wish so plainly to show its </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">real belief.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We are well aware that neither of these contemporaries will relish these questions.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have tried to so state them that any attempt to dodge the real issue will, we hope, be so apparent as to attract the attention of any who might be inclined to think our criticisms too severe.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The questions are as follows:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) Why did Jesus die?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) How does it effect our sins?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) How did he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">put away sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the sacrifice of himself?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) In what way did he give &quot;himself a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Greek, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">antilutron</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--an equivalent price) for all?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) In what way was he a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;propitiation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (satisfaction) for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sins?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(6) In what sense were we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;bought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with a price?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, fair warning; if our contemporaries do not answer these queries fully and squarely, it can only be construed as moral cowardice, and certainly will substantiate our claim that they are dealing underhandedly with their readers, and &quot;handling the Word of God deceitfully&quot; (`2 Cor. 4:2`).  The questions at issue are not trivial--not such as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brethren</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> might honestly differ on; for they are the very </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">foundation of Christianity,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> without which the whole doctrinal structure, reared by the Apostles, falls.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, let it be remembered, that we have nothing but kindly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">personal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> feelings toward the Editors of these two papers; with both of whom we are on intimate and friendly terms.  It is error and falsity which we oppose, not men. This is true of Mr. Ingersoll also.  Personally, we esteem him a polished gentleman, while we cannot but gainsay his infidel teachings.  We take the side of inspired record as against every phase of infidelity; but we cannot but admire most, those opponents who honestly differ, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">honestly state</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> their differences, instead of using a Scriptural form of words and denying the power and meaning thereof.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To answer these queries, let us take them in order.  We state the import of the teachings of these papers which are in harmony on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this question,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whatever difference there may be between them on other </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">less vital</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> points.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) Why did Jesus die?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Their answer: Because he was an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imperfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and hence as liable to death as any other member of the Adamic race, and &quot;death passed upon all.&quot;  (See `Rom. 5:12`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We object and answer, &quot;that no cause of death was in him&quot;--&quot;in him was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not death.  In him was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no sin,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hence on him the punishment of sin-- death--could have no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  His death was a free-will sacrifice as our redemption price.  He could have sustained life as a perfect and sinless man forever, but he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;gave his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life a ransom for many.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul substantiates our position, saying: &quot;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:3`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) How does Jesus' death affect our sins?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Their answer: It has no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">direct</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> effect upon our sins.  We die for our own sins and thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pay our own penalty.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jesus died for himself and thus paid for his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imperfection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (which they do not care to openly call </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">).  The indirect effect of his death was, that he furnished us an example, or illustration of fortitude and endurance, etc., and thus his death was valuable to us only as an example of how we should suffer and die for truth and right.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We object and answer, that while it is true that Jesus' life and death were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">valuable examples,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> yet they were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">much more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than this, or else scores of Scriptures are meaningless and false. The prophets, who, because of their witness for and loyalty to truth, were sawn asunder, stoned to death, etc., and the Apostles, who were crucified and beheaded, etc., these all were valiant for truth, and full of faith, and are all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good examples,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and are so recognized in Scripture (`Phil. 3:17`).  But where is it claimed that by their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">examples</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R464 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">redeemed or ransomed or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us with their blood?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The penalty of our sin was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and we could never have been freed from that great prison-house--we could never have had a resurrection to life had not some one done more than set us an example.  The question would still be, &quot;Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?&quot; And the answer points out only the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> able to deliver from the condemnation of death.  &quot;Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our Lord</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jesus Christ.&quot;  &quot;For to this end Christ both died, rose, and revived that he might be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lord</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Master--or have authority over] the living and the dead&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:57` and `Rom. 14:9`).  We answer this question then: &quot;He bore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in his own body on the tree&quot; (`1 Pet. 2:24`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) How did Jesus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">put away sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the sacrifice of himself?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Their answer:--By his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and teaching he taught men to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">put away sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for themselves,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and thus, in a sense, it might be said that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> put the sin away.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We object, that Moses and the prophets had taught men to abstain from sin; hence, if Jesus put away sin only by precept and example, he did no more than others.  And, if it is true, that &quot;In him was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no sin,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> how could he be an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of how to put away what he did not have?  But note, the question is a quotation from Paul (`Heb. 9:26`), and it reads that he put away sin, not by precept and example of his life, but &quot;by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of himself.&quot;  Read the connections, and try to view the matter from the Apostle's inspired standpoint, and unless you think, as one of these contemporaries does, that Paul often made mistakes and misquotations, you should be convinced of his meaning when penning these words.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Remember, too, that when Moses, as a type of Jesus, taught men to abstain from sin, he, too, did more--he typically made a sin offering--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a sacrifice for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And the antitype not only taught purity, but did more--made himself </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice for sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the true sacrifice.  &quot;The Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) In what way did he give &quot;himself a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Gr. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">antilutron</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--an equivalent or corresponding price) for all?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To this question they can give no answer except by denying the meaning of the word, which any one may see by reference to Young's Concordance.  The significance of the original is very pointed. Jesus not only gave a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">price</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the ransom of the Adamic race, but Paul says he gave an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">equivalent price.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  A </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man had sinned and forfeited all right to life: Jesus, another perfect man, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bought back</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> those forfeited rights by giving his unforfeited human existence a ransom--an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">equivalent price.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Read now Paul's argument (`Rom. 5:18,19`): &quot;Therefore, as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so, by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.  For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) In what way was he &quot;a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">propitiation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (satisfaction) for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sins?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is another question which they cannot answer.  They would like to declare that he was not a satisfaction in this sense, or not a satisfaction in that sense, or not a satisfaction in some other sense; but the question, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">In what</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sense</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was he a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;satisfaction</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sins?&quot; they cannot answer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We answer, that this text is in perfect harmony with all Scripture.  The Law of life (obedience) was broken by Adam, and both he and his posterity were condemned as unfit for life.  Jesus became our ransom by paying our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death penalty,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and thus justifying us to life, which in due time comes to all, to be again either accepted or rejected.  Yes, we are glad that the claims of the Law upon our race were fully satisfied by our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Redeemer.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(6) In what sense were we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;bought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with a price?&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Their answer: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not a good word; it conveys too much of the &quot;commercial idea&quot;; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would say, rather, ye were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">taken,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We object; by such false reasonings the Word of God would be robbed of all its meaning.  Words are useless unless they carry some </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">idea.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  What other meaning is there in the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;bought&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than the &quot;commercial idea&quot;?  It has no other meaning or idea to it.  But Paul was a lawyer, and his teachings, more than any other Apostles', are hard to twist; and in this instance he guards well his statement, by saying, not only that we were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;bought,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but he says it was with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;a price;&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and then, lest some one should claim that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">price</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was the ministry and teachings of Jesus, Peter is caused to guard it by adding--&quot;With the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">precious blood</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot.&quot; (`1 Cor. 6:20`; `1 Pet. 1:19`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In conclusion, let us say in a few words, what they do think of the value and preciousness of the death of Christ. They believe and have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">privately</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> expressed, and it is the covered import of their public teachings, which they do not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">yet wish</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to state boldly--not until they get false premises and conclusions engrafted first, as a basis on which to place it,--that Jesus' death no more paid your ransom price than did Paul's or than my death would; nay, put it stronger, that his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no value</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redeeming</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As before pointed out, this denial of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we believe to be the great rock upon which the nominal Church is even to-day being dashed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The doctrine of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">substitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Jesus, in settlement of the sinner's guilt and punishment, is being scoffed at among the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;great preachers&quot;;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the doctrine, so plainly taught by the apostles, that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Jesus was the price of our release from death, is falling into discredit and disrepute among the &quot;worldly great,&quot; and hence also among some who would like to be of that class.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The reason of this is evident: it is the story of the two extremes over again.  Satan had engrafted on the Church the doctrine of eternal torment, and, to be consistent, led on to the thought that Jesus bore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eternal torment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for every man.  This involved eternity of suffering by Jesus.  This evidently was untrue; so it was explained, that when in Gethsemane and at Calvary, Jesus suffered as much agony in a few hours as all humanity would have suffered in an eternity of torture.  Now, it does not take a very smart man to see that something is surely wrong in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such a view</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Jesus' substitution.  It seems to be Satan's policy now to lead to the opposite extreme and deny substitution entirely. Instead of casting away Satan's libel on our Heavenly Father's government-- the doctrine of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eternal torment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--most men seem to hold on to it and roll it as a sweet morsel under their tongues, and discard the teachings of the Apostles relative to Jesus' </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> being our ransom price--the price or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">substitute</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for our forfeited lives.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Would that all might see the beauties and harmonies of God's Word.  Man condemned to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--extinction; Jesus, man's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">substitute</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> died </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our sins and thus redeemed or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bought us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">back</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to life, which redemption will be accomplished by a resurrection to life. Jesus, as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is dead eternally; his humanity stayed in death as our ransom, and he arose </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a new creature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--a spiritual instead of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> being--put to death in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but quickened (made alive) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in spirit.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Though we have known Christ after the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> yet now henceforth know we him (so) no more.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Beloved, let us stand firm on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">foundation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of all hope--the ransom-- and now, when the enemy comes in like a flood, be not afraid to act and speak for truth boldly if you would be recognized by him who lifts up a standard for the people (`Isa. 59:19`).</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PASSOVER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This was and yet is among Israelites one of the most important of their religious observances.  It was the first feature of &quot;the Law&quot; given them as a typical people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The ceremony, as originally instituted, is described in `Exod. 12`.  A lamb without blemish was slain, its blood was sprinkled on the doorposts and lintels of the house, while the family within ate the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.  On that night (the fourteenth of the first month, Jewish time), because of the sprinkled blood and the eaten lamb the first-born children of Israel were passed over, or spared from the plague of death which visited the first-born of the Egyptians. On this account, and because on the next day Israel marched out from Egyptian bondage--free--therefore, by God's command (`Exod. 12:14`), they commemorated it every year on its anniversary.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Israelite saw only the letter of this ceremony, and not its typical significance. So, too, might we have been in similar darkness had not the Holy Spirit of God given us the key to its meaning by inspiring the Apostle to write the words (`1 Corinthians 5:7`): &quot;CHRIST OUR PASSOVER IS SACRIFICED FOR US; THEREFORE LET US KEEP THE FEAST.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our attention being thus called to the matter by the Spirit, we find other Scriptures which clearly show that Jesus, &quot;the Lamb of God,&quot; was the antitype of the Passover lamb, and that his death was as essential to the deliverance of &quot;the Church of the first-borns&quot; from death, as was the death of the typical lamb to the first-borns of Israel.  Thus, led of the Spirit, we come to the words and acts of Jesus at the last Passover which he ate with his disciples.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God is very exact, and the slaying of the typical lamb, on the fourteenth day of the first month, foreshadowed or typified the fact that in God's plan Jesus was to die at that time.  And, it is remarkable, that God so arranged the reckoning of time among the Jews that it was possible for Jesus to commemorate the Passover with the disciples, and himself be slain as the real &quot;Lamb&quot; on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same day.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  [The Jewish day, instead of reckoning from midnight to midnight as usually reckoned now, commenced at six o'clock in the evening and ended at six the next evening.]  Thus Jesus and the disciples, by eating the Passover, probably about eight o'clock, ate it &quot;the same night in which he was betrayed,&quot; and the same day in which he died-- thus every jot and tittle should be and was fulfilled.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Just </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">five</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> days before his crucifixion Jesus presented himself before them, to be received or rejected--when he rode to the city on the ass, fulfilling the prophecy, &quot;Behold, thy king cometh unto thee&quot; (`Matt. 21:5`), and fulfilling, at the same time, that feature of the Passover type which provides that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lamb</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must be received into the houses </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">five</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> days before the time of its killing (`Exod. 12:2`).  Thus Jesus made his last presentation to Israel as a nation, or house, five days before the Passover, as we read: &quot;Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany.... On the next day [five days before] much people that were come to the feast, when they heard Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,...went forth to meet him (`John 12:1,12,13`).  Then it was that their king came unto them--sitting upon an ass's colt.&quot;  Then it was that he wept over them and declared, &quot;Your house is left unto you desolate.&quot;  &quot;Ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord&quot; (`Matt. 23:38,39`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus knew the import of the Passover, but the disciples knew not.  He was alone; none could sympathize, none could encourage him.  Even had he explained to the disciples, they could not have understood, or appreciated his explanation, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">because</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they were not yet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of the Spirit.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Nor could they be thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until justified from Adamic sin--passed over, or reckoned free from sin by virtue of the slain Lamb, whose shed blood ransomed them from the power of the destroyer--death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus alone--treading the narrow way which none before had trod, and in which he is our Fore-runner and Leader --what wonder that His heart at times was exceeding sorrowful even unto death. When the time had come they sat down to eat the Passover, and Jesus said unto the disciples: &quot;With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.  I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof until it be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fulfilled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the kingdom of God&quot; (`Luke 22:15,16`). Doubtless he longed to have them understand how it would BEGIN </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to be</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fulfilled,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a little later on in that very day, by the slaying of the real Lamb.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Probably one reason he specially desired to eat this Passover with them was, that he there designed breaking the truth of its significance to them to the extent they could receive it; for, &quot;As they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take (eat), this is my body&quot; (`Mark 14:22`).  &quot;This is my body, which is given for you: THIS DO </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">remembrance of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ME.&quot;  &quot;And he took the cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R466 : page 3::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">...This cup is the new covenant, in my blood, which is shed for you&quot; (`Luke 22:17-20`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We cannot doubt that the design of the Master was to call their minds from the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">typical lamb</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to himself, the antitype, and to show them that it would be no longer proper to observe a feature of the Law which he was about to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fulfill.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> And the bread and wine were to be to them thereafter the elements which, as remembrancers of him, would take the place of the lamb.  Thus considered, there is force in his words, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;This do in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">remembrance of ME&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--no longer kill a literal lamb in remembrance of a typical deliverance; but, instead, use the bread and wine, representatives of my flesh and life--the basis of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">real deliverance</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --the real passing over.  &quot;Hence, let as many as receive me and my words henceforth do THIS in remembrance of me.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus our Lord instituted his Supper as the remembrancer of his death, and as a substitute for the Passover as observed by the Jews.  Is it asked why Jesus ate of the typical lamb first?  We answer that he was born under the dominion of the Law, and must observe its every requirement.  Since he made an end of the Law, nailing it to his cross, we are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">free</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from Law, as relates to either the Passover or the Lord's Supper--its substitute--but we are of those who esteem it a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">privilege</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to celebrate each year the anniversary of our Lord's death; to DO THIS </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in remembrance</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of him--&quot;for even Christ </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Passover</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is slain, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> LET US keep the feast.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It would be difficult to determine just when or why this impressive season for the commemoration of our Lord's death was ignored, but it was, doubtless, as an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;expediency.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Doubtless zealous teachers thought that the great Teacher had made a mistake, and that it was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;expedient&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to have it oftener than once a year; and all seem to have understood Paul to teach that it made no difference how often it was observed when he said: &quot;As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come&quot; (`1 Cor. 11:26`).  But a careful study of all Paul said on the subject should convince all that this was not the case.  In the context he tells them (`verse 23`) that he delivered to them that which he also received </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of the Lord:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;That the Lord Jesus, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the same night</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in which he was betrayed, took bread,&quot; etc.  Here notice not only that the time selected by Jesus seemed the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">most appropriate,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but that it was so appropriate that Paul was informed, by a special revelation from the Lord, that this was instituted </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the night he was betrayed.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">often</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could the Church break </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that bread</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and drink </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that cup</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a proper memorial of the Lord's death? Surely only on its anniversary.  In the same way, when American independence is celebrated, it is on its anniversary --the Fourth of July.  It would be considered peculiar, at least, if some should neglect July fourth and celebrate it at sundry inappropriate times.  And if speaking of the fourth of July, we should say, as often as ye thus celebrate ye do show forth the nation's birth, who would understand us to mean several times a year?  Likewise, also, the Lord's Supper is only properly a celebration on its anniversary.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some think that they find records in Scripture which indicate that the early Church ate the Lord's Supper every First-day.  To this we answer, that if this were true we should have no more to say on the subject; but where is the record?  We are referred to `Acts 20:7`: &quot;Upon the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the week, when the disciples came together to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">break</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bread,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Paul preached unto them,&quot; etc. But is there any </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">evidence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the bread was broken as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">remembrancer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lord's death?  If so, why was it never </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">called</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Lord's Supper, and why was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> omitted?  Was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cup</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not as important an emblem as the bread? Because it is written that Jesus was known to the two disciples at Emmaus (`Luke 24:30`) in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;breaking of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bread,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who will claim that that was more than an ordinary meal?  Who will claim that they were eating the Lord's Supper?  No one.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So far from being an appropriate time for the commemoration of our Lord's death, the first day of the week, or Lord's day, would be most inappropriate. Instead of being set apart or used by the early Church to commemorate Jesus' death and the sorrowful scenes of the Lord's Supper, Gethsemane and Calvary, it was to them a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">glad</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> day--a day of rejoicing and hosanna's, saying, &quot;THE LORD IS RISEN INDEED.&quot; Hence its name and general observance by the Church as a day of worship and praise.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The seeming custom of breaking bread every Lord's day, perhaps had its rise in the fact that disciples were few and came sometimes long distances to meet together on the Lord's day, and socially ate a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">meal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> together.  Perhaps, too, a blessed association of thought and interest lingered round the breaking of bread on the first day, when they remembered how repeatedly Jesus manifested himself to them on that day-- after his resurrection--and how it was while they were eating that he made himself known (`Luke 24:35`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Even the faint traces of this once established custom in the Church--of celebrating the anniversary of the Lord's death and resurrection--which the Roman and Episcopal Churches still observe, after an accommodated fashion, on &quot;Good Friday,&quot; has been almost lost sight of by the other sects.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been the custom of many of the WATCH TOWER readers to DO THIS in remembrance of our Lord's death on its anniversary.  Believing that it properly takes the place of the type-- the Passover--we reckon it according to Jewish, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lunar</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time, and hence frequently on a different date from &quot;Good Friday,&quot; which is reckoned on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">solar</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time.  The Passover this year comes on Lord's day, April 22d, at six P.M.; hence the time answering to the hour of Jesus' death would be three o'clock, P.M., of that day, and the time for the eating of the Lord's Supper would be about seven to eight o'clock of the Saturday evening preceding April 21st. It should be remembered that the Lamb was slain the day before the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Feast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Passover commenced.  It will be celebrated as usual.  We should, as heretofore, seek to follow the example of the first Communion service--using unleavened bread* and wine--whilst we talk together of their significance and value.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE IMPORT OF THE EMBLEMS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It might be profitable to some to point out the significance of the broken loaf and the cup.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of the bread, Jesus said: &quot;It is my flesh&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it represents his flesh-- his humanity which was broken or sacrificed for us.  Unless he had sacrificed himself--his humanity for us--we could never have had a resurrection from death--could never have had a future life; as he said, &quot;Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man...ye have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in you&quot; (`John 6:53`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Not only was the breaking of Jesus' body thus the providing of a bread of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of which if a man eat he shall never die, but it was also the opening of the narrow </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">way</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to life and the breaking, or unsealing, of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a means of aid to walk the narrow way which leads to life.  And thus we see that it was the breaking of him who said, &quot;I am the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">way,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the TRUTH and the LIFE; no man cometh unto the Father but by ME&quot; (`John 14:6`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Hence, when we eat of the broken loaf, we should realize that had he not died--been broken </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--we should never have been able to come to the Father, but would have remained </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forever</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> under the curse of Adamic sin and death, and should never have been made acquainted with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">way,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or the Father.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another thought: the bread was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">un-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">leavened --without leaven.  [Leaven is corruption, an element of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">decay</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or decomposition.] Leaven is a type of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the decomposition, decay and death which sin works in mankind; so, then, this type declares that Jesus was free from sin--a lamb without spot or blemish--&quot;holy, harmless, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">undefiled.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Had Jesus been of Adamic stock, had he received the life principle in the usual way from an earthly father, he, too, would have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">leavened,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as are all other men, by Adamic sin; but his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> came direct from God--hence he is called the bread from heaven.  (See `John 6:41`).  Let us, then, appreciate the bread as pure, unleavened, and so let us eat of him; eating and digesting truth, and especially this truth; appropriating by faith his righteousness to ourselves by which we realize him as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">way</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle, by divine revelation, communicates to us a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">further</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> meaning of the bread, and shows that not only did the loaf represent Jesus, individually, as our head, etc., but that, after we have partaken thus of him, we may, by consecration, be associated with him as parts of one loaf (one body) to be broken for, and become food for, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Cor. 10:16`).  This same thought of our privilege as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> believers, sharing now in the sufferings and death of Christ, and thus becoming joint-heirs with him of future glories, and associates in the work of blessing and giving life to all the families of the earth, is expressed by the Apostle repeatedly and under various figures; but when he compares the Church to the loaf now being broken as a whole, as Jesus was individually, it furnishes a striking and forcible illustration of our union and fellowship with our Head.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He says, &quot;Because there is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one loaf</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we, the many [persons] are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf.&quot;  &quot;The loaf which we break, is it not a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">participation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the body of the Anointed one?&quot; (`1 Cor. 10:16,17`--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Diaglott).</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The wine represents the life given-- the sacrifice--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;This is my blood (symbol of LIFE </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">given up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in death) of the new covenant, shed for</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is by the giving up of his life as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the life of the Adamic race,</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">which sin had forfeited, that a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">right to</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> LIFE comes to men. (See `Rom. 5:18,19`). Jesus' shed blood was the &quot;ransom for all,&quot; but his act of handing the cup to the disciples, and asking them to drink of it, was an invitation to them to become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partakers of his sufferings,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or, as Paul expresses it, to &quot;fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ.&quot;  (`Col. 1:24`.) &quot;The cup of blessing, for which we bless God, is it not a participation of the blood [shed blood--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Anointed one?&quot; (`1 Cor. 10:16`--Diaglott). Would that all could realize the value of the cup, and could bless God for an opportunity of suffering with Christ that we may be also glorified together.&quot; (`Rom. 8:17`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus attaches this significance to the cup elsewhere, indicating that it is the cup of sacrifice, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of our humanity. For instance, when asked by two disciples a promise of future glory in his throne, He answered them: &quot;Ye know not what ye ask; are ye able to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">drink of the cup</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that I shall drink of?&quot; Wine is also a symbol of joy and invigoration: so we will share Jesus' glories, honors and immortality--when we drink it new with him in the kingdom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us then, dearly beloved, as we surround the table to commemorate our Lord's death, call to mind the meaning of what we do, and see to it that we feed on Him; and, when strengthened by the living bread, let us drink with him into his death.  &quot;For if we be dead with him we shall live with him; if we suffer we shall also reign with him.&quot; (`2 Tim. 2:11,12`).</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHO MAY COMMUNE?</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Every member of Christ--even one alone with the Master may commemorate --but, so far as possible, all members of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one loaf</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should meet together. Ceremonious formality would be out of place--but, &quot;Let all things be done decently and in order.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another thought: while it is proper that we should thus commemorate &quot;Our Passover,&quot; or its anniversary, yet it should not be forgotten, that in a sense we eat and drink, and have this sacred fellowship with our Lord every day and every hour.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">night</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in which Israel ate of their Passover lamb, with &quot;bitter herbs,&quot; typified the entire Gospel Age; and their deliverance from Egypt followed in the morning.  So with us, we eat of our Lamb with the bitter trials and afflictions of evil in the present age--but joy cometh in the morning--our deliverance from earth and the dominion and oppression of evil. The morning already is dawning, let us </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hasten the more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to &quot;fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle Paul seems to enforce the ideas we have just presented relative to the meaning of this ordinance, and shows the necessity of a proper appreciation of its meaning.  He warns (`1 Cor. 11:27-30`--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Diaglott),</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that &quot;whoever may eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily will be an offender against the body and blood of the Lord.  But let a man examine himself, and thus [with an understanding and appreciation of its significance] let him eat of the bread and let him drink of the cup; for he eats and drinks judgment [condemnation] to himself who eats and drinks not discriminating [appreciating] the Lord's body. Through this [lack of a proper appreciation of the true import--that it signifies </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our sharing in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the sufferings and death of Christ--for this reason] many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The truth of Paul's remarks we can each bear witness to.  Many in the Church, not only of the nominal Church, but many members of the true Church, &quot;whose names are written in heaven,&quot; are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">weak</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sickly,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and many have gone asleep entirely, become dead to spiritual things, and, as dead branches, are cut off from the vine--the overcoming Church (`John 15:2`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If, then, we would become strong and full of spiritual vigor, and &quot;not sleep as do others,&quot; when we annually ratify our covenant, let us examine ourselves, and thus let us partake of the sufferings and the emblems, that in due time we may partake of His glory also.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHAT THINK YE OF CHRIST?--WHOSE</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SON IS HE?</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The editor of a contemporary answers the above question in a very unsatisfactory manner.  Rejecting, with undisguised contempt, the doctrine of the &quot;immaculate conception,&quot; and laboring to prove unworthy of credence the simple story of the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy relative to it, found in Matthew and Luke, boldly assumes the position that Christ is the natural son of Joseph. But will he accept the legitimate consequences of this position?  We shall see.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That Christ is the son of David the Jews, blind as they were, understood perfectly; but, having no faith in his immaculate conception, they were utterly unable to answer the final question: &quot;If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?&quot;  Can our contemporary do better than they from the same stand-point?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But Israel's Messiah, the Christ of the Bible, is not only the son of David, but he is the divinely-appointed heir to David's throne.  The purpose for which I write is to show from the Scriptures that if Jesus of Nazareth is the natural son of Joseph, he can never sit on David's throne, and, consequently, is not the true Messiah.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If we can believe the Record (and, if not, we know nothing about the matter), Joseph must trace his descent from David, back through that long line of kings beginning with Solomon.  This question, then, demands an authoritative answer.  Can the real heir to David's throne come in that line?  The careful Bible student will learn two things:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">1. If Solomon had obeyed God as did David his father, the throne of David would have been established in his line forever; consequently, the deathless heir to that throne would have come of his seed just as certainly as of David's. Proof: &quot;The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, he will not turn from it, of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">If thy children will keep</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their children shall also sit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">upon thy throne forevermore&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Psa. 132:11,12`). But in what line?  &quot;And of all my sons (for God hath given me many sons), he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel....Moreover [beyond all this], </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will establish his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">kingdom forever if he will be constant to</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">do my statutes and my judgments as at</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this day&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Chron. 28:5-7`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Had they been thus obedient, the throne of David would not have been overturned, nor his crown profaned &quot;by casting it down to the ground,&quot; but there would have been an unbroken line of kings from David to Christ.  Proof: &quot;If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not fail thee [be cut off from thee, from</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the throne</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--margin] (said he) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a man on</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the throne of Israel&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Kings 2:4`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a principle, the correctness of which few will question, that whatever is clearly promised on condition of obedience is forfeited if that obedience is not rendered.  On this ground alone we must conclude that David's throne and kingdom cannot be established forever in Solomon's line.  If we are right in this conclusion, the Scriptures will sustain the position.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;To the law,&quot; then,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;and to the testimony&quot;:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;And thou Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart....If thou seek him he will be found of thee, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">but if thou forsake him he</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will cast thee off forever.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Chron. 28:9`). Again, &quot;And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel....Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee...</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will surely</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rend the kingdom from thee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">....Notwithstanding, in thy days I will not do it--for David thy father's sake; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.  Howbeit, I will not rend away all the kingdom, but will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, which I have chosen&quot; (`1 Kings 11:9-13`).  Thus, ten out of twelve parts of &quot;the kingdom of the Lord over Israel&quot; was rent away from Solomon's line immediately after his death, and the remaining portion was retained, not for his sake, but for David's and Jerusalem's sake.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us now listen while God declares his purpose concerning the two last kings in Solomon's line: &quot;Thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">He shall have none to sit upon the throne</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of David&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Jer. 36:30`).  Of Jeshoniah, or Coniah as he is sometimes called, we read: &quot;As I live, saith the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence.... Is this man Coniah a despised, broken idol?  Is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure?  Wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?  O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no man of his seed shall prosper,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sitting on the throne of David, and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ruling any more in Judah&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Jer. 22:24-30`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R468 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Two things seem very certain: 1. If Christ is the son of Joseph, he came in Solomon's line; and if the kingdom is restored to that line, it was just as really rent away from David, who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obeyed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God, as from Solomon, who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">disobeyed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him-- all his promises and threatenings to the contrary notwithstanding.  2. If he is Joseph's son he not only came in Solomon's line, but he is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;this man's&quot; seed;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and yet the whole earth is called to hear the solemn declaration, &quot;NO MAN OF HIS SEED SHALL PROSPER, SITTING ON THE THRONE OF DAVID, AND RULING ANY MORE IN JUDAH&quot; (`Jer. 22:30`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I think I have fully sustained the position taken at first, that if Jesus of Nazareth is the natural son of Joseph, he can never sit on the throne of his father David, and, consequently, is not the true Messiah.  But he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the son of Joseph; and I am not disposed to leave this subject until I have shown, not only that he did not come in that line, but that it was predicted that he should not so come.  But, first, let me quote a prophecy which is very suggestive, coming as it does immediately after the last one named above: &quot;Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">righteous Branch,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">King shall reign and prosper.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">...In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby he shall be called (by), JEHOVAH--OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot; [See Young's translation.] (`Jer. 23:6`.) Compare these two prophecies and draw your own conclusions.  But I wish to make a point here.  The editor, before referred to, thinks Matthew's application of Isaiah's prophecy is extremely absurd. &quot;And the fact that Isaiah names the child Immanuel, while the angel names Mary's child Jesus, is proof that the two are entirely different, and bear no relation to each other whatever.&quot;  Will he also claim that this Branch, raised up unto David, bears no relation to Mary's child, because the latter was named at his birth Jesus, and not &quot;OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS&quot;?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Even the long-suffering of God has a limit, and Solomon's line of kings reached it at last.  This is the record of it: &quot;And thou profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end.  Thus saith the Lord, Remove the diadem and take off the crown: this shall not be the same [how shall it be then?]; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exalt</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him that is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">low</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">abase</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him that is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">high.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Every one must admit that Solomon's royal line is the high branch of the Davidic house.  This, then, must be abased, and a low branch exalted, when, after the predicted overturning, the throne, the kingdom and the crown shall be given to him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;whose right it is.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Mary seemed to catch the inspiration of this truth when she exclaimed: &quot;He hath regarded the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">low estate</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his handmaiden; for, from henceforth, all generations shall call me blessed.  He hath </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">put down the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mighty from their seats</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exalted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">low degree.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If you will turn to `Luke 3:23` and onward, you will find that, while Joseph came of the royal line, as Matthew testifies, Mary came of that obscure one beginning with Nathan.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In conclusion, let me say, that whatever others may do in regard to this question, it is my purpose to &quot;Let God be true,&quot; if it makes all men liars.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SPEAK TO INDIVIDUALS SINGLY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It will be well for us to learn to speak to individuals singly.  &quot;A congregation of one&quot; may be large enough to call forth all our powers in proclaiming the great news of salvation.  Often we may save sinners one by one.  If you had a bushel of bottles, and wanted to fill them with water, you would not think the quickest way would be to get a fire engine and hose and play over the heap, especially if the corks were all in, but you would be likely to take a single bottle by the neck, extract the cork, and then, by means of a funnel, turn in a little water at a time until it was filled; and then take another and repeat the process.  You would get more bottles filled that way than with a hose and fire engine playing upon them.  So you may be able to accomplish more by working single-handed than in crowds.  You may preach the word by the wayside or by the fireside, for people need the same Gospel indoors as out.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We need to have the peace of God in our own hearts before we can do much good to other people's hearts; and unless we can rule our own spirits we shall not accomplish much in molding the spirits of others.  We notice a blacksmith uses a cold hammer to bend a hot iron; and after working with his tools a little while he plunges them into cold water.  So, if you are to influence others, you must keep cool yourself; if you get your hammer hot you will not be able to bend the iron. It is useless to undertake to fight the devil with fire....You know the story of the old French general, who, when he had besought the king to spare the Christians from persecution, and had been refused, said: &quot;Sire, God's Church is an anvil that has worn out a great many hammers.&quot;  Now, if you are filled with the Holy Spirit, you can stand a great deal of hammering, and the world will mock and sneer at you in vain.  If you keep near the Lord you will ever triumph in His grace.          H. L. HASTINGS.</font><br />

<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;They loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The want of moral honesty is the principal impediment to the progress of religious truth now, as in the days of the Nazarene.  Many who heard him speak and beheld his prodigies, were convinced of the truth of his claims as a teacher &quot;sent from God&quot;; but his doctrines so conflicted with the popular customs they could not be accepted, only at the cost of social position.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">integrity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his hearers was put to the test; and the honest among them made the requisite sacrifice, and publicly accepted his teaching; but those who loved the praise of men more than the approbation of God, suppressed their convictions, and hypocritically adhered to the popular multitude.  It is just so now in regard to all attempts to reform the absurd and conflicting creedal systems of our age.  A large majority of modern preachers, and of the intelligent lay members of the churches, are as fully convinced of the fallacy of modern theology, and the impotency of modern pulpits in reforming the world, as the writer; but their love of popularity and ease, and lack of trust in God, cause them to remain through life in a false and hypocritical position--their life a continuous </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lie.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ said to his disciples, &quot;Ye are the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">salt</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the earth; but if the salt has lost its savor, it is fit for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot.&quot; Here we have the estimate Jesus placed upon those Christians who suppress their convictions for the sake of popularity. He compares them to a man who lights a candle and puts it under a cover to conceal its light.  He says, &quot;Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you; so did their fathers to the false prophets.&quot;  &quot;Ye are they who justify</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R468 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God&quot; (`Luke 16:15`).  But to those who are ostracised for defending the truth he says, &quot;Blessed are ye when men shall hate and revile you, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">separate you from their company,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and cast out your name as evil for the Son of Man's sake.  Rejoice, for great is your reward in heaven.&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In `Luke 11:1,2` we are told that as Jesus &quot;was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.  And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father who art in heaven.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Before we ever saw the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">plan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God in the orders of salvation (`1 Cor. 15:23`), we often found ourselves confused in our manner of addressing the Diety; and, since we saw the plan, it was a long time before we were able to get the subject clear in our mind as to the proper </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of address.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have noticed that others, apparently, have the same difficulty, for we have heard them address the Father and the Son, indiscriminately, in the same prayer.  While we recognize the fact that &quot;God hath </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">made</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> this same Jesus...both LORD and Christ&quot; (`Acts 2:36`), we see the importance of discriminating between the FATHER and the SON, and of addressing a throne of grace, not only in the spirit, but with the understanding also.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some may think it unimportant, but, if this were so, Jesus would evidently have told the disciples so when they made the request quoted above; but,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R469 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">instead of making such a statement, he answered the question in the manner referred to.  We have earnestly desired that God would be pleased to teach us how to address him, for we did not wish to dishonor the Father nor the Son, nor to grieve the Holy Spirit in our addresses at the throne.  We hardly think we should have arrived at the conclusion which we have, had it not been for the understanding of the plan.  Jesus says, &quot;No man cometh unto the Father but by me&quot; (`John 14:6`).  There is a significance in the words, so often sung, which perhaps are not as often understood: &quot;Come to Jesus.&quot;  &quot;Come, ye sinners, poor and needy.&quot;  God (the Father) heareth not sinners (`John 9:31`), but Jesus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">does.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He says, &quot;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden [with sin], and I will give you rest&quot; (`Matt. 11:28`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then, before justification, while getting a sight of our sin and corruption, we cry unto Jesus--he is our way unto God.  The faith of the repentant soul hears him say, &quot;Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.&quot;  After being justified, but before sanctification (consecration of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature), we are reckoned sons of God on the earthly plane, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">candidates</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for heirship with Christ.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we are reckoned perfect human beings, like Adam before he sinned, and like Jesus before baptism.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand that Jesus was a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human being from his birth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> having a body </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;prepared&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for him (`Heb. 10:5`); while </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the moment of forgiveness, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are reckoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so in honor of our faith in the sacrifice which he made, which sacrifice was for the purpose of redeeming the lost race; of placing in the prison house a &quot;representative&quot;--a &quot;substitute&quot;--that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">represented</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> might go free, the forfeit being paid, the penalty met in the person of Christ, and the demands of God's holy law vindicated.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Because we have repented of our sins and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who &quot;taketh away the sin of the world&quot; (`John 1:29`), on him who is &quot;the propitiation for our sins&quot; (`1 John 2:2`), and, as our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">desire</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we are so reckoned on his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">account, i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;for Jesus' sake;&quot; and the beseeching invitation comes to us who are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;brethren&quot; (of Jesus, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">before</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his consecration to death) to present our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;bodies</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (plural) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God&quot; (`Rom. 12:1`).  We are told that if we do this, and &quot;suffer </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we shall also reign with him,&quot; we shall be made possessors of immortality, shall be made like unto Christ's glorious body, be made partakers of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine nature.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">when</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we make this covenant of death with Jesus, we are reckoned as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partaking</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the divine nature--&quot;begotten again&quot; (not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritually, i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> twice spiritually, as some have said that we say).  We had been begotten of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh, now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we are begotten </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">again,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spirit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> adopted into the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine family,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> legally becoming divine sons, having an &quot;elder brother.&quot;  He was the &quot;first begotten,&quot; and of course at </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> begotten (God gave his only begotten Son to die for us); but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has multiplied, many have believed into him, and with him sacrificed the human, &quot;for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren (`Heb. 2:11`), but would hardly have called them brethren </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">before,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or for any other reason.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We now belong to the royal household, and are permitted to approach God by the ordinary name, &quot;Our Father,&quot; &quot;Abba Father,&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Father, Father, having been legally justified in the flesh, and, after consecrating it, &quot;received up into glory.&quot;  Coming by this &quot;new and living way&quot; into the holy place, opened up for us by Jesus, we approach with humble boldness &quot;unto a throne of grace&quot; (`Heb. 4:16`; `10:20`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">From these considerations we conclude that the man of the world, when first getting a view of his lost condition, should &quot;come to Jesus.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">After his justification he comes to the Father in Jesus' name.  A reckoned son on the plane of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restored</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Adam, he antedates &quot;the restoration&quot; of the race to the Adamic condition.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If he accepts of the invitation to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">higher</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life, and consecrates himself to death with Christ, he is still a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> son (though begotten of the Spirit) on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> plane.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While a reckoned son on either plane, we understand that it is proper to address the Father in Jesus' name; &quot;and in that day (when he sees us again [`John 16:22`] and we see him and are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ye</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall ask </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">me</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nothing.&quot; &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whatsoever</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ye shall ask the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Father</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in my name, he will give it you&quot; (`Jno. 16:23`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the betrothed asks in the name of him to whom she is betrothed; &quot;in that day&quot; she will ask in the same name, but, lo! it will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">her</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> name.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Precious name, O how sweet!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Hope of earth and joy of heaven.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps some one is ready to ask, &quot;But is that promise (`John 16:23`) to be fulfilled before the resurrection&quot;?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We think not in its </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fullness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but is so far as we &quot;ask anything </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">according</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to his will&quot; (`1 John 5:14`); but, it is evidently impossible, &quot;seeing through a glass darkly&quot; (`1 Cor. 13:12`); to always &quot;ask according to his will;&quot; but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> being &quot;like him,&quot; there will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mistake.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Whatsoever</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ye shall ask&quot; will be granted.  &quot;Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ask,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full&quot; (`John 16:24`).  It is evident that our imperfect prayers </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have to be revised by our Advocate (`1 John 2:1`), and the revised prayer might not always contain all the things asked for, but would contain all that is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but this need not be any cause for discouragement, but rather for encouragement. God help us to pray more, praying &quot;with the Spirit and with the understanding also.&quot; (`1 Cor. 14:15`.)</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PALESTINE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The houses of the common people of Greece and Rome were full of statues of deities; there was not one in a Jewish house in Palestine.  That there is a God, that he is one God, that he is a righteous God, and that he rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked, these beliefs were more than a part of the Jewish creed; they were the part of the very fiber of the Jewish character. It is from the land thus educated, through the long discipline of centuries, that have gone forth the influences which have made all other lands theistic, which have successfully banished the idols from the churches and the homes, the licentious gods and goddesses from the imagination, and godless philosophy from the intellect.  The Grecian has given the world art, the Roman law, the Anglo-Saxon commerce, the Jew religion. Greece is sacred to the artist, Rome to the statesman, England to the worker, Palestine to man.  Its hills and valleys, its lakes and rivers and sea-coast, are indissolubly connected with the history which has exercised a more powerful influence on the destinies of the race than any other province of equal size. --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lyman Abbott.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">====================</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R469 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A HARMONIOUS VIEW.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Among Christian people there are three leading views relative to Christ's coming.  We briefly state them:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">First, those called Second Adventists, look for Christ's coming, expecting that soon he will appear--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a fleshly being</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- in the sky, when instantly the Church will be caught up into the air above the earth and there remain with him, while fire and brimstone are rained upon the earth, burning it to a cinder.  During the time it is burning, and until it cools off (probably thousands of years), Christ and the Church will be waiting in the clouds.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These will then take possession of the earth, which will become as the garden of Eden again.  There they expect to &quot;build houses and inhabit them, plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them, and long enjoy the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">work of their hands.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> There they expect to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reign</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Christ as kings and priests--over whom none can tell (unless it be over one another), since all the rest of mankind must have long since perished in the burning earth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, those terming themselves Pre-Millenarians, expect Christ to come unawares and gather the Church, and with them leave the world and go to heaven for a few years.  During the absence of Christ and the Church, the world will be full of trouble, distress of nations, pouring out of the vials of wrath (more or less </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">literal),</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc.  This trouble and distress will destroy or subdue unruly sinners, and then Christ Jesus and his church will return to earth and inhabit a new Jerusalem City which will (literally) descend from the sky.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ and his saints--all glorious </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fleshly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> beings--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[called</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> SPIRITUAL as a compliment to Paul (`1 Cor. 15:44-50`), though held to be really </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fleshly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">] will then reign over the few of the nations</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R470 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">which have survived the trouble.  This reign will last a thousand years.  Then the dead, so unfortunate as not to live during the Millennial age, will be brought out of a &quot;lake of fire&quot; to earth, and arraigned for mock trial and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">condemnation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before Christ Jesus and his Church.  All will speedily be condemned and sent back to hell for never ending ages; then Christ and the Church will go to heaven and deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, and the world will be set on fire and melted--possibly to become, at some future time, again a stage for combat between new races of men and devils; or possibly to continue to roll through space a blackened cinder, a lasting memorial of the lost cause of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man's dominion,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and of God's lack of wisdom in undertaking to establish an earthly government of which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should be king. (`Psa. 8:6`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, Post-Millenarians, by far the largest class, including nearly all so-called orthodox Christians, claim that the foregoing views are too gross and materialistic.  They claim, and with good reason we think, that it would be very absurd to think of the glorious Christ and his Church (spiritual beings) either building houses and planting vineyards and enjoying the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">work of their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hands,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or reigning and living in a city in Palestine.  They think this would be progress backward and not forward. During this age, say they, the church walks by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not by sight.  To bring in a new age, in which it would walk by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sight,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would prove it to be a dispensation on a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lower</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> plane and not progression.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">They claim that the Millennium, or 1000 years' reign of truth and righteousness, will be marked by no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">visible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> manifestation of Christ to men's natural eyes, but that the Church, in her present condition, will stem the tide of evil and cause righteousness to prevail, and that thus God's kingdom--church--(which they claim is now reigning) will conquer the world, and bring about the foretold blessedness and happiness to fill the earth.  All this is to be accomplished without Jesus' personal presence here, though they claim that the Church will have special spiritual help and power from him in the great work.  When the point is reached where </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> evil and wrong is subjected to right, the plan ends </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if so aimless a supposition can be called a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">plan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at all), and then Jesus comes and the mock trial and condemnation of the ignorant and unfortunate billions, who lived before the Millennial light had fully blazed forth, are re-consigned to endless woe and the earth destroyed by fire, much as Pre-Millennialists believe.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We cannot find words to express our thankfulness to our Father that we have been led into a much more harmonious and reasonable understanding of his plan than any of these views present. These are the human reasonings on the Word of God before the true light was due.  Many still tenaciously hold these ideas of the past, but those who walk in the path, which shines more and more, are led into a more reasonable and harmonious view.  We rejoice to be of those free from fetters of human creeds --free to search and believe God's Word --free to be taught of God.  Hence, as the Millennial morn is breaking, we are prepared to see light in God's light.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The truth seems to lie </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">between</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the last two views being the extremes--Second Adventism being, in our judgment, the grossest and farthest from truth, except on the one point of man's condition in death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let us state briefly a fourth view of this subject, as seen from ZION'S WATCH TOWER, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">scriptural proofs</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of which have frequently been presented in our columns and hence are now omitted.  We ask a careful comparison of it, not only with the three above, but with God's Word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as a whole.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE FOURTH VIEW.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This view recognizes plan, system, purpose in all God's works, reading them in his statements and in his doings.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jehovah formed the earth--not to burn it, but &quot;to be inhabited.&quot;  &quot;He created it not in vain; he formed it to be inhabited&quot; (`Isa. 45:18`).  He created various orders of creatures adapted to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earthly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> home, of which man was the Chief--Lord--Ruler--King (`1 Cor. 15:40`; `Psa. 8:6`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is Jehovah's plan, and must ultimately be accomplished, but its accomplishment requires the work of seven thousand years.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Man, to be in any degree a likeness of God, must have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a free will,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and, in order to the proper use of his will, he must have knowledge.  This, God could have given him without, but permitted him to gain </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by, experience.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  When he sinned by the exercise of his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">free will,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God inflicted a righteous punishment and withdrew the life, and thus death reigned by sin, and man for 6000 years has been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">experiencing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the exceeding sinfulness of sin&quot; and the bitterness of its fruit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">During all this time Jehovah's plan did not change.  Man knew not of it, nor angels, for &quot;angels desired to look into these things,&quot; but were not permitted (`1 Pet. 1:12`).  Meanwhile God gave laws, and caused types and shadows of his plan to be enacted in a nation which he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">chose for this purpose</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Israel).  These shadows showed the leprous character of sin and pointed to the slain Lamb of God--as the means and agency for its removal--and in the type, too, was presented the blessings to follow its removal.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In due time Christ Jesus came and &quot;gave himself a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (equivalent price) for all.&quot;  Did he come too soon, since sin must reign the full 6000 years? No, our Father had another part of his</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R470 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">plan hidden in this plan for earth!  It was to select </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;a peculiar people,&quot; &quot;a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">little flock,&quot; &quot;the Bride,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who should be lifted out of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> entirely and become new creatures--partakers of the Bridegroom's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Divine nature.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Thus the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world, was not too soon, but in &quot;due time.&quot;  All must be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before any could be selected, and there was just sufficient time for the selection of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bride</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before the due time should come for giving the human family a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (experience) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and bringing in everlasting righteousness, and restoring to such as would have it--the lost dominion.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are now in the early dawn of the Millennial day.  It is the day of all man's week (7,000 years) the best; the only one in which right will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rule</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and wrong be fully subjected, and man will be restored by natural processes to the perfection once lost by the disobedience of one man, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to which has been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redeemed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the obedience of the man Christ Jesus (`Rom. 5:18`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">During this Millennial age Jesus and his Bride, spiritual beings--no longer men--will be personally present, directing and overruling the affairs of earth, but invisible to men, as angels have been in the past.  As Satan and his angels (present--invisible--yet ruling among men) have used Rome as so willing an agent that it is scripturally called by his name--the devil and Satan--so this spiritual kingdom of God will operate through restored fleshly Israel, and find in it so willing an agency that it will be properly called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">also</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the kingdom of God, and will extend its borders righteously, as the Roman counterfeit has attempted to do unrighteously, until the kingdom shall fill the whole earth.  Then shall be fulfilled the prayer of the Master, &quot;Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done in earth as in heaven.&quot;  And man restored shall plant and build and long enjoy the work of their hands, for &quot;the earth abideth forever.&quot;  God &quot;made it not in vain; he made it to be inhabited.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When sin and Adamic death are wiped out, and all its traces removed, and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorrigible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> destroyed in the second death, then man, being in the condition in which he was first created --an image of his Creator, and possessed of an experimental knowledge of both good and evil--will be in proper condition to receive and rightly use the first dominion.  Then the dominion will be delivered up to God, even the Father, by the accountability of men being made thereafter directly to Jehovah, instead of to Jesus as during the Millennial age (`John 5:22`).  During that age the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son, his agent--man's purchaser --Redeemer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus we get a glimpse of God's plan for bringing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">many</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sons to glory--some to the glory of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature and some to the Divine nature.  But the glory of the terrestrial (earthly) is one thing and the glory of the celestial (heavenly) is another thing entirely (`1 Cor. 15:40`).  Surely we can say that it is a plan worthy of our God--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">full</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Wisdom, Love and Power.  &quot;Oh, the depths of the riches both of the knowledge and wisdom of God!&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand that now we are in the dawn of the glorious day--it is not yet sunrise--(the shining forth of the Church, `Matt. 13:43`), but the &quot;Day Star&quot; (Jesus) has arisen in our hearts-- we know of his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--and the sunshine will, ere long, dispel the darkness and storm with which this day opens. That this Millennial era commences with a time of trouble, and the pouring out of symbolic plagues and vials, we believe and teach; and we incline to the belief that the trouble and distress will be of a sort at first little appreciated by many.  First, the nominal Churches--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">systems</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--having filled their mission are due to be destroyed.  Secondly, earthly kingdoms, having served their purpose, are vessels of wrath fitted for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">destruction</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 9:22`); and mankind, long held in bonds of ignorance, under oppression and superstition, is to be released and prepared for their experience with good during Messiah's reign.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As this Gospel age is the time for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">trial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of those called to the heavenly nature--the Church--so the Millennial age is to be the time of judgment--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">trial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of mankind--to determine who of them are worthy of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> perfection and the dominion of earth.  It will be the time of trial of earth's dead, as well as those living, when that age begins.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">It would not be difficult to form a tolerably complete dictionary, of the meaning of the Apocalyptic symbols, by placing over-against each, passages of Scripture in which the same symbol is employed in contexts which indicate its meaning; or in historical narratives, ceremonial observances, or legal enactments, which throw light upon it.  To search the Scriptures, is to find the solution of many a difficulty in this book, for it is more closely related to the rest of the Bible than would by superficial readers be supposed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We proceed, however, briefly to examine two of the leading prophecies of the `Revelation`, a clear understanding of which is, of itself, sufficient to determine its whole scope and character. They are two of the most important symbolizations in the entire series, they occupy several whole chapters, and are alluded to in others; they are closely related to each other, and one of them is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divinely interpreted.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This is the vision of BABYLON THE GREAT, in the `seventeenth chapter` of the book, a prophecy which, by its synchronical connection with almost all the other predictions of the Apocalypse, furnishes a most valuable clue to the meaning and application of the whole series of visions.  This prophecy has besides, a solemn practical importance, rendering it peculiarly needful that it should be rightly interpreted.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Immediately prior to the fall of Babylon, described in the `18th chapter` of Revelation, a voice from heaven cries, &quot;Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, that ye receive not of her plagues; for her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.&quot;  Is it not all-important that Christian people should be very clear as to the system thus solemnly denounced by a voice from heaven?  And similarly, immediately after the fall of Babylon, &quot;a great voice, as of much people in heaven,&quot; is heard saying, with reference to it, &quot;Alleluia; salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.  And again they said Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.&quot;...</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The depravity attributed to &quot;Babylon the Great,&quot; the peculiarly solemn adjuration to God's people to come out of her, and the utter and awful destruction denounced against her, all combine to attach great practical importance to the inquiry, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">what system is intended by</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this symbol?</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A perusal of the `17th and 18th chapters` of the Book of Revelation shows that &quot;Babylon the Great&quot; represents a system which should last long, exert a subtle and extensive influence, and be guilty of exceeding iniquity and cruelty. This system must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">still be in existence,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seeing its destruction takes place simultaneously with &quot;the marriage of the Lamb,&quot; an event which we know to be still future; and seeing also that up to the moment of its destruction, or very nearly so, children of God will be found more or less connected with it, so that a need will exist for the urgent call, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Come out of her, my people.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This system is prefigured as a cruelly persecuting one, as one that would &quot;shed the blood of saints and martyrs of Jesus,&quot; one on whom the Lord God would &quot;avenge the blood of his servants.&quot; The Lord Jesus Christ, who loves his Church, foreseeing the existence and career of this terrible system, forewarned, and thus fore-armed her by this prophecy.  He furnishes her with abundant marks whereby the foe may be recognized, and solemnly warns her against making any truce or compromise, while he stimulates and encourages her for the long and bitter conflict by a view of the final result.  He would have his people in no perplexity or doubt on so momentous a question, so he has made this prediction peculiarly clear; has placed it in marked and intentional </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">contrast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with another prophecy, which makes its meaning still clearer; and he has added besides, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">an explanation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which leaves no room for the candid student to err.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let the reader note the contrasted features of the two symbolic prefigurations:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THE WHORE THAT SITTETH UPON MANY WATERS.&quot; &quot;BABYLON THE GREAT.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;There came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying, Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment of THE GREAT WHORE that sitteth upon many waters.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.  And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, BABYLON THE GREAT, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus&quot; (`Rev. 17:1-6`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THE BRIDE, THE LAMB'S WIFE.&quot; &quot;THE HOLY JERUSALEM.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;There came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee THE BRIDE, the Lamb's wife.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me&quot; (the bride, the Lamb's wife, under another symbol). (`Rev. 21`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints&quot; (`Rev. 19:8`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This Bride is described as &quot;THE HOLY JERUSALEM descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God; and her light like unto a stone most precious&quot; (`Revelation 21`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The dragon &quot;persecuted the woman,&quot; and &quot;the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ&quot; (`Rev. 12:13-17`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R472 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As to Babylon John adds, &quot;when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel?  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will tell thee the mystery of the woman.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ...The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. The waters are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues....And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth&quot; (`Rev. 17:7`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These prophecies present two broadly contrasted </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">women,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> identified with two broadly contrasted </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cities,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one reality being in each case, doubly represented as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a woman,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a city.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The harlot and Babylon are one; the Bride and the heavenly Jerusalem are one.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is evident that the true interpretation of either of these double prefigurations must afford a clue to the true interpretation of the other.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The two women are contrasted in every particular that is mentioned about them; the one is as pure as purity itself, &quot;made ready&quot; and fit for heaven's unsullied holiness; the other, foul as corruption could make her, fit only for the fires of destruction.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The one belongs to the Lamb, who loves her as the bridegroom loves the bride; the other is associated with a wild beast, and with the kings of the earth, who ultimately hate and destroy her.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The one is clothed with fine linen-- righteousness; the other is attired in scarlet and gold, in jewels and pearls, gorgeous indeed, but with earthly splendor only.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The one is represented as a chaste virgin, espoused to Christ; the other is mother of harlots and abominations of the earth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The one is persecuted, pressed hard by the dragon, driven into the wilderness, and well-nigh overwhelmed; the other is drunken with martyr blood, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seated on</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a beast which has received its power from the persecuting dragon.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The one sojourns in solitude in the wilderness, the other &quot;reigns in the wilderness&quot; over peoples, and nations, and kindreds, and tongues.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The one goes in with the Lamb to the marriage supper, amid the glad hallelujahs of heaven; the other is stripped, insulted, torn, and destroyed, by her guilty paramours.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We lose sight of the Bride amid the effulgence of heavenly glory and joy, and of the harlot amid the gloom and darkness of the smoke that &quot;rose up for ever and ever.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is impossible to find in Scripture a contrast more marked; and the conclusion is irresistible, that whatever one may represent, the other must prefigure </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">its opposite.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They are not disconnected visions, but a pair--a pair associated, not by likeness, but by contrast.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, Scripture leaves us in no doubt as to the signification of the emblematic bride, the Lamb's wife, the heavenly Jerusalem.  We read, &quot;Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.&quot; &quot;For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.&quot;  The purpose of Christ's love, as regards his blood-bought church is, that she should be with him, and be one with him forever; that she should behold and share his glory, being perfectly conformed to his image.  Here, in prophetic vision, we see this blessed design accomplished, and the complete and perfectly sanctified church, clad in spotless robes of righteousness, brought to the marriage supper of the Lamb.  We see her persecuted like her Lord, and like her Lord and with her Lord, glorified.  Beyond all question, the New Jerusalem bride represents </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the true church of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What then must the contrasted symbol, the Babylonian harlot, represent? </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Surely some false and apostate church,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> some church which, while professing to belong to Christ, is in reality given up to fellowship with the world, and linked in closest union with the kings of the earth; a worldly church, which has left her first love, forgotten her heavenly calling, sunk into carnality and sin, and proved shamelessly and glaringly faithless to her Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Be it observed, that these symbols, a woman and a city, prefigure definite systems, corporate bodies, not merely a multitude of similar but disconnected individuals.  The tares of a wheat-field, the bad fish in the net, may represent such; but here we have neither true Christians nor worldly professors, as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">individuals,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but two corporations, two definite bodies.  The true church of Christ is a body; its members are united in the closest union to their Head and to each other; one life animates them: &quot;Because I live, ye shall live also;&quot; one spirit dwells in them; they are one habitation of God.  The link that unites them is, however, a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one; the body is consequently visible </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as such.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> A false church can have no such spiritual link.  The bond that unites </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must therefore be carnal, outward, visible; the church represented by Babylon must be a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">visible church,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an earthly corporation, and as such capable of being discerned and recognized.... The woman and the city are one--if we can discover the name of the city, we shall be able to identify the church intended.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The last words of the angel to John seem to leave no possibility of mistake as to the city.  &quot;The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth....And the woman which thou sawest is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that great city which reigneth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">over the kings of the earth.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  What city was that?  There was but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> great city which, in John's day, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reigned over</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the kings of the earth.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It was ROME: and Rome is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> city that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> great then, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">has been</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> great--in one way or other ever since, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so still.  And Rome was seated on seven hills--&quot;the seven mountains on which the woman sitteth.&quot;  Her common name with the classic writers of St. John's age, is &quot;the seven hilled city;&quot; an annual festival used to be held in honor of the &quot;seven hilled city;&quot; every Latin poet of note, during a period of five hundred years, alludes to Rome's seven hills.  The medals and coins of the day </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">represent</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rome</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a woman sitting on seven hills; and her titles show, with sufficient clearness, how thoroughly she </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reigned.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  She was styled &quot;the royal Rome;&quot; &quot;the mistress of the world;&quot; &quot;the queen of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R472 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">nations.&quot;  Her sway was all but universal. She was the metropolis of that fourth great empire which Daniel had foretold would break in pieces and subdue all things, &quot;dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly;&quot; and, at the time of the Apocalyptic visions, her power was at its height.  Rome, and no other city, can be intended here; the woman is in some way identified with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rome.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We previously saw that she must represent a church; now we know what church.  The harlot is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of Rome;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for simple minds there seems no escape from this conclusion.  &quot;The woman which thou sawest is that great </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">city&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;which reigneth over the kings of the earth.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The question, however, naturally suggests itself, If the woman be identified in some way with ROME, why is her brow emblazoned with the name of BABYLON?  The answer is evident; the Apocalypse is a book of mysteries; things are represented by signs; realities are veiled; and it would have been altogether inconsistent with the whole style of this prophecy to have written ROME on the harlot's brow.  The woman is a figure of the church, a corrupt, idolatrous church; that is, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">symbol</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seen by John was suggestive of something widely different from itself; so the name with which the symbol was stamped, was also suggestive of something widely different from itself, though mysteriously similar.  The harlot is &quot;Mystery, Babylon the Great.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The above extracts are from the pen of an English writer.  We supplement them as follows:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Names were formerly given as expressions of character or work; as, for instance, Mary was commanded to call her child's name Jesus, which means deliverer or saviour, because he should </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">save his people</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from their sins.  The name Babylon, applied by the Spirit to the Church of Rome, expresses her character for Babylon means mixture-- confusion (see `Lev. 18:23`).  This union of the woman (church) with the beast (empire) constitutes the spiritual harlotry of which she is guilty.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the same (Babylon) applies to her entire family; her daughters inherit both her nature and name, for she is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;mother</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of harlots,&quot; and her works they do.  Some of her daughters have followed very closely in her footsteps, in mixing Church and State.  Such are &quot;The Church of England&quot; and other State Churches.  And such would other daughters be, also, if they could find empires willing to support them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The same spirit of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">confusion</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the Church walking in unlawful union with the world--is seen on every hand.  The Church (nominal) and the world walk hand in hand, unite their interests, and make merry together.  It is the worldly element and its wealth that is sought by every sect to support and sustain the Church in the degree of luxury she wishes to enjoy.  Alas, the name Babylon is emblazoned on the brow of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sectarian system</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the world over!  Yet they all, like the mother system, hold forth &quot;a golden cup (the Word of God) full of abomination </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Greek, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">kai.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">) the filthiness of their fornication,&quot; without a blush for their shame, and, in fact, ignorant of the fact that it condemns them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the cup of Divine indignation is now full.  The Lord will have pity and patience no longer, and though, until this harvest time, he permitted wheat and tares to grow together, the imperative command now is, &quot;Come out of her, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">my people.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The magnet of truth is gathering out the Jewels, and the reproaches of the world and the nominal Church are refining and fitting them for</font><br />
<br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the Master's use.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He is thus seeking out the &quot;little flock&quot;--the true Church--whose names are written in heaven, who, during his absence, have waited for him, searched carefully every letter of his, which would inform them of his coming and glory, and of his will concerning them; those who have made and performed the sacrifice of earthly interests, to secure with him the higher and more enduring pleasures and honors than any which the world can offer.  Yes, &quot;They shall be mine, saith the Lord, in that day when I make up my jewels&quot; (`Mal. 3:16,17`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Cyrus, who conquered the typical Babylon, and set free the typical Israel in bondage in her, is undoubtedly a type of Christ.  In the overthrow of the type, not only was the capitol city (Babylon) overthrown, but the empire with all its provinces and cities.  So, too, Babylon here is to fall, and it implies not merely the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">great</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> city--the capitol and leading system of the apostate Church (the Roman Church)--but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> under the rule of the world--all of the mixture, all of the confusion-- mother and daughters.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is Babylon that falls and is dashed in pieces in this day of the Lord, but the true and faithful virgin shall be gathered and made perfect, and, as the Bride and joint-heir, shall share Christ's glory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Dear is this Church to God,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Her walls before him stand;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">====================</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R473 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE CONSUMMATION OF OUR HOPE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of the Lord's dear children, sorely pressed by the adversary and longing for the glorious consummation of our hope, anxiously inquire how long must we tarry here, and in what manner shall we go?  For these, and for refreshing the memory of all, we briefly review what the Scriptures teach on this subject.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been an old and cherished idea with Christian people, and ourselves among others, based on a misunderstanding of some scriptures, and an overlooking of others, that those who remain unto the coming of the Lord should not pass through the ordeal of physical death.  We took more interest in this thought than other Christians, because we had learned that we were living in the day of the Lord's presence.  We never claimed this as new truth, however; it was simply an old idea applied to the time in which we learned we were living, which idea we had not discovered to be erroneous until a little over a year ago.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The scriptures upon which that idea has been based, when critically considered, do not (in our judgment) support the thought; and other scriptures seem to teach positively that all who will be members of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--Christ-- must like their head, example, forerunner, die physically.  Carefully examine the subject in the light of the following remarks on texts usually regarded as the basis of the idea that some will be exempted from physical death:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In `1 Thes. 4:15,17`, we read: &quot;That we which are alive and remain unto the coming </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(parousia--presence)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lord shall not prevent [precede] them which are asleep.  For the Lord... shall descend...and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together [or also] with [or to] them, &amp;c.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now we do not claim that anything here mentioned indicates that the saints, as new creatures, who remain over to this time of the Lord's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but we do claim that nothing in this text teaches that their human bodies will not die.  This scripture does not mention what </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they will undergo before being joined to the Lord; in fact the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not mentioned here at all. But the same apostle elsewhere informs us that a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must take place, because &quot;flesh and blood&quot; cannot inherit the kingdom of God--we must all be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;changed&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to spiritual bodies.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us next look at `1 Cor. 15:51`, for it mentions the change particularly, and let us notice carefully whether Paul says we shall be changed without </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dying,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as we have always supposed he does. We read: &quot;Behold I show you a mystery; we shall not all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleep,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but we shall all be changed.  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye;...the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We received the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impression</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that our earthly body would not die, from the above statement regarding </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleep,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but the human body might be dissolved and we--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new creatures</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --be delivered from it so quickly, clothed upon with our spiritual body, that not a moment for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleep</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would intervene. If time should intervene between the dissolution of our earthly house (human nature) and the receiving of our spiritual body, we should be obliged to sleep, as the apostles and &quot;all who sleep in Jesus.&quot;  But that sleep has always been an undesirable thing; therefore with the Apostle we can say that we are anxious, not to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unclothed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(asleep</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> without either human or spiritual body), but we prefer, if the will of God be such, that we should be of the class alive when the Lord has come, so that, instead of being even for a moment in the unclothed (or sleep) condition, we might be clothed upon, or receive the spiritual at the same moment we part with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">old</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> human house.  And this in substance Paul here states--all will not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleep,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for to some the change will be in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One thing is sure, we must leave the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sometime, and whenever or however it may be, it will be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or dissolution and end of the human to all who become full recipients of the divine nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, notice the words of Jesus concerning John.  John, we have long since seen to be a type or representative of the last part of the church--those who are alive and remain unto the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lord and who shall be changed. Jesus said of our representative, John: &quot;If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee, Peter?  Then went that saying abroad among the disciples, that that disciple should </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not die;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> howbeit, Jesus said not that he should not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but if I will that he tarry till I come,&quot; &amp;c. (`John 21:22`).  Just so, dear brethren, it has been with the company typified by John; the saying has gone abroad and has been generally received that this part of the church will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not die.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Howbeit, when we examine the evidences, we find that neither Jesus nor the apostles said we should </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not die,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but that we would tarry till the Master's presence and be changed in a moment and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not sleep.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, notice the positive teaching that all of &quot;the body&quot; will die, and then mark the necessity of death.  It was no less an authority than Paul who said: If we be dead with him we shall also live with him; and if we have been planted in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection, therefore we are to be made conformable unto his death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Does some one object that these words are applicable to the daily life of Paul and of us and suggest that we are to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;living</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sacrifices?&quot;  Very true, but while our dying commences at our consecration, it does not end there.  As in the case of our &quot;Captain,&quot; it does not end until the human is dead.  While we begin, as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;living</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sacrifices,&quot; yet, when the sacrifice is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">finished,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all that is human is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The thing that dies at once is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human will,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and when this is accomplished we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckon</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ourselves dead; but the death actually is in progress day by day until the sacrifice is complete.  We cannot receive the spiritual mind unless we surrender the human mind or will, so also we cannot receive our spiritual body unless the earthly body is surrendered.  Remember that Jesus said to all the churches: &quot;Be thou faithful unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and I will give thee a crown of life.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is in harmony with these thoughts that we understand the words of Jesus (`John 11:26`): &quot;Whosoever liveth (at this time) and believeth in me [or is one of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ful] shall never die.&quot;  The class referred to are reckoned </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the human will, nature, hope, etc., and are alive toward God as new creatures. Such </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new creatures</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who are now living will not sleep--will not die--but immediately, in the twinkling of an eye, will be transferred to their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body like unto Christ's spiritual body.  What matters it to us, if the earthly house of this building be dissolved in death, we shall not be unclothed but clothed upon with an heavenly one.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, as we have seen, that in Jesus' case the human was surrendered to death forever, (He was &quot;put to death in the flesh but quickened in spirit&quot;), and that, had he taken back the human nature, it would have been taking back our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom price,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so we have seen that it is a privilege granted to us as his body, to fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ--to share in the world's redemption, with him who loved us and bought us with his own precious blood--to suffer with him, being made conformable unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In a word, if Jesus must needs be obedient </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">even</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unto death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and if he says to us: &quot;Be thou faithful </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unto death,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> then it is clear that the dissolution or death of the human being is necessary.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we find still more positive teaching on this point.  Turning to `Psa. 82:6`, we read: &quot;I--I (Jehovah) have said God's ye are, and sons of the Most High all of you; but as man ye die, and as one of the heads ye fall&quot; (Young's Trans).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our high calling is so great, so much above the comprehension of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that they think we are guilty of blasphemy</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R474 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">when we speak of being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> creatures&quot; --&quot;partakers of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine nature.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> When we claim, on the scriptural warrant, that we are begotten to a divine nature and that Jehovah is thus our father, it is claiming that we are divine beings--hence all such are Gods.  True, we are only in the embryo condition, now spiritually minded, but by-and-by we shall be perfected.  Thus there is a family of Gods, Jehovah being our father, and all his sons on the divine plane, being brethren and joint-heirs: Jesus being the chief or first-born.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor should we wonder that so few discern this grand relationship, into the full membership of which we so soon hope to come.  The apostle tells us that &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God... </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">neither can he know them,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> because they are spiritually discerned&quot; (`1 Cor. 2:14`). Just so it was when our great Head and Lord was among men. Having consecrated the human at 30 years of age, he was begotten of the spirit, and became a part-taker of the divine nature.  When Jesus said he was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a son of God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Jews were about to stone him, reasoning thus, that if a son of God, he was making himself to be also a God, or of the God family. [Just what we claim: &quot;Beloved, now are we the sons of God&quot;--&quot;The God and father of our Lord Jesus hath begotten us.&quot;] (`1 John 3:2` and `1 Pet. 1:3`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus does not deny that when he said he was a son, he implied that he was of the divine nature, but he quotes to them the above passage from the Psalms as being good authority, and it seems as though it satisfied them, for they did not stone him.  Jesus said, &quot;Is it not written in your law, I said ye are Gods?&quot; Then he proceeds to show that the &quot;Gods&quot; there mentioned, are the ones who receive obediently his words and example, and concludes his argument by asking whether if God calls such ones as receive his (Jesus') teachings, Gods, whether they think that he, the teacher, whom the Father had specially set apart as the head of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">those Gods,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could be properly said to blaspheme, when he claimed the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> relationship as a son of God (`John 10:35`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These sons of God, like him from whom they heard the word of truth by which they are begotten, are yet in disguise; the world knoweth us not for the same reason that it knew him not. Our Father puts no outward badge or mark of our high relationship, but leaves each to walk by faith and not by sight all through the earthly pilgrimage --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">down into</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> death.  His favor and love and the glory and honor which belong to our station, we can now see by the eye of faith; but soon it will be realized in fact.  Now we appear like </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and as men all die, even as others; but in the resurrection we will rise in our true character as Gods--partakers of the Divine nature (`2 Peter 1:4`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;It doth not yet appear</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       How great we shall be made;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  But when we see him as he is,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       We shall be like our Head.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How forcibly this is expressed by the prophet, and how sure it is, too!  Jesus says--it cannot be broken.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then the whole Christ--head and body--are addressed as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as they</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R474 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">will be under Christ their head, saying: &quot;Arise, O God, judge [rule, bless] the earth; for thou shalt inherit all nations.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We, as new creatures, who are living in this favored time of the Lord's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> expect to be translated, or changed to our own spiritual condition, but we expect the change to take place at the moment of the death of the &quot;earthen vessel&quot;--we will not be obliged to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleep</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as did the new creature Paul and others, but will be &quot;changed in a moment.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of this favored time Jesus told us in words never understood until due, saying: &quot;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">from henceforth:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; but their works follow with them&quot; (`Rev. 14:13`--E.D.).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Uniformly throughout the Bible, except in this one instance, death is represented as a dreadful disaster, a terrible enemy, a devouring monster, and the grave as a great prison, permitted of our loving Heavenly Father, only because men had become sinners and must be destroyed.  And the great hope held out before the world has been, that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> having given himself a ransom for the sinners --having &quot;tasted </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> every man --the just for the unjust--will soon commence the great work of destroying </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by restoring all mankind to life. Thus will he &quot;swallow up </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in victory.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:54`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When he has exalted his church to the glory of kingdom (symbol, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mountain,)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> power, then he will spread before </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all people</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a great feast, and, through this kingdom, (mountain) he will destroy the vail of ignorance and the covering of death--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;He will swallow up death in victory&quot; (`Isa. 25:6-8`). Then he will break open and abolish the great prison-house of death and set at liberty all the captives.  Of this deliverance to the captives and opening of the prison doors to them that are bound, Jesus preached, saying, The day is coming in the which all that are in their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">graves</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall hear the voice of the Son of man and come forth (`John 5:28`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul recognizes death as the greatest of all enemies, and, speaking of Christ's Millennial reign, he says: &quot;He must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet: The last </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enemy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that shall be destroyed is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Cor. 15:25,26`). It is the same Apostle who, speaking of the object of Jesus' coming into the world and dying for our sins, says that he took the human nature, that &quot;through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil&quot; (`Heb. 2:14`).  It is also affirmed that he will open the prison doors of them that are bound (captives of death) and proclaim liberty to the captives (`Isa. 61:1`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In view of the general expression of enmity to death in the Scriptures, the above solitary text, speaking of it as a blessing, is rather peculiar, until we notice, that the application is limited by the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;henceforth.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Not always, but henceforth, death may be a blessing.  But, notice another limitation. It will not henceforth be a blessing to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> mankind, but only to those &quot;in the Lord&quot;--members in particular of the body of Christ, the little flock, to whom it is the Father's good pleasure to give the kingdom--to all others </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will continue to be an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enemy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until its final destruction in the Millennial reign (`Hos. 13:14`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, it is unusual to speak of those already </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as dying; but the Spirit uses this seemingly incongruous expression, evidently desiring to limit the application of the death blessing to a certain class: &quot;Blessed are the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [those dead to the world--crucified with Christ --&quot;Ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God,&quot;] </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">henceforth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who die in the Lord.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we are full of interest to know when, from what time forward, will it be blessed, for the special class mentioned, to die.  These words were written for our edification, and we should be able to know </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">when</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they apply, especially if we are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Lord and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the world; for it was part of our Master's promise that the Spirit should guide us into an understanding of the truth, and show us things to come (`John 16:13`). If, as we believe, the last members of the body of Christ are now living --&quot;The feet of him&quot;--it is time that we had an understanding of this passage, which clearly refers to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the feet.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We look backward at the context to ascertain if possible when this blessing is due.  The `seven preceding verses` give, we think, very clear testimony on the subject.  They mention three specific messages which must be proclaimed in the church (symbol, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heaven)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which, we believe, have been in process during the first seven years of harvest just ended, from 1874 to 1881.  The first message embodies not only the agelasting good news (Gospel) but also the time element.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> HOUR </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judgment is come.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This is precisely what was preached by quite a goodly number of us, viz.: that the glad tidings of great joy should yet be unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all people,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;harvest,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of trial, (judgment) commenced with 1874, and would last for forty years--the first seven years being specially devoted to the church for the harvesting of the first-fruits.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You will recall that up to 1878, though Restitution was the key note, and entire consecration was always urged, yet the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> element was one of the most prominent features always. Since 1878, however, though the same time element is recognized in all our preaching and teaching, and is repeatedly referred to as a proof of our position, yet the direct teaching of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has almost stopped among all the preaching brethren--and this, too, without any preconcerted arrangement, and without any other reason than that other elements of truth came into greater prominence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was in the spring of 1879 that, seeing clearly the parallelism between the nominal Jewish church and the nominal Gospel church, we were enabled to know just where the latter was finally rejected of the Lord and spued out of his mouth (`Rev. 3:10`), no longer to be his mouthpiece.  We saw that this was due in 1878, as the parallel of the rejection of the Jewish church, when Jesus, just prior to his crucifixion, wept over them and said: &quot;Your house is left unto you desolate.&quot;  The Jewish church was there likewise cast off, or spued from his mouth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We were led to see very clearly that the nominal church of the Gospel Age is Babylon, (the confused, mixed condition of worldly-mindedness and lukewarm Christianity), described in `Rev. 18:2-4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This spuing out, or casting off, of the nominal church as an organization</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R475 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">in 1878, we then understood, and still proclaim, to be the date of the commencement of Babylon's fall, as recorded there.  And since then we feel ourselves led of the Spirit, through the unfolding of this portion of the word of truth, to say, in the name of the Lord, to all God's true children in Babylon: &quot;Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and receive not of her plagues&quot; (`verse 4`).  This seems to accord wonderfully with the second message, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Babylon is fallen&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rev. 14:8`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The third message (`14:9-11`), was that concerning the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">worshipers of the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Beast and his Image</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--showing the nominal church in the colors in which the Word of God paints it, pointing out how all who remain in her, either in spirit or name, in opposition to the Word of God, saying, &quot;Come out of her,&quot; will be subject to torment and vexation so long as they are worshiping creeds and doctrines and organizations of men, the remembrance of which distress (smoke of torment) will never be forgotten.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As with the preceding two, so with this third message--it could not have been more accurately fulfilled than it was.  [And here we would remark, that the resemblance of the teachings of our company, to the messages here given, was only noticed after they had been proclaimed].  All three of these messages yet continue, and will doubtless continue to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">repeated</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by others so long as they contain truth due to the Lord's children; but, as special messages in the sense referred to in the prediction of the Revelator, they had all been given before the fall of 1881, and this was the time which corresponded with the end of the seventieth week of Daniel's prophecy.  Since then we are in the time of patient waiting for our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;change&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> described in `verse 12`.  And here it was in the fall of 1881 that, for the first time, we were able to read understandingly the words, &quot;Blessed are the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who die in the Lord from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">henceforth.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Evidently the blessing is to the members of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ now living.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, we inquire, in what respect will death be a blessing to us now?  We answer, that now we shall not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleep,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but we will be instantly invested with our heavenly (spiritual) bodies, being changed in a moment, dropping all that is human and earthly, and being clothed upon with our heavenly condition.  In the case of Jesus, there were nearly three days of sleep--the unclothed, unconscious, dead condition between the times when the earthly body was resigned and the heavenly body was received. Paul and others have been nearly two thousand years waiting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;unclothed,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or &quot;asleep in Jesus,&quot; and this is one of the principal reasons why death was undesirable even to Christians.  We don't wish to be unclothed, even for a moment, but we do desire to be clothed upon, or to have the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an instantaneous one (`1 Cor. 15:52`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Herein consists the blessing to those of the body now taken.  Death to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will be instantaneous with the perfecting of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature, hence it will be a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">blessed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;change.&quot;  &quot;Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; but their works follow </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To the class thus &quot;blessed,&quot; there will be no interruption of work.  Already dead to the world and alive toward God, their work is in harmony with the kingdom work now going on, and they merely step to their higher plane of &quot;divine&quot; perfection and power, and there continue the same work.  It is only the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">labor (toil,)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> incident to the mortal body--the frail &quot;earthen vessel&quot; which ceases.  Not so highly favored in this regard was the lot of any of the members of &quot;the body&quot; which preceded us.  Quite a period elapsed in Paul's case between sufferings and glory. When he had fought a good fight and finished his course he looked forward, not to a change in a moment, but to a sleep from which he would be awakened to receive his reward in the kingdom. So he expresses his hope.  &quot;Henceforth there is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">laid up for me</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a crown of life which the Lord, the Righteous Judge, shall give me </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">at that day&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`2 Tim. 4:8`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;How beautiful are the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">feet</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Him,&quot; how many favors and blessings are for us.  Truly, &quot;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">henceforth:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors and their works follow with them.&quot;  Rejoice and be exceeding glad --but</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Ne'er think the victory won,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Nor once at ease sit down;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Thine arduous task will not be done,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Till thou hast gained thy crown.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The human must be entirely sacrificed before the divine is perfected-- &quot;Be thou faithful </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unto death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and I will give thee a crown of life,&quot; are the words of our Lord and Forerunner in whose footsteps on the narrow way, we must follow, to gain the prize of our high calling--&quot;Glory, Honor and Immortality.&quot;</font><br />
<br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now abideth faith, hope, and charity.-- `1 Cor. 13:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Behold this string of pearls, the coronet of diamonds.  Each pearl sparkles with the luster of its own individuality. Of the three it is written, &quot;Now abideth faith, hope, love.&quot;  Of love it is declared, &quot;But the greatest of these is charity.&quot;  Love the most brilliant of the group; more exalted than her companions: yet Faith, Hope, Love, all essential to vital godliness.  There can be no religious experience without these. One cannot be substituted for the other. Like a railroad permit, or passport, they are not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">transferable.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  These three graces have their places in the experience of every child of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Notice the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">order.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Faith is foundational. Hope and Love resultant.  This is the Divine arrangement, this God's order.  A man is according to his Faith.  It is the root of this tree of experience; the vehicle God uses to reveal himself by his Spirit to man's interior nature.  &quot;According to your Faith be it unto you.&quot;  &quot;Without Faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Simple as Faith is in the abstract, yet God has been pleased to honor it with results which are glorious.  A little girl was asked once the question, &quot;What is Faith?&quot; to which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">she</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> replied, &quot;Trusting God and asking no questions.&quot;  That simple, brief answer gives a correct idea of the simplicity of Faith, and, when exercised, brings results.  A Scripture or two: &quot;Therefore, being justified by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Faith,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom, also, we have access by Faith unto this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience: and patience experience, and experience </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hope,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and hope maketh not ashamed because the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.&quot; (`Rom. 5:1,5`).  The apostle Paul prayed for a certain church that their faith fail not.  He knew if their Faith was gone, all would be gone.  The apostle Peter regarded Faith as the basis of character, and the unit in spiritual addition, and besides this, giving all diligence, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;add to your faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> virtue, and to virtue (courage) knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">charity.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (`2 Peter 1:5-8`). How needed the injunction of holy writ, &quot;Have faith in God.&quot;  Hope springs from faith, and waits for the accomplishment of faith's object.  &quot;Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&quot;  Hope comes by experience. A man without hope is like a world without the sun.  Hope flings a bow upon the stormiest cloud, kindles a fire in the coldest bosom, and blooms in every soil.  While I breathe I hope--is the motto of the race.  To expect, when circumstances are at their worst, that they will become better--aye, and better at their best--is as natural as to breathe. The object of the hope referred to in this wonderful group is the appearing of Christ to receive his bride, and transform them into his likeness.  &quot;Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.&quot; (`Titus 2:13-14`).</font><br />
