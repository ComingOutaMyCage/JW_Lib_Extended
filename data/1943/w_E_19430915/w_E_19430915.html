<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act al) men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth” of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&quot;—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JEHOVAH occupies the highest seat as the top-I ranking Educator. All creatures in his image and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font4"> likeness he created to live forever. Whether they live eternally or die depends upon their own choice of conduct. Those who choose everlasting life must give heed to the Highest Educator and learn and apply the instruction from him. The fact is. all true instruction to fit one for endless life in happiness, peace and liberty proceeds from Jehovah God. One wise man, taught by Him, writes: “Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding: he layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to them that walk in integrity.’’ Jehovah God is the Father of all the family of his sons in heaven and in earth. To his sons on earth he says: “My son, forget not my law; but let thy heart keep my commandments: for length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to thee. My son. let them not depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion: so shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thy foot shall not stumble.’’—Prov. 2:6, 7; 3:1. 2. 21-23, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* It is free education that Jehovah provides for those who learn of him. He is interested in their eternal interests. He does not make teaching a profession for his personal maintenance or for selfish gain, but as an expression of his loving-kindness toward those who seek and appreciate eternal life in a free world. He is not dependent upon any or even all creatures for enrichment of himself. Nothing that his learners or disciples might render to their great Teacher could add to his wealth, for all things come of him and only of His own can creatures give unto him. He gives teaching unselfishly, solely for the benefit that his creatures get therefrom. His great delight is in having them receive the instruction and wisely use it and thereby be kept from that which would work against their eternal life. Of him it is recorded for the benefit of those in the way of death: “Why will ye die, 0 house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Those who choose everlasting life must receive and apply education from whom’ and why so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2 . Why is the education he gives to His learners free, and what is his great delight respecting them? </span><span class="font4">the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah: wherefore turn yourselves, and live.” (Ezek. IS: 31, 32, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am.Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> Everlasting life is a free gift from Jehovah God: “for with thee is the fountain of life.” Hence the education he imparts unto life everlasting is likewise free.—Ps. 36: 9, Am. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’ Particularly since the World War of A.D. 1914, a great crisis in education has struck this old world. No one can successfully deny’ that the world’s education before the first World War was faulty and in vain. Otherwise, that world - enveloping conflict would never have come, with its terrible toll of life, and with famines and pestilences as attendant and consequential circumstances. A shaky, imperfect peace followed for two decades, and now all humankind is feeling the shock and ravages of a global war, whose end is not yet and whose total costs in human life and material wealth no one on earth can yet determine. During the twenty-year peace interval there was an attempt made for the revision of human education, and some religionists and politicians and financial-industrial leaders set out to undermine democratic teachings and theories and to indoctrinate the peoples with totalitarian ideas. These new educators of the world, of the Nazi and Fascist and Hierarchy type, gained control in Central Europe. They ruthlessly brought the peoples into their school and made a forced application of their doctrines over the protests of the many who believed otherwise.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah God is the great Teacher of history and has caused vital history to be written in advance, in the form of prophecy. He foretold the aggressions of that school of religious, political and social regimentation of humankind. In the the prophecy of Daniel, chapter eleven, He described the totalitarian power and its allies under the name or symbol of “the king of the north”, because its seat lies at Rome, including Vatican City, and it was north of Egypt. Egypt was for many centuries the seat of “the king of the south”, whose present allies and protectors include espe-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3 . How ha* a great crisis Id education struck this old world since A.D. 1914?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4 Of w hat branch of learning is Jehovah the great Teacher, and oa such how baa he described the aggressions of the totalitarian school of regimentation </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1 </span><span class="font4">cially Great Britain and the United States. Describing the encroachments of the totalitarian “king of the north” upon the many fields of human thought, interest and endeavor, the prophecy says: “In his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain. He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: ... He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries.”—Dan. 11: 38, 39, 41, 42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Not only did the total-state “king of the north” invade and overthrow the &quot;land” or field of liberal government in Italy, but he also, with the aid of religious hierarchs and their political and financial puppets, invaded the field of republican government in Germany. There he abolished the young democracy and set up a nationalist dictatorship in the hands of a religionist. Just a matter of months thereafter, namely, on July 20,1933, the Nazi dictator concluded a concordat with the Vatican for the protection and advancement of its religious interests. What followed the concordat is now well-known history.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">• “The king of the north” promptly invaded the field of national education and thought and caused the libraries, universities and public schools to be purged of their books and writings of liberal, democratic and freedom-loving thought and to be burned or otherwise disposed of. Not only the field of secular education felt the flaming fury of the concordat partners, but also the field of Bible education. The Central European branch of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, with offices at Magdeburg, Germany, was banned and Jehovah’s witnesses were decreed to be an “unlawful society”. The Nazi dictatorship made the possession of the Watchtower Bible publications to be a crime, and on one occasion treated the public to the spectacle of burning 50 thousand copies of them at one time. In like spirit the totalitarian dictator of Spain, who was put in power with the aid of the Nazi-Fascist-religious dictators. caused 110,000 copies of the Bible, shipped from Britain for distribution in Spain, to be seized and ground to pulp; and this was as recently as October, 1940.—New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> October 6, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> The invisible demons under Satan, “the prince of the demons,” are back of such assaults upon the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">5. What fields of government did “the king of the north” invade, and how did he tie in with the religious interests in 1933?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">C How did “the king of the north” invade the field of national education and thought? and how did his conduct toward the Watchtower Society and the Bible show a further invasion?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">7. Who are back of such assaults upon public instruction, and what is their fixed purpose, as disclosed in the Nazi dictator's February 24 proclamation? </span><span class="font4">instruction of the people in the Word of Jehovah God. The Bible plainly discloses that “the king of the north” is under the power of the demons and serves the Devil’s scheme for universal domination to the exclusion of Jehovah God. (Dan. 11: 36, 45) The Bible further discloses that the fixed purpose of the demons is to re-educate the entire human race in the totalitarian ideas and methods and to drive the unwilling ones, under, apparently, sheer necessity of self-defense, into totalitarian rule, even though it be under another name less suspicious and hateful to the people. In straight terms the Nazi dictator of the “king of the north” combine voiced this aim of the demons, in his proclamation of February 24, read for him at a party meeting in Munich and also broadcast and recorded: “The Nazi world of ideas will become the common property of all peoples, even our enemies, through this struggle. One State after another will be increasingly compelled to resort to the National Socialist thesis in the conduct of the war they provoked.”—New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> 2/25/43.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’ Many thoughtful men and women who are enemies of “the king of the north” now express the fear that his boast is what is actually taking place, as they witness the successive steps being taken by an “administration with its form of bureaucratic and despotic government, ruling by decree and edict, in place of orderly legislative functioning and constitutional procedure”, to quote one such expression on the subject. (Cincinnati </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Star,</span><span class="font4"> 4/21/43) The president of the United States Chamber of Commerce has issued a warning against “big government”, “super-statism,” saying: “Super-statism is not a bogey of business men’s imagination.” (New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> 3/25/43) And an editor of the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> cries out, “Which path, America!” and concludes his warning, saying: “It might be well to know in advance which way they are leading us. Otherwise we may wake up some day and find that we are the dependent and powerless subjects of a totalitarian state, run by our own brand of ‘New Bureaucrats’.”—New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> 3/14/43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Not merely in the lands overrun by the ruthless “king of the north”, but also in the lands lined up on the side of the democratic “king of the south”, the field of education has been vitally affected and greatly altered and weakened. Especially is this noticeable when considering the teaching staff in the free public schools and non-religious institutions of learning. In America it has been regularly featured for some time in the headlines of the news that the teaching faculties in colleges and universities are hard hit as thousands of these leave the classroom for</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">8. How do some thoughtful persona express the fear that his boast Is what Is actually taking place?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">9. How has the cause of education been affected and weakened also In democratic lands ? </span><span class="font4">some active or more direct part in the global conflict between “the king of the north” and “the Icing of the south”. Many teachers are leaving their posts because their profession is underpaid and they can earn more money at other occupations now inviting workers. A dearth of teachers is feared, as replacements by the younger generation of college graduates are held difficult, due to the war.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> A recent survey by the United States Office of Education disclosed that last spring 106 thousand teachers in rural communities quit; which means one teacher in four; whereas in the cities only one teacher in ten has withdrawn. The teacher shortage is growing very rapidly, and, though some replacements are being made by rehiring retired teachers and by other means, an expected shortage of between 60 and 90 thousand is in sight now. Needless to say that those in need of education with more individual attention and help must suffer. The postwar era is certain to show it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Educators and others are looking ahead to that (to them) “unknown quantity”, the postwar world arrangement. Educational associations are calling for aid to schools by the national government despite the fear of government control of education as' in Nazi Germany. Educational reforms are being called for; sweeping changes in college methods of imparting knowledge are foreseen; hope is expressed that the spirit of liberal-arts education will remain alive; and the re-education, not alone of Germany’s youth, but also of the whole world, is suggested as being the need for permanent peace and security.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The United States Committee on Educational Reconstruction sees “global education” as the urgent need. It argues that just as there was an International Labor Office connected with the League of Nations and joined by the United States, so in the arrangement following this war there should be established an &quot;International Education Office” to repair the damage that has been done to the fields of learning by “the king of the north”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHOSE EDUCATION?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Admitting now the need for global education or re-educating all nations in the coming transition, we must face the question: Whose educational program shall it be? Whose reforms shall they be? With what schools of learning shall those whose education has been interrupted by global war resume their studies? Who shall determine this? According to all past historic precedent it is certain that this will not be</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">10. What does a recent survey by the V. S. Office of Education disclose regarding teachers’’ and *bo must therefore suffer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">11. What measures are being suggested or called for respecting the postwar world arrangement?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">12 What does the C. S. Committee on Educational Reconstruction see as urgently needed, and why’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">13. In answering the questions concerning global education or re-education of nations, who or what will have a guiding voice, and what hints are there of this from America? </span><span class="font4">left to the secular authorities of the victorious nations. Desperate politicians and commercial traffickers and social leaders are now pleading for “more religion”. Certainly religion will have a guiding and controlling voice in the answers to the questions, and particularly that form of religion with headquarters at Vatican City, Italy. It cannot be forgotten that the chief executive of America did, in 1934, declare his intention of opening up diplomatic relations between America and the Vatican as soon as the Americans could be brought around to it, and that he has since sent a personal envoy to the Roman pontiff and now has an American </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">charge d’affaires </span><span class="font4">stationed at the Vatican. And what is the real significance, political or otherwise, of the visit in February of the archbishop of New York to the Vatican, has not yet been divulged by any of the actors in the transaction.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> On June 9, at Toronto, Ontario, the role of the churches of all denominations in co-operating for postwar reconstruction was discussed at the North American Institute’s conference on the organization for peace. There the clergyman from the Social Action department of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, of Washington, D.C., said: “Each church must bend its whole effort to the education of the people to construction.” It is common knowledge that the Vatican head of that clergyman claims that all the education of the people rightfully belongs under and should be under the charge and supervision of the Vatican Hierarchy, and that the public schools and other non-religious educational institutions of the nation are “godless schools” and that parishioners may not send their children to such schools except with priestly dispensation. The Hierarchy not only claims such right, but is determined to have what it claims. Its ambitions for exclusive control in the religious and educational field are seen in representations made by Roman Catholic leaders to the United States State Department that Protestant missions in predominantly Catholic Latin-American countries were a hindrance to the “good neighbor” policy and should be discontinued. In protest the Presbyterian General Assembly drew up a statement, June 1, which said: “On the principle expressed by the hierarchy, Roman Catholics ought to be suppressed in the United States, seeing it is predominantly Protestant.”—New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> 6/2/43.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” In order for global education, or world re-education, or an International Education Office to go through, it is certain that an understanding will have to be had, no, rather, a compromise will have to be made, with the Hierarchy which arrogates to itself</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">14. What pronouncement*. claims and effort* of the Roman Catholic clergy are a further indication of this?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">15. For the foregoing education program to go through, what will ha'e to be made with the Hierarchy, and what will this mean a* to fact* of history?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">the chief and dominating seat in the world educational structure. This would mean the suppression or perversion of the true facts of history concerning the religious organizations in America and elsewhere as in Axis-dominated countries at present. This is clear from the ten-year campaign carried on in America by educational leaders of the three leading religious groups. The purpose of the campaign was presumably to cut out from public-school textbooks all passages regarded as biased from the standpoint of race and religion. What is the result? It is asserted that now almost no complaints are raised concerning public-school textbooks, but there yet are complaints regarding the private- or parochial-school books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Religion’s dominance in many nations accounts for it that in proposing what it calls “six pillars of peace” the Federal Council of Protestant organizations in America offers as the sixth “pillar” this: “Establishment of the principle of the rights of peoples everywhere to intellectual and religious liberty.” The achieving of such liberty in practice among all peoples everywhere is another thing; and that is where the Federal Council admits the difficulty lies, but because of what religious system the Council did not state. It is not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1T</sup> Important to the education of the people is liberty of the press, and at the coming peace conference the news publishers of America propose to make representations for “freedom of the press of the world”. (New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> 4/20/43) A representation of educators at that peace convention is also being demanded by schoolteachers. The need of instructing and enlightening the people in order to preserve what liberty the nation yet has was forcefully stated by Thomas Jefferson, the champion of democracy. In writing to George Wythe, his teacher, friend, and co-signer of the Declaration of Independence, August 13, 1786, Mr. Jefferson said: ‘T think by far the most important bill in our whole code is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people. No other sure foundation can be devised, for the preservation of freedom and happiness. . . . Preach, my dear sir, a crusade against ignorance; establish and improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen know that the people alone can protect us against these evils, and that the tax which will be paid for the purpose [of education] is not more than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">priests,</span><span class="font4"> and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in ignorance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">IC What has the Proteatant Council in America proposed ns Its sixth 'pillar of peace’, but what difficulty does it admit as to setting it up! 17 What are publishers and educators proposing as to the peace conference ’ and bow did Thomas Jefferson state the need of instructing the people, in bis letter to George Wjtbe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’• The only education that will enable the people to defend and preserve true freedom and that will equip them for endless life and peace is from Jehovah God and by Christ Jesus. According to God's infallible Word the postwar period will not be very long, although men propose to make it a thousand years long. Democracy or any other form of national and international government will last no longer than the postwar era. Yet fear not: the New World which God establishes thereafter will have such lasting foundations that it cannot be moved, for ever. Jehovah’s new world of righteousness will be no “common people’s world”, although the common people will then enjoy their greatest blessings ever. It will not be a global democracy or a democratic world, but will be Theocratic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The education that the peoples of all nations need now and in the coming era must be concerning what is of the highest importance to them. That is Jehovah’s Theocracy, the kingdom of God exercised through his Son and King, Christ Jesus. Such education prepares and fits “men of good-will” for life in the New World; and that life will be without end. What could be more important than this? All other learning and instruction come far, far short of guiding men to that which is the desire of every righteous heart: everlasting life. Preparation in religious and other worldly institutions of learning may enable men to make a success in the unusual postwar opportunities that are expected; but of what lasting benefit will that be to them? Were the pontiff of Vatican City then to gain the whole world, of what eternal value would that be to him or his hierarchy? The unescapable battle of Armageddon will destroy that world and the hierarchy. Christ Jesus said: “For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.” (Matt. 16:26, 27) When Christ Jesus spoke of losing one’s own soul to gain the present world of religion, politics and commercial business he meant losing everlasting life in the new world that follows the fight at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Jehovah, the great Teacher, tells in his Word about “men of good-will” today living who will learn of him and act according to knowledge and who will therefore pass alive through the “battle of that great day of God Almighty’” and emerge into the cleansed earth of his new world.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">20. What does Jehovah’s Word tell concerning the life prospects of “men of good-will&quot;? and what education does he now offer, and by whom<sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font4">worldly calling or destiny could surpass the instruction and training for this blessed reward to “men of good-will”? Such education Jehovah God now offers by Christ Jesus to “whosoever will”; and those who are espoused to Christ Jesus as members of his “bride” have a part in extending it to the meek ones of earth for their good and comfort.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HISTORICAL PROGRESS OF EDUCATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Wrong instruction leads to death, and unessential teaching does not save one from that result. Right instruction, which is also vitally essential, leads to life. “For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.” “He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.” (Prov. 6: 23; 10: 17) There is a very present need of instruction in truth and righteousness. It is due to the fact that error, with its results of sin and death, has invaded the earth, and that the “father of lies”, Satan the Devil, has since deceived the whole world by religious instruction. Hence right instruction must often take the form of reproof, exposing the errors of religion. For correct and life-giving teaching the meek person must look upward to Jehovah God. “The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell [thegrave] beneath.” (Prov. 15:24) Jehovah interests himself in such as thus seek light and truth: “the meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.” (Ps. 25:9) For the meek the great Supervisor of essential education has provided ample learning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Jehovah’s textbook of instruction is his recorded Word, the sacred Bible. It is The Great Book of Freedom. It is not a man’s book; not the mental outpourings of the thirty-six or more men who wrote the Bible. It was directly inspired by the Lord God. As testified by the inspired apostle Paul: “The holy scriptures . . . are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Tim. 3: 15-17) In writing such counsel to the young man Timothy, Paul admonished him: “But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures.” Timothy’s father was a Greek, but his mother and her mother were Jewesses. (2 Tim. 3:14, 15; 1:5; Acts 16:1) This calls attention to the fact that Jewish parents and all men and</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">21 . To what do wrong end right education lead, why Is the right instruction often reproof, and to whom must the meek ones look for essential education?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">22 What is Jehovah’s textbook, why is it not a man’s book, and when did men and women of faith teach their children concerning it? </span><span class="font4">women of faith taught their children from an early age on respecting the word of God. The custom was to teach the child the Bible at least at the age of five.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The divine Record shows that before Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible the parents of faith in the Most High God taught their own children the promises and commandments of God and thereby passed along his word and the history of his dealings with humankind by oral tradition. (Gen. IS: 18,19; 28:1-5; 35:1-4; 48:1-22; 49:1-33) When Jehovah God used Moses as his mediator and entered into a covenant with the nation of Israel and made them his chosen people, he gave them the laws, statutes and ordinances of his covenant in writing. Therein the Lord God specifically provided for the education both of his covenant people and of the strangers within their gates. It was the highest and most necessary education, that of the law and the purposes and promises of God, in order that they might be safeguarded against religion and might worship and serve Jehovah alone. Not only must the tribe of Levi, its priests and Levites, act as teachers of the adults, but the parents must instruct their children from early childhood onward in the holy scriptures. This sets the rule for every parent today who has consecrated himself to God and is thereby in a covenant with the great Life-giver, that such parent must instruct his offspring in God's Word. This is a part of witnessing for Jehovah that may not be neglected or avoided with divine approval. —Ex. 12: 26, 27; 13: 8, 14. 15; Deut. 4: 9, 10; 6: 6, 7, 20-25; 11:19-21; 31:10-13; 32:46, 47; Prov. 31:1, 2, 27, 28; Lev. 10: 8-10; Ezek. 44:15, 23; Mal. 2:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Moreover, the nation of Israel must learn to read and write in order that they might read the Scriptures and might copy them for continual reference and admonition. The fulfillment of the ordinances of the law covenant also required their training in ele-mentarv arithmetic. (Deut. 6:9; 11: 20; Lev. 15: 13, 28; 25:8, 15, 16, 50; Deut. 27:1-8; Josh. 8:32-35) They must also be taught essential history. Such history, from creation onward, dealt with the origin of God’s covenants and set forth his acts against the wicked and his doings with his faithful servants and with his chosen visible organization. That an authentic and correct history might be preserved the Lord lifted the matter out of the realm of tradition and caused the inspired written account to be made and preserved in the Bible, the Holy Scriptures, and that without sparing religion.</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">25. What schools were set up in Israel, according to the records concerning Samuel, Jehoshaphat, and Elijah and Euaha? </span><span class="font4">structing the entire people of the nation were not specifically ordained. However, schools did spring up, at first for the adults who should act as instructors for others. The company of prophets which Saul met in the days of Judge Samuel is understood to have been one of such schools, presided over by Samuel. (1 Sam. 10:1-13; 19: 20-24) About two centuries later King Jehoshaphat of Jerusalem encouraged the instruction and training of all the people of the kingdom of Judah in the law and word of their God. This was a good preparation for them to face the menace of the religionists, the Moabites, Ammonites and Mount Seirites, whom Jehovah God caused to be destroyed before ever they reached the city of Jerusalem and without any fighting on the part of Jehoshaphat and his people.'( 2 Chron. 17:3-9; 20:1-30) At the same time the prophets Elijah and Elisha were active for the education of the people in the northern kingdom of ten tribes of Israel. Queen Jezebel tried to destroy the prophets associated with Elijah and Elisha and thus to suppress this educational movement for the worship of Jehovah in Israel, and many of them she did kill. The account of the times mentions ‘‘sons of the prophets’’ in connection with Elijah and Elisha. Although no such expression as ‘'school of the prophets” occurs, yet these &quot;sons of the prophets” were evidently in a school or college to fit them for their public work of popular education.—1 Ki. IS: 4; 19: 9, 10; 20: 35; 2 Ki. 2:3, 5, 7, 15; 4:1, 38.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’• After the captivity of the Jews in Babylon during the seventy years’ desolation of Jerusalem schools were established in all Jewish communities, to which the parents might send their children for instruction beyond that which they received at home. Such schools were generally maintained in the synagogues or near them. Tiie Jewish nation became the greatest nation of ancient times for the education of its people. To such an extent did schools of elementary and advanced instruction multiply that in most Jewish communities there was at least one school, and, according to some, there were in Jerusalem alone 394 schools; according to others, 460 schools. Generally a school or teacher was required for every twenty children; but where a community had forty, they might have one master teacher and an assistant. The teachers received no salary, but endeavored to maintain themselves. The pupils or their parents might make contributions to the teacher’s support. Self-support, though, was possible for teachers, because, besides his elementary education, every Jewish child must be taught a trade. This accounts for it that the apostle Paul, although highly educated, was also a tentmaker and independently</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">26 After Jerusalem’s TO-year desolation, to what extent were Jewish schools promoted, and how were the teachers maintained? </span><span class="font4">supported himself therefrom, lest he be burdensome to the Christian congregations. (Acts 18:1-3; 2 Cor. 11:7-9) He offered free education.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” Satan the Devil is against any true education of the people in the Word of God, and he saw to it that these schools were corrupted and given over to the teaching of the fables and traditions of men, especially so among the more advanced schools. It was a Jerusalem with hundreds of such schools and rabbinical colleges of learning that Jesus confronted when he went up thither. The famous school founded by the so-called “Hillel I, the Great”, flourished in her, and Gamaliel became president of it (A. D. 30-50), he being the Gamaliel at whose feet Saul of Tarsus sat and learned and advanced in the “Jews' religion” and in the traditions of the fathers, before becoming the apostle Paul. (Acts 5:34-40; 22:3; 26: 4, 5; Gal. 1:13,14) Doubtless Jesus, while growing up at Nazareth, was sent by Joseph and Mary to a local elementary school, while at the same time he learned the carpenter trade of his foster father. There is evidence to indicate that Jesus knew and spoke four languages, Hebrew, Syriac, Latin, and Greek. Jesus’ exploit at the temple of Jerusalem as a boy of twelve years shows that he was not corrupted by any teaching of traditions in the school he attended, but that he discerned and pursued the really essential education, that he might be ‘about his Father's business’.—Luke 2:39-52; Matt. 13:53-58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TEACHER’S COMMISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” What was the Father’s business for Jesus? and what is it for every follower of Jesus? For Jesus, after his special consecration to God and his baptism, it was not to engage in work of material construction and building, such as carpentering; he left such work of providing for people’s material comforts. He saw the commission unto which he had been anointed by God’s spirit at Jordan river, and he read that commission in God’s Word and owned his obligation to it. In the synagogue at Nazareth, that the Jews might know what he was about and why, he read his commission in Hebrew, thus: “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim Good News to the poor; he has sent me to announce release to the prisoners of war and recovery of sight to the blind: to send aw’ay free those whom tyranny has crushed, to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord. (Luke 4:16-21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font4"> He then showed them that he had left his carpentry work at Nazareth because his commission henceforth from God was to be a Teacher, the Greatest Educator ever on earth. As such he would be Jehovah’s witness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">27. What was Satan’s move toward such education, how was Jerusalem distinguished for Its educators, and what about Jesus' schooling’*</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">28. What was the Father’s business for Jesus the carpenter? and where and bow did Jesus plainly point this out?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” The instruction course that Jesus offered could not be obtained in the thousands of Jewish schools of the day all subject to religionists; “for [Jesus] taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.” “Never man spake like this man.” (Matt. 7:29; John 7:46) He taught concerning the new world and the Theocratic Government thereof. The theme of his instruction was, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand; repent ye, and believe the gospel.’ (Mark 1: 14,15) Although it was nineteen centuries before the establishment of the Kingdom in power in A.D. 1914, yet the instruction concerning that Theocracy was education of supreme importance to men and most honoring to God. That Government will vindicate Jehovah's name, which name all the miseducation of this perverted world has misrepresented and reproached by religious lies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Christ Jesus offered free education to humankind. Never did he pass around the collection plate to put his learners under embarrassing constraint. He associated his apostles and others with him in the teaching campaign, and to them he said: “And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.” What contributions the benefited people cared to make in the way of food and lodging and other assistance to the preaching work were to be accepted: &quot;for the workman is worthy of his meat [or hire].” —Matt. 10: 7-10; Luke 10: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> There should be no uncertainty as to what is the mission of a Christian clear on to the end of this world. After Jesus’ death and his resurrection to life in the spirit he said to his disciples: “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy [spirit]: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” (Matt. 28: 18-20) Previously, when asked as to the evidences that should mark the end of the world, he foretold to his disciples the World War, the famines, the earthquakes, the pestilences, and the persecution of his faithful followers. What did Jesus then foretell should be the pursuit that his followers should take ap after world war? What education did he emphasize exclusively as being of first importance, yes, of all-importance, to the people in the postwar period? Was it training in economics, science, religion, politics, social relations, and foreign relations, in order</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">9. What shows the education Jesus offered was not to be obtained In he Jewish schools, what was his chief subject, and why was it of ighest importance even back there?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">,0. What shows Jesus offered free education, and why do contributions ccepted not deny this ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1. How do Jesus’ words before ascending to heaven and also in his &gt;rophecy concerning the world's end remove all uncertainty a* to what 4 a Christian’s mission on earth? </span><span class="font4">to qualify the people to contribute every one something toward solving the revolutionary problems of this period? How foolish and futile that, if the final end of the world is upon humankind! Sensibly, and with unmistakable simplicity, Jesus marked out the specialized course of education of immediate value and necessity to all peoples when he said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> The Kingdom teaching must continue on to the end of the postwar period. Because it is a revolutionary time in every worldly field and because educational institutions of the nations are obliged to undergo drastic changes to meet the demands of a total world, this is no reason for any modification to be made in the primary pursuit and calling of men, women and children consecrated to Jehovah God to do his will and to serve his kingdom. Their commission remains unaffected by the revolutionary world-changes. The people’s need for salvation to life in the new world remains just the same, in fact, becomes more pressing. Instead of there being a dearth or shortage of teachers in the all-essential instruction of the Kingdom of life and peace; instead of Christians’ being enticed away from the work of giving Kingdom instruction in order to get larger financial returns by another occupation, there should be more Kingdom publishers in the field, giving the witness to all nations. Christ Jesus, the great Teacher, left us the example in his own choice of exclusive life-occupation, and he also left us his command what to do. In contrast with the closing down of many educational institutions and the discontinuance of many classes of instruction in the world, there should be more study classes in the Bible established. More companies of active ministers of the Kingdom gospel should be formed by Jehovah’s witnesses. In view of .the Kingdom’s establishment, and the imminence of the battle of Armageddon, and the glorious incoming of the new world, these war years and the postwar era should witness the expansion of education in the most vital field of human interest as never before.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> If there is need for the re-education of all peoples it is in respect of the name of Jehovah God and his Theocracy by Christ Jesus. It is now the time for the free education of “men of good-will”. This world clamors and will more loudly and insistently clamor for educational revision in other directions, which can and will be only against the Kingdom. However, not what the worldly leaders and educators demand,</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">32 . How long must the Kingdom teaching continue? and Instead of any modification of the situation to compare with the worldly educational developments, what should there be as to Bible education?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">33 . What Is the deciding factor as to that wherein the people should now be educated? and who will meet and la meeting the challenging situation?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">but what the need of the people demands and what the Most High God commands is the deciding factor. The situation constitutes a challenge. Who will meet it fearlessly, unselfishly, without compromise, and with the free education that the great Life-giver provides? The Bible answer is, Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, his “other sheep”. And in this behalf the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, in New York state, was founded and inaugurated last February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EDUCATION WITHOUT MONEY OR PRICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Jesus, in order to give the people of good-will the advantage of free education, went directly to the homes of the people and to the free open spaces, the mountains and the seaside. The Teacher went to the people and made the learning available to them without charge. He taught no worldly science, but the essentials to salvation which is by God’s kingdom and the ransom sacrifice of the Son of God. His footsteps Jehovah’s witnesses follow today. What if there are hundreds of thousands of religious and secular buildings and institutions for teaching and learning throughout “Christendom” today? Jesus went ahead with his educational program in spite of the many schools of his time, and in this attitude Jehovah's witnesses imitate him now. God has committed to them the message of the Kingdom and of life, which none of “Christendom's'' schools possess. Let her schools revise or revolutionize their curriculum and methods as far as they can stand it, they will be “ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth”. (2 Tim. 3: 7) Jehovah God has only one channel for dispensing his free education unto life eternal, and that channel is his Theocratic organization. To that organization it is written, prophetically, at Isaiah 54: 13: “And all thy children shall be disciples of the Lord [Jehovah]; and great shall be the peace of thy children.” —Leeser's translation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the great Teaching Faculty of the organization. Jesus said: &quot;It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.” (John 6:45, 47) “Christendom” by her proposed postwar reconstructive and educational program pushes Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus into a corner. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, in spite of persecution for His name’s sake, do not lose sight of the true Teachers, who guide to life. As it is written: “And though the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">34 (a) How did Jesus make his free education available tn the people’ and how must Jehovah * witnesses now follow him? (b) Why are the schools of “Christendom” inadequate’ and how is the free education for eternal life dispensed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">35 Who are the great Teaching Faculty of the organization, and bow are these not being &quot;pushed into a corner’ any more?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, [lest] ye turn to the right hand, and [lest] ye turn to the left.” (Isa. 30:20, 21) Jehovah's witnesses look to their Teachers, God and his royal Son, to interpret the Bible for them in the due time, and then hasten to discharge their duty by bringing such teaching to all those who are of good-will to Jehovah and his Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> It is true that Jehovah’s witnesses carry Biblestudy books with them and place these in the people’s hands and accept small contributions from persons of good-will desiring to aid in the work. But this does not deny that theirs is free education to “men of good-will”. A vast quantity of literature is placed upon no contribution at all. Besides that, Jehovah’s witnesses freely run recorded Bible lectures on portable phonographs and make back-calls upon goodwill persons without charge to them. They organize and conduct Bible-study classes in many homes at their own cost of time and means and at no expense to those receiving such home instruction. The educative work is not carried on for “filthy lucre”; for there is no financial profit made in it. It is done at God’s command and with a lot of hard, steady work, under persecutions. Of course, Jesus carried no books to distribute. There were no printing presses in his day to supply either Bibles or books containing his talks in print explaining God’s word and purpose. Education by him was free, though he accepted offers of meals and lodging and certain women followed him and ministered to him of their substance. —Ma11. 27: 55, 56; Luke 8:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">•’ In this connection a Scripture rule is cited (Gal. 6:6): “Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.” Instead of referring to the learner's obligation to contribute financially to the support of the instructor, this text refers to the method of instruction. According to a more emphatic translation: “Howbeit let him who is being orally instructed in the word have fellowship with him that is so instructing him, in all good things.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham) Teach</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">instruct orally</span><span class="font4"> is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">katecheo</span><span class="font4"> in Greek, from which the English word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">catechize</span><span class="font4"> is drawn. It literally means to “sound down” into the ears by oral instruction. The one thus instructed should communicate or respond orally, contributing something to the progress and profitableness of the study meeting. This is the method</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">36 . In spite of contributions accepted, why is It free education that Jehovah’s witnesses offer, and why did Jesus offer or distribute do books?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">37 How does the one being taught ‘communicate with the one teaching in all good things', and how do Jehovah's witnesses follow this rule in home Bible studies’ </span><span class="font4">which Jehovah’s witnesses use and encourage in their home Bible studies. They use no so-called ’“catechism”, but question booklets covering each paragraph of the Bible-study books. The question is orally propounded and the learner or group of learners is requested to respond, or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">communicate,</span><span class="font4"> or give oral answer to the question; after which the book paragraph and the Scripture texts cited are read aloud for the edification of all, study conductor and learners alike. Thereby all communicate in all good things, with profit to all.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Such method of education is far more effective than the straight lecture method, such as is employed in worldly colleges, and which lecture method a Commission on Liberal Education recently recommended to be discontinued as “outmoded” and abused. That is why making back-calls upon persons of good-will and conducting home Bible studies using the Watchtower study helps has been so greatly blessed and has enabled these seekers for truth and life to understand what they read in God’s Word. It is only by understanding and thus knowing the truth that “men of good-will” shall be made free with the freedom which Christ Jesus bestows.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> The great campaign of free education of men of good-will is on! It specializes on that which is essential to eternal life in the New World. Nothing can stop it until those thus educated graduate into the New World. Why not? Because the great Spirit is back of the campaign. He offers the refreshment of life-giving truth to whoever thirsts for the only education that counts. As it is written in the prophecy which applies since the establishment of God’s kingdom by his Lamb, in A.D. 1914: “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. And the Spirit [Clirist Jesus] and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22: 1.17) Besides the present-day remnant on earth of the “bride” of Christ, the Lord’s “other sheep” who have already heard and have come join in this blessed work of extending Jehovah’s invitation by his Son to come to the river of Kingdom truth. (Ps. 46:4) All persons of good-will may respond and partake of the satisfying stream freely. The only cost to them is the time and effort of studying the truths published by his visible organization engaged in the Elisha work. Blessed are those who hear the truth with hearing ears and who then discern that the real purpose of the truth is to lead them to consecrate</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3S Than tv hat other method is this more efficient, and why, therefore, have the back-call and home Eible-study work been &amp;o blessed of God’ 39. (a) On what does the frec-education campaign specialize, and why cannot it be stopped* (b) What is the cost of dunking at the river of truth, and whither or to what is the truth meant to lead them? </span><span class="font4">or devote themselves completely to the Life-giver Jehovah and his service. Such are blessed with a joyful share in the Kingdom educational campaign now before the final end comes on the world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> This educational service will continue till then. It is bound to cause a complete division among the peoples. Call to mind that when the Israelites under Joshua entered the promised land it was only bypassing between the waters of Jordan which were divided. The waters above and to the right of the priests bearing the ark were held up, whereas the waters to the left rushed down to their mergence with the sea of salt, the Dead sea. Likewise, after the prophet Elijah was taken away from Elisha his successor, Elisha crossed the Jordan by God’s special intervention. He took the mantle which had fallen from Elijah and wrapped it together and smote Jordan’s waters as Elijah had done. He called upon Jehovah, saying: “Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?” And when Elisha had done so, the waters parted hither and thither: and he went over, to further service of Jehovah God for about fifty years. —2 Ki. 2:1-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> Jordan’s waters picture earth’s peoples rapidly-descending down to destruction in the sea of death at Armageddon. The smiting of the waters, or peoples, with the prophetic mantle began after the Lord came to the temple in 1918 and judged the house of God and thereafter began judging the nations and separating the peoples thereof as “sheep” and “goats”. The water-smiting by- the Elisha class under Christ Jesus has resulted in the ‘parting of the waters’; and as the smiting with the Kingdom message continues, the dividing of the people will widen, until the separation is complete. The waters to Elisha's left, which continued their descent down to the Dead sea, picture the “goats”, who heed not the educational work of the Elisha class and their companions and who hasten on unprotected to the world-destruction at Armageddon. The waters to Elisha's right, which halted and let him pass through the river bed to carry on in his witness for Jehovah, picture the “sheep” class. These are the “men of good-will” who do not seek to destroy Jehovah’s remnant but who take advantage of their educational work and halt from the terrible descent into destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> Today the “mantle” of Theocratic truth, wrapped together in unity, becomes stronger and stronger, and the smiting power of it becomes more effective. It is our obligation to continue smiting therewith, crying out as we do so: “Where is Jehovah, the God</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

These must hasten to enter into Jehovah’s service with his remnant before the final end of this doomed world. So, on with the free education of men of good-will! The blessed day draws near when all the free and faithful shall enter into the life abundant in the New World, every tongue confessing that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of Jehovah God the Father.—Phil. 2:10, 11; Zeph. 2:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MINNEAPOLIS “FREE NATION’S” THEOCRATIC ASSEMBLY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">F</span><span class="font3">REEDOM rang loudly for three unforgettable days in Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 20 to 22. Its joyful tones of triumph sounded out as a testimony to the existence and unsuppressible activity of a free nation; and the echoes thereof continue to resound to the ends of the earth. Amid the clangor of global war it penetrated through with its good-cheer and hope, as agreeable and consoling to the ear as the sound of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sho far</span><span class="font3"> trumpets blown by Israel’s priests on the Jubilee year to &quot;proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof”. Scores of thousands, rejoicing in their newly realized freedom, clapped their hands and shouted for joy. They hailed the bold declaration of freedom, which freedom countless thousands shall yet come to know and enjoy. The occasion of this most significant demonstration of 1943 was the three-day “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of the 100 American cities in this world-wide assembly the greatest flour and lumber city of the world, Minneapolis, was the key city. From it the telephone lines which connected Minneapolis with ninety-nine other cities from the Atlantic to the Pacific and to the Gulf of Mexico spread out like an open fan south of the Canadian borderline. By such means the gatherings of these freedom-lovers enjoyed an annihilation of time and space and sat down at a common table of spiritual food with those at the central assembly. Across the borders and beyond the oceans, namely, in Mexico, Brazil, Cuba, West Africa, Sweden and Hawaii, like gatherings of Jehovah’s people were sharing in the common feast of freedom; how ? By means of copies of the principal Assembly speeches, delivered (translated, where necessary) in the local auditoriums by special appointees of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the visible sponsors of the Assembly. Many, many thousands m yet other lands were also present in spirit with the gathered hosts, as evidenced by cablegrams received at Minneapolis from distant transoceanic points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ten trunk railroad lines, four being transcontinental, besides bus and airline facilities, feed into this fair &quot;city of lakes and parks” near the headwaters of the mighty Mississippi river; and all these transportation systems brought Theocratic conventioners in their thousands, besides some private autos whose “gas rations” permitted their reaching the key city. Some few intrepid souls hitchhiked long distances. Almost all endured the hardships and inconveniences of travel due to the strained conditions of today; and a goodly number from Canada reportedly risked life and liberty to be at the glorious feast of Jehovah’s provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although Minneapolis is a city of 325 religious “churches”, many thousands of her citizens opened wide their doors for the entertainment of the visiting servants of Jehovah, despite the terrific campaign of newspaper misrepresentation and roastings directed against these faithful Christians. Many of such homes, however, yielded to religious pressure, and before the convention opened more than 1200 private residences canceled their arrangements, many turning down their, invited guests on arrival. But He who on earth had not where to lay his head provided for the lodging of all his followers, even for the faithful colored brethren, whether in homes of persons of good-will or in other quarters; and all the city hotels were filled up solid. Doubtless many of such citizens of good-will who entertained thus Jehovah’s witnesses had in mind Jesus’ words concerning the end of the world: “I was a stranger, and ye took me in.” They desired to show themselves of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sheep</span><span class="font3"> class. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">goats</span><span class="font3"> did not limit themselves to refusing to take in Christ’s “least” brethren. They complained to the municipal authorities and put the mayor and his council of 26 aidermen to great pains for holding fast to their contract obligations and defending constitutional rights and liberties belonging to all American citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The huge but magnificent $3,000,000 Municipal Auditorium, built in 1927 and of Romanesque design, proved uholly adequate for this key assembly, with but one exception, namely, the overflowing public meeting on Sunday. Its spacious arena, with balcony and gallery, seated 10,000 persons; but the Exhibition Hall in the basement beneath was used to accommodate a great part of the overflow Fronting the arena on the east end was a broad stage, 70 feet from parascenium to parascenium, and from which the Assembly speeches were delivered to the visible audience and, by the telephone cables, to the invisible audiences of all the joint assemblies, and to Station WBBR, Staten Island, N.Y. The auditorium is also equipped with a $125,000 organ, with 10,000 pipes, and having two consoles, one a concert of 5 manuals and the other a theatrical of 4 manuals. These consoles are on movable platforms which rise from beneath the arena floor. An artesian well, sunk 800 feet beneath the level of the street, brought up water at a temperature of 52 degrees and was used for the airconditioning of the great structure. The broad corridors of the various floors and the many subsidiary rooms provided locations for setting up the various departments concerned with running the convention, such as administrative offices, volunteer service, ushering, information, rooming, pioneer registration, signs, hospital, electrical and refrigeration, parking, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A cafeteria was installed in the basement Exhibition Hall, where, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., except during the meetings, complete kitchen and cafeteria equipment fed an estimated 1,000 conventioners an hour with wholesome food and tasty dishes. The hungry approached the counters in eleven lines </span><span class="font2">in orderly fashion. Jehovah God by his organization provided sufficient “ration points” to care for the physical needs of all, with a surplus left over at the close of the Assembly, as when Christ Jesus fed the five thousand from five loaves and two fishes. The book supply and territory departments occupied the eastern section of this Exhibition Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All help, to service these many departments, was voluntary and non-remunerative; and thousands of consecrated men, women and children willingly offered themselves in answer to the service call and worked long, steady and intensely active hours to minister to their brethren. The entire working setup was an admirable demonstration of thorough organization, fine foresight, efficient performance, zeal for God’s cause, love of men of good-will, good order without friction, and brotherly unity and co-operation under Christ. Worldly observers marveled thereat. Jehovah was honored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OPENING DAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Friday, August 20, dawned with ideal weather conditions for the great gathering. At an early hour the initial organization at the Auditorium was already functioning, as thousands began coming in for the bounteous “feast of fat things”. Promptly, at S : 30 a.m., the convention chairman opened the morning’s “assembly for Theocratic activities&quot;, at which an estimated 5,000 attended. After song, prayer, a brief consideration of the day’s Bible text, and then field-service instructions, the Kingdom publishers obtained their territory assignments and literature and issued forth onto Minneapolis’ broad and clean streets. In the morning they carried the message from house to house, and in the early afternoon did street work, distributing handbill-advertisements of the public meeting, offering the Society's magazines on the corners and curbs, and doing information walking with announcement placards attached to their persons. This was in addition to the signs on streetcars and buses, already displayed since August 9, and signs placed in store windows, besides signs carried on the bumpers of automobiles and sprayed in white on the sides thereof. “Freedom in the New World” they all unanimously announced; and the so-called “Four Freedoms” propaganda of the worldly politicians received a great setback. Due to the transportation difficulties the convention witnessing was restricted to the areas of the “Twin Cities”, Minneapolis and its neighbor on the other side of the river, St. Paul, together comprising a metropolitan population of over 911,000 Minnesotans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the appointed time these publicity agents of God’s Theocratic Government reassembled at the Auditorium for a quarterhour of sacred songs, to the accompaniment of the great organ played by competent consecrated hands. At 2: 45 p m. prayer and a heart-warming address of welcome were delivered by the convention chairman. Then, as the voices of 9,000 swelled in singing to Jehovah the song “Eternal God, Celestial King”, the nationwide telephonic system tied itself together into a network binding the joint assemblies to the key one The unseen audience heard part of the song. At a few seconds after 3 p.m an assistant chairman introduced the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, N. H. Knorr. As he took bis position before a battery of microphones to deliver the keynote speech of the Assembly the audience greeted him with glad applause. Adorning the stage on which he spoke were graceful palms and baskets of gorgeous gladioli, reflecting Jehovah’s power and glory. The speaker stood against a background of a blue plush curtain. Against this, and above his head, there was spread a 40-foot banner, from which dangled a broad white fringe. Upon the banner’s base-material of rich violet plush there scintillated with spangles of white and gold the dynamic words of the great Master, “The Truth Shall Make You Free,” with its citation, John 3: 32, beneath. This text was in perfect keeping with the president’s subject, “Standing Fast for Freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This keynote speech found its basis in that masterful enunciation of the principles of Christian freedom contained in the apostle’s letter to the Galatians, and particularly Galatians 5:1, reading: “For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.” (A.2J.7.) Rapt attention was paid to the speaker, and repeated applause broke as he advanced with his speech. He exposed religion as being the “yoke of bondage” and described how “Christendom”, like Jerusalem and her children of old, had been brought into bondage thereby. Jehovah’s witnesses have been delivered from this yoke, but must ever be on guard lest they relapse and give m to organized religion’s relentless fight and encroachments against the truth and its witnesses. A solemn warning was sounded that the fight to maintain this freedom to worship and serve Jehovah God and his kingdom must continue more energetically than ever in the postwar era. The offensive against religion must be pressed unabatedly. The Scripture illustration emphasizing this need held the audience spellbound as the speaker briefly described the visit of Israel's king to the bedfast prophet Elisha. When the speaker, repeating Elisha’s command to the king with bent bow and its arrow against the string, cried, “Shoot!” the effect was electric and many were startled as if shot. “The arrow of Jehovah’s deliverance!” rang out, as with overtones of victory and freedom. Beyond what the king back there did, Jehovah’s witnesses, with the bundled arrows of Theocratic truth, must smite the earthly visible organization of Satan continuously. The ones who keep up the shooting and smiting ■will be those who will aid others to freedom and will themselves be able to stand fast for this cherished possession. With Scriptural positiveness the speaker ended, saying: “With clean hands, only those who have maintained their stand for God-given, Christian freedom shall go into eternal life and liberty in the New World.” (The president’s speech in full was published in the September 1 issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> to which we here refer all our readers.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the applause died down the chairman introduced the vicepresident of the Watchtower Society, who is also its legal attorney, and a veteran of many battles in the courts of many states, including the United States Supreme Court, for the Christian and constitutional rights and immunities of Jehovah’s witnesses. He now filled in the remainder of the network hour, appropriately using the subject “Freedom of Worship”. Already raised to heights of enthusiasm by the president’s speech, the audience applauded greatly when the speaker said: “Although worldly governments must recognize this right, they can no more grant to Jehovah’s witnesses the liberty to worship God than they can give to God the liberty of receiving such worship. The immortal freedom to preach as ministers of Almighty God soars high above the reach of earthly powers, or decrees. Today, in all the earth, there is but one people who enjoy freedom of worship. It cannot be taken from them Who are these people! </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then swiftly he reviewed their fight, particularly from 1933 on, to hold the line against the aggressions of the totalitarians against this Christian right, both in continental Europe and especially in the United States. It was a glorious account of battles and of victories from Jehovah’s hands to his faithful witnesses. Notice was served on the enemy that there will be no surrender or retreat from our rightful positions. To aid and prepare the battlers to keep up their fighting in the courts with yet greater effectiveness the Society has gotten out a timely booklet entitled “Freedom of Worship”. When the vice-president reached the climax of his talk by announcing this booklet and its immediate release, there was another outburst of joy and appreciation. The ushers were kept busy for some time in supplying copies to the many applicants therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The assembly convened again at 7 p.m. for songs. Some messages received by wire from far points were read, including a cablegram from Cape Town, South Africa. Another from the Dark Continent reported 3,000 assembled at five points m West Africa. The telegrams which got through from other joint assemblies increased the rejoicing of the key-city conventioners with their reports of attendances, and of their reception of the three o’clock program and of their appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At 7:15 p.m. the evening addresses began, of a half-hour each. The first speaker was a representative of the Society who was being called m to take up a course of study at the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead. The two speakers that followed him were both members of the first graduating class of this Bible College; which announced fact evoked applause from the audience. The training these young men received at this institution of Christian learning was noteworthy from the preparation of their speeches and the manner of delivery thereof. All three presentations were based on articles of this past year in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> The convention turned out in as great numbers for these as in the afternoon. Such sustained attendance, together with earnest attention and loud expressions of appreciation, denoted several things, namely, the brethren’s keen expectancy of further good things, their desire to hear the full counsel of God, and that Jehovah’s witnesses are not following a human leader nor interested in only his utterances, but are attending upon God’s message through his visible organization under His appointed Leader for it, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NATIONAL EDCCATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The early pioneers who founded and built up Minneapolis were interested m education besides general upliftment m material things, one of then first moves being to found what has become the University of Minnesota Minneapolis now has well over a hundred public-school buildings; yet never had she entertained such an educational assembly as gathered at the Auditorium these three memorable days. This assembly represented educational interests of crowning impoitance and of eternal value to the people of that city and state and the nation and of all nations of the earth. The developments of the second day, Saturday, August 21, forcefully established this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The day dawned clear and mild, and those skies which gave to the state its Indian name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Minnesota,</span><span class="font2"> meaning </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sky-tinted waters, </span><span class="font2">smiled benignly upon the Assembly. Multitudes of new arrivals continued to pour in and converge upon the Auditorium, and the attendance swelled to around 12.000. So the field-service participation increased. Sueh publicity work during the morning and early afternoon at the homes of the people and on the public thorough-faies of the “Twin Cities&quot; gave zest and whetted up the appetite for the spiritual table that Jehovah God was to spread in the afternoon and evening for his devoted people in the very midst of their enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At 2: 30 p m. there was a rousing song, and then experiences were related The assembly was specially delighted to have graduates of the College of Gilead, both young men and women, speak to them bnefiy and tell of their experiences both during the college term and since their graduation last June; and each and all received quite a round of applause. Once more the benefit of their training at Gilead shone forth in the comportment and expression of these graduates; and many pioneers in the audience were stirred with strong desire to prove worthy someday to be called in for a course at Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At 3 p m. the eireuit of the vast telephonic network again closed, with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font2"> assemblies of the American cities wired together. It was the greatest such network, not only in the history of Jehovah’s witnesses, but also, as far as we know, in the history of telephony. The circuit, furthermore, was this time closed for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font2"> hours, and that </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font2"> spite of global war. The provision and availability of this vast intercommunication system for so long and under such conditions was plainly of Almighty God. It was doubtless his time for an outstanding event in the progress of His educational campaign, earned on since the coming of his Messenger, Christ Jesus, to the temple in 1918. The Municipal Auditorium was now full and its Exhibition Hall was required to take care of the excess. The song “Arise and Shine” died away, and then a symposium of four speakers began, all being directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first speech, of forty minutes, on the theme “The Free Nation Keeping Truth”, was based upon Isaiah’s prophecy, chapter 26. It plainly identified this only “free” nation, showed what truth it kept and how so, and held up to view the freedom which this favored nation alone enjoys now among all nations on the earth. (See a succeeding issue of this magazine for the full text of this speech.) The next address had as its theme “The Service Must Go On”. Said the speaker: “We are God’s free men.” However, he went on to explain that all such free creatures were under Kingdom requirements of service to God. and not one is exempt therefrom. Various devices of the enemy are applied to deprive these of their freedom, but, notwithstanding all such enemy encroachments and opposition, the service to Jehovah God and his kingdom must continue. And it will, no matter what is brought to bear against his witnesses, and “even though death be the toll”.—Job 27:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The chairman then introduced the Society’s oldest director, W. E. Van Amburgh, who has been its secretary-treasurer for the past forty veal's. The appearance of this tall veteran of service, feeble with 80 years of age, was highly appreciated by the assembly. His hands shook greatly with palsy as he held the paper he read on “Progress in Face of Opposition”; but his opening words came through distinctly: “The Theociatie Government of Jehovah is the principal theme of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation.” Briefly he described the progress of God's organized people despite opposition, particularly from 1S94 onward, and showed the extent of the witness work todav. so that even the high courts of the land have been obl-gcd to iccognize the righteousness of the work of Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Proving that even the newspaper and radio woild have been constrained to publish that Jehovah God has witnesses in the earth, the speaker read excerpts of a June 29 newspaper account of the underground witness work which makes progress in Nazi Germany and which all dastardly attempts of the Hitlerites have failed to stamp out. After making gratified mention of Watchtower Bible College and its import, he closed, saying “Thus God’s ‘faithful and wise servant’, the Society under Jesus, goes victoriously on, under his leadership, to new triumphs, and to the final complete overthrow of Satan and all his wicked hosts, in complete vindication of Jehovah's name. His kingdom under Christ has been set up. Let all the remnant and their companions shout ‘Alleluia!’” And with all his vocal strength he did shout this final word of praise to Jehovah, fairly leaping otf his feet and thrusting his right hand triumphantly into the air. The response of the audience was instantaneous and loud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outstanding feature of the two-hour program then followed, at 4 p.m., this being the president’s speech on “Fice Education for ‘Men of Good-Will'”. Because of its value and impoitance to all freedom-lovers his speech in full is published as the leader in this magazine issue. The vim, earnestness and conviction with which the president spoke added great power to what he said, and drew round after round of applause, from early in the speech on, for more than a score of times He concluded with a reference to Elisha’s smitmg the Jordan waters with the prophetic mantle and crying, “Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah t” and then made the modern-day application, shouting: “So, on with the free education of men of good-will! The blessed day draws near when all the free and faithful shall enter into the life abundant in the New World, every tongue confessing that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of Jehovah God the Father.” By now all listeners were lifted to a high pitch of expectancy, and what followed will survive in memory into the New World. “May I now offer for adoption this Declaration!” the president said, and then read, in a crescendo of declamation, the following declaration</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">JEHOVAH’S witnesses and their companions, being gathered together world-wide in the “Free Nation's Theocratic Assembly”, do hereby declare:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That Jehovah God by his truth and by the sacrifice of his beloved Son Christ Jesus has made us free; and that, though in the world, we are not of it, but are of His new world to come;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That our freedom is not granted for any selfish or lawless purpose, but is that we may fully serve Him and the earthly interests of his kingdom under Christ Jesus;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That our commission from God ordains us to be his witnesses and ministers of the gospel of his Kingdom; and we must perform our part as such in the educational work which he has decreed must be carried on at the end of the world, where we are now;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That all “men of good-will”, without distinction as to race, creed or color, must be located and prepared for life in the new world; and that the educational work with the Kingdom truth is the most essential instruction to such ones now and in the postwar period, as it makes them ready for life eternal;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That our work is not subversive of present governments, nor for commercial gam or any selfish purpose or in the interest of any religious sect; but is for the purpose of spreading good-will among men, and promoting full respect for law, order and righteousness, upon which the permanent freedoms and peace and prosperity of the New World will rest;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the textbook of freedom is Jehovah God’s Word, the Bible, and that the truths he has revealed therein by his Son and King at the temple make the people free, without which all freedoms announced by men are passing and illusory;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That in obedience to our commission we will endeavor now and in the postwar era to extend more widely the publication of Kingdom truth and to increase the number of free Bible-study classes in the homes of “men of good-will” throughout the earth, using the educational means which the Lord has provided for our use. We are in favor of free education of all “men of good-will” concerning The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hardly had he finished his ringing closing sentence, when, amid the crash of applause, a director leaped to the microphone and moved the adoption of the Declaration. The vice-president seconded the motion Said the president: “You have heard the motion for adoption, and its second. All who are in favor say Aye'” A mighty “Aye” of unanimity arose on the instant, and the din of further applause followed. Again the president spoke: “By Jehovah’s grace, it is now my privilege to present one of the latest educational means He has provided through his organization for our use, the new book entitled—” The name of the book was drowned out by the clapping of thousands of hands, and, without warning, all the lights in the mam auditorium flashed out, hiding from view the beautiful violet-covered book, with gold-stamped title, held in the upraised hand of the president. Dismay or wonderment swept throughout the vast assembly at the momentary darkness; and then all eyes opened wide in amazement as the beams from two spotlights in the balcony flashed and played fully upon the violet sign over the president’s head, causing to gleam forth the golden-lettered words, “The Truth Shall Make You Free.” Comprehension broke in the minds of all beholders: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">There</span><span class="font2"> was the title of the new book! Whereat a shout went up such as never before struck the ear since the ancient days of Jehovah’s victories won for his chosen people. All auditorium lights came on again, and the president went ahead: “To everyone at this Assembly from five years old upward who will accept it in the spirit of this Declaration a copy of this book will be given free!” This last word set off another shout of exultation, of equal caliber with the previous one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Here was something new indeed, so harmonious in spirit with the president’s theme, “Free Education for ‘Men of Good-wiil’.” In 1941 the Society bestowed upon the 15,000 children of 5 to IS years of age at the St. Louis Theocratic Assembly a gift copy of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font2"> But never before did it offer to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">everybody </span><span class="font2">above five years in attendance at its general assembly a free copy of a new clothbound publication. This meant a free copy not only to the more than nine thousand who accepted such at Minneapolis, but also to the more than a hundred thousand attenders at all the other assemblies in the nation-wide telephone network who heard the president’s announcement. Before the chairman could finish announcing that the new book would be distributed to all these as they </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">left</span><span class="font2"> the Auditorium building, thousands bad arisen from their seats and were on a grand but orderly march to the exits. Then 750 ushers sprang into action to properly direct the streams of men, women and children. The corridors and six great series of ramps of the building -resounded with the tramp and voices of joyous, eager thousands. In ten minutes the main auditorium was cleared, and m twenty minutes everyone had passed the outside exits and had his treasured copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Hake Ton Free’’.</span><span class="font2"> What an examination and a glancing through the book by joyous possessors there was! The book exceeded any expectations!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was a happy host that reinvaded the Auditorium building for the evening sessions. Song, experiences by special pioneer publishers and college graduates, and messages from London, England, and Newfoundland and elsewhere, were enjoyed by a paeked-out auditorium. Thereafter the speeches were delivered, on “Unity and Its Gains”, by the vice-president; on “Progress of Theocratic Ministry Training”, by the servant of Kingdom Farm, where the Watchtower Bible College is located in the building Gilead, and on “To Whom Does the Textbook Belong!” by the president’s secretary. Then Brother Knorr himself put in appearance and called attention to the study-questions booklet described in the appendix of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;.</span><span class="font2"> Another surprise was sprung when he announced this new booklet’s completion and its immediate release there. It was good news indeed when he advised that the campaign with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make</span><span class="font2"> You </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Free&quot; </span><span class="font2">was to begin m October. Such was the anticlimax of a day of overwhelming blessings. With unutterable gratitude to the great Giver of every good and perfect gift his favored people retired for the night’s rest before the final day of Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GRAND FINALE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The widely-heralded day of Sunday, August 22, lighted upon Minneapolis with continuing gracious weather. The day’s events began with an early gathering, at 8 a m., where, after a discourse on “Baptism”, 237 expressed their desire and qualification to be immersed in water m symbol of their wholehearted consecration to do God’s will. These were conveyed to Lake Calhoun for sucli baptism. Meantime the service assembly at the Auditorium nas concluded and the active publishers went afield in the educational campaign, extending the final invitations to the public lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By 2 p.m. the main auditorium was already jammed full, at which time a Watchtower director stirred everyone with the exhortation on “Elders Feed the Flock”. The effect thereof upon the conventioners was cumulative. It gave fresh emphasis to the vital truth that Chnst has made his followers free to serve Jehovah, and that his apostles and all the faithful never permitted Satan’s organization and its business and commercial element to so crowd in upon their affairs as to absorb all their time and leaic no time for them to preach the Gospel. The obligation rests upon all consecrated ones who, by knowledge, experience and growth, have come to maturity or eldership to feed the flock, and particularly now the Lord’s “other sheep” who have been scattered by religion. The all-out, total effort of the enemy organization today in its global war will not be permitted by the faithful to take them over body and soul and to so engross their time, attention and strength as to make them fail of doing their part in ‘feeding the flock’. This speech caused great searchings of heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A short intermission remained until the great public event, and during this time the grand Auditorium organ provided a fine program of music. All available space in the great municipal structure was now crowded out. The city fire department men would allow no more in, and thousands collected outside to listen to the loud-speakers strategically placed. Down one street, as far as the eye could see, for at least two blocks, there were private cars and listeners inside or congregated outside; and this crowd augmented as the program went on. Upward of seventeen thousand were thus gathered to hear the advertised speech “Freedom in the New World”. The whole scene was a slap in the face of the local newspapers which had scorned the lofty educational purpose of the Theocratic Assembly and which had stooped to a lot of evil surmisings, inflammatory insinuations, and deprecatory statements under blaring headlines. The enormous turnout, which included many thousands of the public of the “Twin Cities”, was convincing proof that Jehovah’s people need not depend upon the commercial and religion-bound press to advertise their events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now there was a congregational song, during which the great web of the telephone system clicked in and gathered together all the widely-spread joint assemblies to the spiritual table at Minneapolis. All heard the chairman’s brief introduction of the public speaker, the Watchtower president, who received quite an ovation. The very first words of the speech, spoken in measured tones, gripped all audiences: “The free world comes only from the hand of Almighty God. It is at the door, and no power in heaven or in earth can turn back the hand of the all-powerful Creator from building it and offering it in all its glory to worthy creatures.” For fifteen minutes the audience (including the radio listeners of WBBR) maintained a silent close attention as the speaker declared that the free world would be that of the sons of God, and showed how humankind had lost its freedom and that now the propaganda goes forth for a free world by man's creation. Then the audience could no more restrain itself, and applauding began. It kept on recurring with increasing frequency as the speech went forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The speaker uncovered the leason for the present-time propaganda for a new and finer world. He pointed back to “Christendom’s” ancient prototype, unfaithful Jerusalem, whose course foreshadowed how the coming postwar man-made order would play with men’s freedom and deceive them and then the superhuman demons would bring all humankind into a condition the very opposite of a free world. Religion and her political and commercial allies would fail, and vould fall out with one another. Finally Jehovah God would assign them all to a ‘liberty unto the famine, pestilence and sword’ because of their fighting against God and his new world. “None of such opposers of the Theocratic New World will survive”; and the audience agreed with applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then the speaker held forth Jehovah’s dependable promise, recorded in His Word, of a new world. It was most delightful to hear his progressive description of the Theocratic Got eminent of that free world; the visible earthly representatives theieof; the freedoms that it will bring and permanently insure to men, freedoms that men of this old world could not even dare to offer; finally, the destruction of death and the grave and even of the prince of demons, Satan the Devil. All this shall culminate in the everlasting vindication of Jehovah’s name and in the choice of Him as their God by all the faithful people that live in true and lasting freedom. The speaker then assured his audience with these final words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The foregoing is no imaginary Utopia dreamed by some religious ‘saint’ [evidently the ‘sainted’ Catholic, Sir Thomas More], but is God’s written Word sworn to over His own name and is true. Accept and believe his Word now and let it henceforth be your life-guide and hope and comfort. If you do so, it means for you the gaining of the heritage of life everlasting and freedom </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE NEW WORLD.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The speech had ended, and the chairman announced its release m printed form, and that each might have a free personal copy and several more copies for friends of good-will. Thus this new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font2"> enjoyed a tremendous circulation at its very birth, as the thousands at Minneapolis and all other Assembly points gratefully accepted copies in token of this expanding campaign of “free education for men of good-will”. Such distribution greatly added to the total of literature distributed by the conventloners in the field activities the past three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many were now obliged to leave the key city for their home territories, and yet the Auditorium’s main hall was packed for the concluding features of the evening. A half-hour of experiences proved to be still palatable to the feasters. Next the convention servant, whose activities are largely in the background, delivered a discourse on “No More Time for the Old Course”. At the close of these three days of the grandest Assembly yet the brethien sincerely felt that way and were more than ever resolved to apply themselves to the righteous course that ushers one into the free new world. Another speech followed on “Faithful and Wise Servant”. The speaker, one of the College graduates, discussed the place held by God’s anointed servant-class under Christ, and by its legal servant, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, in doing God’s present work on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The convcntioners were much gratified to have Brother Knorr make a final appearance on the stage to give, as announced on the program, “a message from the president.” This proved to be a half-hour having all the warmth and good-cheer of a big family that love God and one another, assembled together in peace m a cozy home at close of day and reviewing things dear to their hearts. The president read numerous telegrams lately received from other Assembly points and foreign lands, and then finished off with an impromptu talk. He stressed the added responsibility of God’s consecrated people now due to increased knowledge and new instruments for his service. There was set forth as our valid hope the glorious vista of further work, with enlarged opportunities, in the time yet remaining before the battle of Armageddon. Courageous words were also spoken of determination to carry on in the face of persecution and of opposition to this educational campaign down to the God-appointed close of the work. Then, with prayer of praise and thanksgiving and for continued blessings, the president dismissed the Assembly. The great trek homeward by Jehovah’s refreshed hosts took place now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To Jehovah Most High and to Christ Jesus his Son are due, and are rendered, all credit and praise for the success and blessings of this “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly.</span></p>
