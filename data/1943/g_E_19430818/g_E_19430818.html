<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Back to Religion in Chicago</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ The </span><span class="font8">London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic. Times</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> has an </span><span class="font8">imposing story with a triple headline reading, “Protestants Launch Back-to-Religion Movement in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S.A.” That </span><span class="font8">ought to be good in the city of Al Capone and Robert McCormick. It is now a little more than eight years since Chicago made its last grand Protestant rush toward religion. That was good, in the time of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible plainly teaches the existence of a personal Devil. If you desire you may look up some of the evidence. See Job 1:6-12; 2:1-6; Isaiah 14:12-14; Ezekiel 28:11-19; Matthew 12: 24-27; Luke 8:4-15; John 8: 44; 14: 30; 12: 31; 16:11; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Ephesians 2:2; 1 John 3: 8. There are many others, which you can find with the help of a concordance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, neither these scriptures nor any other have any weight with clergymen, and so, when they had this last previous religious spasm in Chicago and a questionnaire was sent out to all the Protestant ministers of the city, 24 percent of all the Baptist clergymen replied that they did not believe in a Devil; so, also, 45 percent of the Episcopalians, 44 percent of all the Congregationalists, 59 percent of the Presbyterians, 70 percent of the Methodists, and 100 percent of the Lutherans. If these dominies were strong for religion (religion is the teaching of anything that contradicts the Bible), then they ought to be miles ahead of their 1934 stand by now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Probably, by this time, there isn’t a minister in the city that would admit that he believes in a Devil. And many of them, if they were cornered, would be forced to admit that they do not believe in one word of the Bible, nor in the God of the Bible, and that they are in the religious business because it is a soft way to get a living and stand well in the community without doing any work.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark29"></a>CONSOLATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">“And in His name shall the nations hope.”—Matthew 12:21, A.R.V. r</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Volume XXIV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.

<p><span class="font10">“All Roads Lead to Rome”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font8">HOEVER got up the saying, “All roads lead to Rome,” was a good observer and hit it right. The frequent fairy tales that the pope is about to jump to Brazil or some other place are pure invention. He never had such an idea in his life, nor will he. The newspapers must have something to fill their columns and it pays them to invent tales and then deny them. And this suits the Hierarchy perfectly. They get in the papers-twice, instead of sitting in quiet on a back seat. Publicity and power in this life is the only reward any of them will ever get, and they want the publicity and the power right away, now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lord Robert Montague, at one time a Catholic, made this sweeping statement of the Vatican as a center of information : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Curia is a Cabinet of long standing and knowledge of affairs. It never “goes out” by the action of an adverse majority in a representative Chamber. All have been carefully trained for their work; while from reports derived from priestly confessors all over the world, the best and most detailed knowledge . of the characters and intentions of statesmen, and of the people, are ready to their hand. The Vatican is the center of all the information of the world; and every Bishop has periodically to visit Rome in order that his inmost soul may be probed, and his continual reports may be tested. Such is the Cabinet with which the Protestant statesmen hope on equal terms to cope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Referring to this same thing the psalmist said, “They search out iniqui-' ties; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 18, 19+3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">them, and the heart, is deep.”—Psalm 64:6.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Art of Concealing Information</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Not only is the Vatican the center of the “wisdom of this world”, which the apostle, in 1 Corinthians 3:19, describes as “foolishness” because it seeks to circumvent the purposes of Almighty God, but it has a skill, born of centuries of experience, of hiding the truth, and making light to appear to be darkness, and darkness to be light. Thus, with radios blaring in every country, and with the truth widely published that Hitler and Pacelli have steadily worked together, and are still doing the same thing, it is a great achievement to hornswoggle the United States into thinking that the pope is against Nazism. He is nothing of the kind. He has never said anything . against it, and never will, despite lying misrepresentations by reporters and editors who are told what they must say. Once in a while the truth gets out, as in this statement by The Associated Press, published in the Washington </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">Vatican stand against Nazism, continental observers said, would have reverberations among Catholies from Lisbon to the fighting front in Russia. On that front Itai-ians, as well as Catholic soldiers recruited from the Balkans, Spain, France and other Axis-dominated countries, are motivated partially by the belief they are engaged in a Christian crusade. Condemnation of National Socialism also would have a telling effect within Germany, where a population faces another war winter, and in Italy, where the press has hammered home the notion that the fight on the Eastern front is against the Bolshevist foe, which to the average Italian means the foe of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To the full extent of its ability the Vatican has spread far and wide the idea that it alone stands between the yvorld and Bolshevism. It was an idea to sell; it was business; so it was sold. When World War I was fought there were only 16 nations with representatives at the Vatican, but the Bolshevism scare was sold so skillfully that ,the number is now 40, if Myron Taylor is included in the number.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Myron</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the Right Man</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Though nominally a Protestant, Myron Taylor is one of the most religious of men, and has the utmost reverence for the pope and everything of which the pope is the center. His gift of $500,000 to the pope was made four months before he started on one of his trips to Vatican City. It takes a few months for a gift of $500,000 to soak in. Myron is no fool. He knew how to manage the Steel Trust, and to come away, while still a relatively young man, with money by the hogshead: something around $20,000,000, which is _ “quite some coin”. There has been talk ’ of making Myron a full-fledged ambassador, but it has not gotten that far yet. To date he is still President Roosevelt’s personal representative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In an address to a Catholic club in New York Myron said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In those wide and unhappy lands where tragedy and death are present there remain but few reservoirs of peace. Among them there is one toward which the eyes of all are turned with reverence and confidence and hope, the majestic figure of the Holy Father in the Vatican. In him we can well have a supreme confidence founded solidly not only on his holy office but also on his embracing spirituality, his vision and his very great talent. Within the historic walls of the Vatican one finds as in no other place among the war-torn nations an atmosphere of tranquillity, of thoughtful analysis, of deliberate judgment, and of courageous and unchanging resolve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reading that too hastily one might get the impression th'at Myron was talking about the Holy Father in heaven; but he seems not to have thought of that. In. his address to the (Catholic) Carroll Club, Myron went on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The supreme duty of all of us is to exert ourselves to the utmost to thrust from the world the irresponsibility of hate and revenge, and in its place to put the responsibility of good-will, so that the people of the world may cease to tear down what through the centuries they have built, and may start building for the centuries to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That’s a nice idea, about doing away with all this practice of hate and revenge. One wonders if among Mr. Taylor’s audience was that amiable gentleman, the “Reverend Father” Harney, of New York, who explained to a New Brunswick, N. J., audience that the Catholic Church would cheerfully murder every “heretic” if it had the power. That would include Myron himself, money and all.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Pope “Blessed” the World</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">On one of the recent occasions when .the pope “blessed” the world it took the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Times</span><span class="font8"> more than two columns to tell about it. In the story occurred this expression: “Many of our fellow men need the succor of the Father of Christendom, succor which not infrequently he alone can give.” A little more than seven months later, when his “blessing” had either been forgotten or had had time to sink in, the pope broadcast the solemn fact that the world had been plunged into darkness by fatal errors. He told the truth that time. The errors center about the place where he does business, and where most of them originated during the Dark Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In an address at New Orleans, the “Reverend Father” John McMahonf of Our Lady of the Lake College (371 students in this “college”), said that the only way that peace will ever be obtained is</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">by an international police force. Pre-, sumably that police force, in his foreview, would be under the control of the Vatican. That is not God’s purpose. Peace will come by direct action of the Prince of Peace, and “of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end&quot;,—Isaiah 9:7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Backing up Mr. McMahon, but not backing up the Scriptures, the Hierarchy in the. United States said officially that “the spirit of Christianity can write a real and lasting peace in justice and charity to all nations, even to those not Christian”. But the facts are that after doing their best for fifteen centuries, the world is now in worse condition than it was when they first tried to get the Boman Empire to mend its ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Have one more speech on this subject. This time it is from the lips of Robert O’Brien, of the Jersey City tax department. Please read it privately, so as not to gag in public: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">American Catholics must see that Great Britain does not dominate the peace table at the end of the present World War. . . . America must dominate the peace conference with the pope, vicar of Christ on earth, sitting in to see that justice is meted out. . . . The present war was brought about by the very people for whom we are fighting this war: the present war is directly traceable to the peace conference table of the last war, when Christ was told there was no room for him. The Vicar of Christ- wanted to be represented ' at the peace table then and Catholics must see that he is represented when this war is over. </span><span class="font8">(In view of the fact that Catholics constitute but 15 percent of the population, this gentleman needs nothing for his nerves.)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Inconsistency Gone to Seed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">It is well known that the Roman Cath. olie Hierarchy is a strictly Italian racket. Other bishops and archbishops are taken in, and some of them are made cardinals, but never enough to overthrow the Italian control, which has persisted for generations. As a matter of policy, not of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 18, 1943 </span><span class="font8">principle, the Hierarchy instructs its bishops to profess great loyalty to their particular government where they chance to be located, but always with an eye to political favors at the expense of the common people. If any government, as, formerly, the Spanish Republic, tries to be honest and just and give the people a fair deal, the Hierarchy is its worst enemy.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>A Beautiful Crawfish</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">A writer' of Catholic sympathies in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John A. Lee’s Weekly,</span><span class="font8"> New Zealand, admits perforce that the Italian bishops and archbishops were squarely behind Mussolini in the Ethiopian war, and because they were Italians and had the same murder rights as other Italians. But when he came to discuss the pope, who was also an Italian bishop at that very time, and actually is yet, he made this beautiful crawfish:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He, and he alone, ean reasonably be expected to be above all national loyalties, and to speak, if he speaks at all on a national issue, for the Church throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In an address in New York city the “Reverend Father” James J. Navagh wonders what would have happened if a generation ago some priests had gotten hold of little Benito Mussolini and little Adolf Hitler and taught them the Catholic idea. That’s just the trouble. They </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font8"> taught the unscrupulous, selfish, lying, abominable doctrines of the Hierarchy, and today are doing their best to make the whole world bow once more to the wicked system of Oppression, lies, cruelty, hypocrisy and meanness with which both are still connected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pope was oh so glad to turn the Italian church bells over to Mussolini, so that they could be made into the cannons, trucks and other things which sons Adolf and Benito need in everincreasing quantities. This news came from Rome via the International News Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">H. G. Wells, famous British writer, wants something done about the pope’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">petting of the Fascist powers. In the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Dispatch</span><span class="font8"> he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The present pope is in open alliance with the Japanese. He is a declared enemy of our ally, Russia. There is a Japanese mission at the Vatican operating actively as an intelli* gence center, . . . The Vatican is plainly Resolved to turn this present conflict into </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">religious war against Russia. . . . Why not a 2,000-pound bomb in the Vatican garden as a warning now? Why not a score of them upon the Vatican, Quirinal and Palazzo Chigi, and then if liberal elements don’t wake up to their responsibilities and send the pope and his Japanese allies skedaddling across the Alps, why should the Allied nations refrain </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">froth </span><span class="font6">a 1,000-plane raid upon the Eternal City? There would be no real vandalism in that. The charm of Rome has always been its ruins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Seattle </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Masonic Tribune</span><span class="font8"> takes notice of the fact that the pope put up a holler to President Roosevelt to prevent the bombing of the Vatican, and that the pope did not put up any holler to Hitler not to bomb Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, neither of which places has been spared by the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A statement in the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font8">says that “inhabitants of Rome say frankly that their greatest air raid insurance is the pope”. Commenting on this the Jesuit magazine </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font8"> says: “How true in the wider sense that js! The Papacy, and what it stands for, can be the only insurance against recurrent war. But that can come about only if the pope be given his rightful place at any table round which the peace terms will be, in God’s own time, discussed.” In other words, the Jesuits will not hesitate to incite wars eternally in every corner of the world unless they are given the privilege they crave, of dominating the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No &quot;Vatican-Axis Break Expected&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bridgeport (Conn.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Herald</span><span class="font8"> carried the above headline but left out the most important word. That is the little word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">No,</span><span class="font8"> of two letters, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font8">precedes the quotes. Reading the story over carefully, it merely recites that certain Italian newspapers objected to the visit of Myron Taylor to the pope. As far as the relations between the pope </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">Benito and Adolf go, that means nothing, not a thing in the world. The man </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font8">wrote that fairy tale probably gets so much a column for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pope’s fleet of four merchant vessels might even be carrying supplies to Benito and Adolf this very minute. This fleet, which flies the Papal flag, runs between Italy and South America. There are only about 1,000 persons in Vatican City, and all that they could consume could be conveniently brought in one small schooner or ocean-going tugboat; so why so many ships?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is another one, and quite recent too (March 6, 1943), in the Washington, D.C., </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald.</span><span class="font8"> The bold headline is “Vatican Flays Nazi Brutalities”. You read it over and don’t find anything whatever about either Nazism or Fascism, and you don’t know what it is all about until you get to the last paragraph, which reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The broadcast did not charge Germany directly with these acts, but the inference was clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You bet it was clear, clear as mud. The man who wrote the headlines knew he must work in that word “flays” </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">insert the word “Nazi” or he would </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font8">to go home Saturday night and tell the wife he had lost his jdb; so he fixed it to suit. The Hierarchy are not taking any back talk from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald.</span><span class="font8"> That’s the paper that refused to print Judge Rutherford’s address, even after they had set it in type, because he said something about an unnamed “foreign power” which the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald</span><span class="font8"> correctly judged might be intended to mean the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Glancing backward a little, the Kansas City </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font8"> had a two-column story about the pope’s most recent Christmas broad-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">cast, and gave it the stirring title “Pope Lashes Nazis”. If it were not for the waste of space, it would be a pleasure to reprint the whole broad-, cast, which contains not one single reference to the, Nazis. This was all home brew in Kansas City; the headline writer might even have had this lifte standing in type or had a slug on it, with instructions to work it in just so many times in a year, wherever it can be squeezed in. In the broadcast the pope as usual straddled the fence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the same broadcast, the Passaic (N. J.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-News</span><span class="font8"> cooked up the headline “The Sin of Totalitarianism”, while the Newark </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span><span class="font8"> made it “Brutality of Nazis Condemned by Pope”. The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Weekly People</span><span class="font8"> hit the nail on the head with their own summary of the same talk by a four-column headline which said truthfully, “U. S. Papers Twisting Papal Talk into Attacks on Fascists.” That is just the plain truth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>What Are the Facts?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">A single issue of the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Times</span><span class="font8"> (June 12, 1942) quotes an American journalist, Jack Fleishner, returning from Berlin to America, as saying that “the churches are filled, often to overflowing”, and a denial by Archbishop Conrad of Freiburg, Germany, that he had ever attacked National-Socialism. How does it come, if the pope is “lashing” and “flaying” around so savagely against Nazism that this archbishop denies that, as far as he himself is concerned, he had ever done anything of the kind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ Baptized a Catholic, and hating Jehovah’s witnesses with incredible feroci^ as the British government has adnSted in its White Paper, Hitler is stilr as good a Catholic and as perfect li^ehild of the Devil as he ever was. In the magazine </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Look</span><span class="font8"> it has been noted that though “Nazi leaders have mined <sub>t </sub>from the national reserve every spare bit of metal and other materials, even to the point of taking brass ash trays</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 1S, 1943 </span><span class="font8">from state railroad cars, only the wealth of the Church has remained relatively untouched”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Vatican’s strong influence with Hitler can be seen in the fact that: throughout central Yugoslavia the priests and teachers of the Greek Orthodox Church were moved to Rdfnan Catholic communities, so that nothing could interfere with the forward march of the Pacelli-Hitler conspiracy for world control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And, by the way, in the unlikely event that Hitler should win this war, this is just to tell you that the Roman Catholic Church would be made the official and only church of Great Britain and of the United States; that American public schools would all come under Roman Catholic control; that tithes would be exacted, certainly from Catholics and probably from all; that it would be stipulated that in the United States as in Argentina the president must be a Roman Catholic; that the America you have known would be only a memory, and a short one at that, for the history books would all be thrown into a big bonfire, along with the books put out by Jehovah’s witnesses, and new ones would be written to glorify the most accursed hypocrites and murderers that ever disgraced the planet.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Skilled Planners of Mischief</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">The Jesuits do not stumble into mischief. They plan it. The “Lord Haw Haw” whom they use in Berlin to ridicule Britain is William Joyce, born in New York city in 1906, and educated for his present work by the Jesuits in Ireland. He places Adolf Hitler on a par with one to whom he refers as Almighty God, but who is, in. deed and in truth, the real god of both Hitler and himself, and PacelU too, i.e., the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As showing the perfect system by which these murderers work, M. W. . Fodor, in a .story entitled “The New World War”, tells in the Chicago </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sun </span><span class="font8">(July 24, 1942) how, three days before</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chancellor Dollfuss of Austria was murdered by Hitler’s comrades (which took place less than one and a half years after Hitler’s rise to power in Germany), all newspapermen in Germany were told about the “Communist revolt” which would tak^ place in Vienna on the date | set. Pictures were taken in advance, so that the newspapers would have the latest photographic evidence of how Nazism had come to the rescue of Austria and of mankind. Four hours before the newspapermen at Vienna itself knew what had happened, the editor of an important Catholic paper in Vienna, Dr. Friedrich Funder, arrived on the scene and inquired for details about what had happened, when, as a matter of fact, it had not yet happened. He had been tipped off that it w’ould happen, and had been given the “story” he was to print.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How perfectly the Jesuits carry out their conspiracies! The only awkward thing about them is that they make their preparations so thoroughly, and so many people are in on it, that the truth occasionally leaks out, as in this instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' Geopolitics</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you can get hold of a copy of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Life, </span><span class="font8">of the issue of December 21, 1942, read the entire story entitled “Geopolitics”. Briefly summarized, it points to the fact that ocean control of the earth has ceased, and land control has come, because the air bases are situated thereon. Singapore’s guns were pointed the wrong way: they looked out to sea; the Japanese came by land. The essence of the study, which occupies eight pages, and is engagingly illustrated, is that whoever controls Russia will eventually control the whole earth, for the reason that planes centered there can go anywhere and back with the least resistance of time and space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You will be interested in the first three . paragraphs which, after pinning the bug on a Jestit priest, carefully remove it, sprinkle perfume on the spot, and give him a certificate calculated to divert all</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">suspicion from him as being in any way hooked up with this colossal Jesuit scheine for world control. The dame who was grabbed knew all the details of the-scheme and was useful to this Jesuit. The magazine, more or less deftly (and rather less than more), tries to inject a sex problem into a situation in which it</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' does not exist. But here it is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some months before the U. S. entered the war, the FBI picked up the trail of a German girl who had come to this country as a student. The girl, an attractive blonde, settled down in Washington, D. C., and began frequenting the campus of Georgetown University, which is not a coed institution. There she focused her attention on Father Edmund A. Walsh, Georgetown’s greatest scholastic luminary. She sought frequent conferences with him to . discuss her “studies”—in private. When he traveled to other cities to lecture, he would find the girl in his, audience. In order to assist the FBI, Father Walsh, after taking suitable precaution and placing a secretary near by, received the girl from time to time in a public office. If, as the FBI strongly suspected, the girl was a German agent sent to frame the good Father by creating a scandal, she never had a chance to carry out her plot. In December 1941, when the U. S. declared war on Germany, the girl was promptly picked up and taken before a special tribunal of the Department of Justice which found enough evidence to intern her for the duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now Father Walsh is a kindly, peaceable man, an eminent scholar and a Jesuit priest, hardly the man to inspire a foreign government to melodramatic plots against him. But the Gestapo might explain it in a word; Geopolitics. For the past 16 years Father Walsh has studied the rise of the German school of geopolitics and blazed the way for an America^ school fundamentally different in its objectives. His studies enabled him to analyze and forecast with remarkable accuracy the military power of both Germany and Russia. His classes at the Georgetown School of Foreign Service are attended by army officers and members of the diplomatic service. In the light of these facts it is not</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">surprising that the Nazis wanted to shut him up. They may well have wanted it badly enough to send a blonde agent to compromise him- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such goings on would seem scandalously oiit-of-place in most fields of scholarship. But with geopolitics they are quite a character. This applied science has had a brief but melodramatic history on the great stage of world politics. To most Americans the very word “geopolitics” has a sinister glamor. It comes from the German. It is tied up with the rise of the Nazi party and the German plans-for world domination. It suggests dark plots, evil intrigue and black magic.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>The Balkans Are Restive</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">The Balkans are restive over the Jesuit plan for world domination. There is a religious issue involved. No one ■knows this as well as Paeelli and Hitler. Their accord manifestly calls for the elimination of the Greek Orthodox clergy, and the work is well under way. Four ' high dignitaries of the Orthodox church were executed in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on a single morning. The charge against them was that they had permitted parachutists to hide in their churches. The charge may have been true: they knew they had to get either on the Vatican bandwagon or on the hearse, and they got on the hearse. A few days later, Adolf, an obedient son of the Roman church, ordered the dissolution of the Czech Orthodox church in the Nazi “protectorate” of Bohemia and Moravia, and the confiscation of their church properties. Adolf will surely be made a “saint” for all this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Jews, too, are catching it, James J. Murphy, in the magazine </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic,</span><span class="font8"> explains:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Right Reverend Joseph Tiso is Hitler’s pup pet-President of Slovakia. He was recently commended by the Nazi government for his ruthless liquidation of Jews. Pius XI honored Father Tiso by making him a papal chamberlain and member of the papal household. According to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jewish Telegraphic Agency News</span><span class="font6"> of August 18, Msgr. Tiso chose a Cath-</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 18, 1843 </span><span class="font6">olie church meeting in Holiteh to declare that in deporting Jews “Slovakia is acting in accordance with the Lord God’s command”. He added, “Slovakia wanted at last to be rid of its eternal enemies and in doing so acted in a primitive Christian way. We would be very badly off if we had not rid ourselves of this element harming the state.” The Vatican court and the pope have concurred in their silent approval of all that Msgr. Tiso has said and done to Nazify both church and state in Slovakia. [Tiso’s death was reported early in 1943.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of earth’s ablest mischief-makers, Franz von Papen, made the statement recently in Turkey that “Hitler may lose the war, but the Germans will not lose the peace”. He anticipates a Catholic federation of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Croatia, with Otto of Hapsburg as the ruler of the new, even if abbreviated, “Holy Roman Empire.” But the Czechs don’t want him. A recognized leader of Czechs in the United States, Oldrich Zlamal, of Cleveland, Ohio,-put it this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So far as the Hapsburg problem is concerned, it can be stated, without further discussion, that the Czechoslovak people will not listen to them. We are through with them once for ever and will never compromise with them. The Catholics are the last ones that would wish for their restoration. The politics of the Hapsburgs was one of the reasons why the Czech people parted with Rotne. They stood always as a barrier between our nation and the Holy See and were the very source of all difference and even the cause of Czech prejudice against Catholicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It seems necessary to explain that Mr. Zlamal is a monsignor of the Catholic Church, and he may be speaking for the Czech people and not speaking at all for himself. If the pope wants Otto to go in, why, in he goes, Zlamal or no Zlamal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just what form the “IToly Roman Empire” will take when it has fully emerged from the pit of oblivion will be interesting to watch and see. Meantime read the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Peace-Can It Last? </span><span class="font8">which is the most illuminating and in-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">structive presentation of this subject that has ever been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Notice the special favors that have been extended to Boman Catholic Croatia, mentioned by Sedgwick in the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> and observe how these 1 Roman Catholics have recompensed their * Greek Catholic neighbors in Yugoslavia, as narrated in the Manchester </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font6">meager information filtering through from Yugoslavia gives details of atrocities </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">carried </span><span class="font6">out with sadistic cruelty by Italians, Croatians, and Hungarians against the population to break their spirit of resistance. At Ljubljana 45 school girls of prominent families were taken to barracks and turned over to the lust of the Italian soldiers. Wild scenes followed, and the local population, alarmed by the cries of the girls, stormed the barracks and attacked the soldiers, with severe casualties on both sides. Complaint was addressed to the Vatican, but the only effect was the dismissal of the Italian police commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the village of Ogulin Croatian. Ustashis (terrorists) entered a church in which a Serbian wedding was being celebrated and took away the [Greek] priest, the bride and the groom, whose dead bodies were found with nails driven into their feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The occupation authorities in Belgrade have prohibited bathing, laundry washing, or drinking the water of the rivers Danube and Sava because of the great number of muti</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">lated </span><span class="font6">bodies of Serbian [Greek Catholic] men and women killed by the Hungarians [Roman Catholic] and thrown into the river that are floating downstream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Looking Toward the East</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Looking toward the east, first comes Poland, and Poland was the first to feel the undiluted wrath of Hitler. The “Reverend” Dr. John C. Heenan, in an address at Manchester, England, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The devotion of the Polish people to Mary, the Queen of Poland, has been such as to compel the admiration of the whole Catholic world. What great things could the Russian people, already doing great things, not do if they were marching under the banner of the Legion of Mary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The headline of this story was “Poles Will Give Our Lady Back to Russia”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Farther east is Finland. There are almost no Catholics in Finland or Sweden, yet Hitler is so faithful to the “church” of his choice that he has compelled both these countries, to send representatives to the Vatican. The West Virginia edition of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Register</span><span class="font8"> (Roman Catholic) carries a story with the headline, “Finland Seeks to Spread Work of Catholic Church,” which is just a plain lie. There are only 2,000 Catholics in Finland all together. Finland is going along with Hitler because it must. Sweden is in the same predicament. Maps, printed in Germany, show Sweden as a part of Hitler’s New Order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next to the east is the world’s geo-politic center, Russia. The Roman Catholic Church has long had in mind to swallow up the Greek' Catholic Church, as a big snake swallows a little one. This work is now under way in Occupied Russia under the leadership of Cardinal Levitrano, of Palermo, Italy, • who has for years been training priests for this very work. As the Italian soldiers marched into Russia the soldiers distributed pictures of “saints” popular in Russia. Italian priests, Jesuit trained, selected such pictures as they calculated would make the biggest hit both with the Italians and with the Ukrainians.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Far to the East Is Canada</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Far, far to the east is Canada; or if you choose to go west it is the same. One of the best-posted men on Canadian ffffairs is J. J. Murphy, of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Converted Catholic</span><span class="font8"> magazine, who was educated in Montreal and knows whereof he speaks. Rome is in Quebec in full power, and assuredly all roads lead to 'it from the most powerful and privileged ecclesiastical body’ in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Murphy declares that Catholic church property and securities constitute 10 percent of the total wealth of the province. There is a compulsory church tax of 4 percent on all farm produce, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">this takes precedence over other taxes. Failure to pay the priest means imprisonment. Auctions are subject to a church tithe. Alt church schools, welfare institutions and asylums are financed by the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With about the same population and the same total wealth as the Protestant province of Ontario, the province of . Quebec produces only half the farm revenue, and has only half as many telephones and a third as many automobiles. It has twice as great infant mortality, more than twice the tuberculosis death rate, and almost twice the contagious disease death rate. It expends only half as much for education. The average teacher’s salary is less than half. The percentage of illiterates is double. The number of public libraries is but 26 in Quebec as against 460 in Ontario.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cardinal Villeneuve, real boss of all Quebec, described democracy as ‘'wild, lying, atheistic democracy&quot; and referred to the United States as an “ogre&quot;. Canada is already 41-percent Roman Catholic, and it is confidently anticipated that by 1970 the Roman Catholic population will be in the majority and Canada will cease to be Protestant, progressive or intelligent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In one of his addresses Mr. Murphy says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting to note that official Nazi declarations contained in reports to the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> in April, 1940, declared that the real purpose of the present war is, not the overthrowing of the principles of the Versailles. Treaty, but the destruction of the principles of the Treaty of Westphalia, which, they declared, were the beginning of our present “democratic corruption&quot;. It added that it was the intention of the Nazi government, at the successful conclusion of the war, tn sign the treaty of peace at Westphalia to wipe out the sordid memory of the treaty signed there three hundred years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The battle of Authoritarianism against Individualism has been carried on from the time of the Reformation by the Jesuits, the founders of the eounter-Reformation. They have never ceased to long for the day when an end could be put to Protestantism and the individual liberties for which it stands. They looked forward to the re-establishment of the Holy Roman Empire, which would restore the Church to its medieval political power. In the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font6"> of Kaiser Wilhelm II, page 211, we find him narrating the following conversation held at the Vatican, at the time of his last visit with Pope Leo XIII:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It was of interest to me that the Pope said to me on this occasion that Germany must become the sword of the Catholic church. I remarked that the old Holy Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed, and that conditions had changed. But he stuck to his words.” </span><span class="font8">Rome never changes. And all roads still lead to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Murdered</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">P</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">rofessor Colston E. Warne, president of Consumer’s Union, was a man who believed in the all-time American tradition of freedom of speech. To honest folks, freedom of speech used to mean the liberty and opportunity to speak the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Professor Warne wanted to tell his fellow citizens how the press and radio are feeding them devilish falsehoods instead of truth, he bumped head on against the fact that the advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 18, 1943</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Free Speech?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">racket brings publishers $2,000,000,000 (yes, two billion dollars) a year, and the American Newspaper Publishers Association maintains the strongest lobby, in Washington (except, maybe, the American Legion lobby) for just such purposes as fighting down Congressional measures that might keep drugmakers and other racketeers from poisoning and cheating the people. These vile and deathdealing “business” concerns are among the chief advertisers; and newspapers and radio being both in their hire, neither could afford to give Professor Warne time and space to expose their rackets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Finally, the Columbia Broadcasting Company, on condition that he should not mention the names of offending manufacturers and their offenses, agreed to give Professor Warne thirteen (13) minutes. No doubt the things he wanted, to tell the people would have made a honey of a broadcast; for even after the real meat was eliminated there were some juicy morsels left:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indeed, for a good many years advertis</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">has been a blending of downright lies, slippery superlatives, pseudo science and irrelevant appeals. The more honest leaders of the industry have repeatedly sought to check its excesses by self-regulation and co-operation with federal authorities. Yet its basic insincerity has persisted, and has caused consumers to call down a plague on its house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our indictment of current advertising practice, as I see it, runs something as follows: We feel that advertising has, by its frequent abuse, (1) stressed inconsequential values; (2) brought a false perspective as to the merits of products, often bewildering rather than informing; (3) lowered the ethical standards by insincerity in its appeals; (4) corrupted and distorted the press; (5) wasted much good timber and chemicals and spoiled much landscape and radio enjoyment; (6) blocked the speedy use of correct medication; (7) created many parental problems by abominable programs for children (I speak with feeling about this); (8) turned our society into one dominated by style, fashion, “keeping up with the Joneses”; (9) retarded the growth of thrift by emphasizing immediate expenditure; and (10) advertising has fostered monopoly through its large-scale use by only a few flnaneially-favored companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These opinions are not mine alone. They represent the attitude of millions of Americans who resent being pestered to death by advertising twaddle. We realize that on occasion advertisements are valuable, and that advertising furnishes revenue for the radio and press. But we would gladly pay in one lump sum the true cost of keeping good programs on the air and having news, if we could be spared the bother of wading kneedeep in questionable advertisements wherever we go. We might feel differently about this if we were able to detect any distinct connection between the amount of advertising of a product and its quality. But we cannot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let me review briefly a few of the highlights of Consumer's Union findings about quality in some highly advertised lines. We have discovered (and you can check this in your own home) that in a true blindfold test, covering leading brands of cigarettes,_ the usual smoker cannot detect his own favorite brand, and he cannot tell the difference between 10c and 15c brands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Consumer’s Union has also accented the opinion of medical authorities, that all so-called “eold cures”, sold by high-pressure advertising, are frauds and that laxatives are valueless for the treatment of colds. Furthermore, we question whether the ordinary person has any great need for dosing with vitamin tablets or following the advertisers’ advice and getting vitamins through cough drops or skin cream. Dietary problems should be solved by impartial medical advice, not by shouted claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Consumer’s Union has repeatedly pointed out that high-priced cosmetics, cold creams, lotions and tooth pastes are primarily compounded out of advertising. Most of them are safe, but they are distinctly not best buys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you ever want to observe the depths to which advertising has plumbed, you should note the “cease-and-desist” orders issued by the badly overworked Federal Trade Commission. Their docket has 1,300 cases to be heard and covers only the more flagrant instances of advertising abuse; still, in recent years they have bagged hundreds of leading companies for making false advertising claims. These cease-and-desist orders of the Federal Trade Commission are not printed in the daily papers (that would be indiscreet), and I confess I have never heard one over the air. (You might write your local station, asking why.) I had culled for this broadcast a few typical Federal Trade Commission cease-and-desist orders and stipulations, orders which involved leading companies, and I hoped to read that list. Unfortunately, the counsel for the Columbia Broadcasting Company insists that I shall not mention on this broadcast the names of the offending companies and their offenses, due to the possible liability of the broadcasting system. Though I disagree with this policy, I must in courtesy comply. If you wish information concerning companies on the Federal Trade Commission dishonor roll,' write tnern at Washington or address Consumer’s Union at New York City. From the record it is clear that in many fields the American consumer has often been the unwilling victim of ^ross deceit and undue pressure.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The “Holy Water&quot; Spigot</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, one doesn’t always have to buy advertising to influence the news. The women don’t do it that way. Some men practice such unspeakable methods in running their newspapers that they seem to feel that only “holy water” will save them, and to please the Singing Harlot they will print any lie, no matter how big it may be. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, there is friend Hearst, owner of 220,000 acres of Mexican lands, taken from the peasants. When a liberal Mexican regime threatened to confiscate this property and that of the “church” for the benefit of the Mexican people, these two leeches, Hearst and the Hierarchy, found in each other the most ardent supporter in trying to engage Uncle Sam in a war with Mexico. Newspapermen agree that Hearst is the most notorious Red baiter and labor fighter; and the New York State Supreme Court labeled him anti-Semitic; so Hearst and the Hierarchy take to each other like ducks to the water, as graphically shown by George Seldes in his book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Lords of the Press,</span><span class="font8"> page 215:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Hearst press the same trickery is used in the general Red-baiting campaign in every town. It is very easy to call up the head of the American Legion, the leading Daughter of the American Revolution, the loudest Knight of Columbus or other Catholic organization with which Hearst has worked ever</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">So, you see, to control the press, the Hierarchy don’t have to take out big advertisements announcing that “Pius is w<sup>T</sup>ell aw<sup>T</sup>are that the Catholic Church can never hope again to dominate the civilized world until America kneels, beaten and penitent, at her feet”. Nah, nah! Better'ways to kill the goose. The thing has to be slipped over discreetly, and takes Jesuit cunning and long planning, A Catholic press itself alone could not do the trick, for reasons apparent in these words from E. Boyd Barrett’s </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer,</span><span class="font8"> page 93: &nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic Press in its present phase [1935] is a fighting Press. Its effort is expended in stirring up Catholies to more and more action, so that the great victory [domination of America] may be achieved. It is reckless, truculent and violent in its methods. Part of it descends to vulgar abusiveness; part of it is almost maniacal in its fury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In other words, Americans, used to liberty and independence, would not stand for such bulldozing, so the Hierarchy had to concoct methods by which to pour its virus beyond the narrow confines of its 'own publications into the general press, until everybody’s press became what it now is, a Catholic press “under the able supervision of the National Catholic Welfare Conference”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Barrett continues:'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Catholic ideas and Catholic news items have poured into the public mind through a thousand channels. In the pages of the public press reports of Catholic ceremonies, functions, speeches, activities and so forth have mysteriously outnumbered and outspaeed reports of all non-Catholic religious events combined. On the air Catholics have considerably more than their proportionate share of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hierarchy Double-Talk</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. Ex-priest Barrett wrote those words seven years ago, and the average American still loves to think that this is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">land of free speech, still looks to his newspaper and radio for facts and figures, and, without blinking an eye, swallows huge and devilish lies about how Hitler and Japan are destroying the “church”. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">_ The American public has been lulled Itp sleep by the diabolical double-talk carried on by the Hierarchy, w<sup>T</sup>hich cries on Uncle Sam’s shoulder about Axis “persecution’7 at the same time that it cries on Hitler’s and Hirohito’s shoulders about Anglo-American and Communist “persecution”. This devilish system got fully under way back when Hitler, Mussolini and Franco were pulverizing the Spanish Republic, as may be seen from another item from Mr. Seldes’ book, at page 166: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But a new element entered into the [Spanish] war: the Catholic church. It sided with the rebels. The rebels had sworn to return the church to power. . . . The American press got its .first facts fairly straight. Its errors were unintentional. But from the beginning of August, 1936, the Catholic Hierarchy in America, as distinguished from the Hierarchy in Europe, where no such attempt was made, began a crusade against the newspapers which truthfully reported events in Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now you see! There’s the Hierarchy </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font8">Europe. Here’s the Hierarchy in America. Two different packs of liars, from the same house, of course (the Devil’s house: see Matthew 12:25,26; 1 Corinthians 14:33; John 8:44). The Europeap Hierarchy boasts lustily that “the Third Reich is the first power in the world not only to recognize but to translate into practice the high principles of the Papacy” (Papal Chamberlain</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">von Papen), and, to prove that its heart is where its mouth is, furnished gobs of specially trained priests to follow “Holy Crusader” Hitler into Orthodox Catholic Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Meanwhile, over here, the newspapers and radios blare and scream heart-rending stories of how “Catholic bishops fight Nazis by restating rights of man”, quoting liberally from some “pastoral letters” showing how Catholic bishops are throwing everything into Hitler’s teeth from the American Declaration of Independence to “holy water”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Over there, a “great jubilant cry” goes up when the bishops of Fulda pledge to their 'dear Adolf’ that “as Catholics we are ready, in spite of the mistrust shown toward us [even Hitler mistrusts such vipers], to give to the State what belongs to it, and to support the fuehrer in his struggle against Bolshevism and in his other tasks” (his “other tasks” being to smash all nations that stand in the way of “the high principles of the Papacy”), Here, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Readers Digest</span><span class="font8"> publishes a superman yarn about “the heroic defense of the Philippines” in which windy epic a colonel and a corporal are riding in a truck with a Jesuit priest, and as they pass through the Japanese lines the colonel and the corporal kind of “seroneh” down in their seats while “the priest sat bolt upright”. As we thrill and trill to the tips of our toes at the bravery of this Jesuit, Tokyo and the Vatican are chuckling to each other over their concordat and wondering how on earth Americans can continue to be such superlatively idiotic fools.—Marley Cole, Tennessee.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">man Catholicism into what is styled as a “pure Japanese form of Christianity”. When it is known that there is very little difference between the outward forms and the teachings of Buddhism and Roman Catholicism, the reason for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rapid growth of Roman Catholicism in Japan and its recognition by the Japanese government as an approved religion becomes clear. ,*</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Rapid Spread of Buddhism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Buddhism was first introduced into Japan in A.D, 552, The religion spread rapidly after it received the imperial favor. This it did the more readily as, with rubber-like elasticity, it stretched itself to include the greater part of the more ancient Japanese faith, Shintoism. Who can fail to trace a comparison in this with the conversion of the emperor Constantine to “Christianity’&quot; as misrepresented by the Papacy, and its policy of incorporating within its rites the devotions of the pagan nations which were in subjection to the Boman Empire?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By this time the original Buddhism of India had been very greatly altered. It now had a vast and complicated ecclesiastical and monastic machinery, a sensuous paradise, definitely located “hells” and “purgatories”, of which the priests kept the .keys, regulated the thermometers, and timed or graded the torture or bliss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Tokyo, the most famous temple of all is the temple of Kwanon, at Asakusa'. The great altar, on which is a splendid gilt statue of Kwanon, is protected by a wire screen. Before the screen is a large coffer, and into this each worshiper before engaging in prayer easts a coin. Then he kneels, repeating his prayers and telling his beads. Often one will buy from the priest a written prayer, put it in his mouth and chew it to a pulp, and then throw the “spitball” at the screen. . If it sticks, he believes the prayer will be heard; if it falls, he expects the prayer to fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By making gifts of money the worshipers may have extra candles, representing special prayers for-themselves, placed on the altars by the priests. The moment a person dies in Japan, priests are immediately sent for, who light the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 18, 1943 </span><span class="font8">candles and who recite their prayers. The priests, carrying their rosaries, head the funeral procession as it goes to the temple, where religious ceremonies are performed with more or less pomp, depending on the wealth of those who pay the priests for the services. The relatives pray for the deceased, that he may be freed from the pains of “purgatory”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The above description of Buddhist rites and beliefs, and which include the use of penance, fasting, pilgrimages, convents, amulets (“blessed” medals), holy water, celibacy of priesthood, rosaries, candles, and even the reading of the sacred Buddhist books to the people in an unknown tongue, finds its exact counterpart in the rites and beliefs of the Roman Catholic religion. In the latter, Jesus takes the place of Kwanon, and the “Virgin Mary” the place of the Buddhist “Goddess of Mercy” who 'delivers souls from “purgatory” ’. The Catholic “saints” find their counterpart in the Buddhist “patron gods” who 'preside over the different pursuits and callings of men’. .As it is obviously to the interests of the priests to encourage worship, of whatever kind, at their temples, there has never been any difficulty in adding a god or two to the Pantheon; and that goes for Roman Catholicism too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With this information before us, it is at once seen that there is nothing in the least ludicrous in the union of Shintoism, Buddhism, and Catholicism into a “pure Japanese form of Christianity”, except that the term should be changed to read “pure Japanese form of Roman Catholicism”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Worst</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Judgment of Religious Court</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">F</span><span class="font8">OR three and a half years the Son of man went about in the earth and taught and ministered to the people and did good to everyone and evil to none. All the time that He was thus ministering and doing good in Palestine, the religious scribes, Pharisees, doctors of the law, and other religious dupes engaged in misrepresenting and persecuting this Son of God, sought to kill Him. Why did they do this? Because, as He told them, they were instruments of Satan the Devil, the first murderer.—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Devil knew that Christ Jesus -was and is the promised Seed whom Jehovah God had promised to the patriarch Abraham and in whom all families of the earth should be blessed. (Genesis 22:18) Christ Jesus is also the Seed of God’s woman foretold in the divine statement at Genesis 3:15. That Old Serpent, the Devil, therefore, in every way sought to destroy Jesus, who was teaching the Jews the message of God to lead them in the right way, and to open to them the &quot;way of everlasting life. Jewry’s scribes and Pharisees were opposing Him and therefore were the enemies of the people. Jesus said of them: “The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat” (Matthew 23:2); meaning that they had assumed the position of leaders of the people. Because they blinded the people Jesus said to them: ‘You are hypocrites, blind guide's, fools; you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; you devour widows’ houses and fbr </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">pretense make long prayers; you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gehenna</span><span class="font8"> than yourselves. You are guilty of fraud and deceit, and you are like white sepulchers, which are full of dead men’s bones and of all uncleanness; you are serpents, a generation of vipers. You do not understand my speech because you cannot hear and understand my word. You are of your father the Devil.’—See Matthew 23:13-33; John 8:43,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus foreknew Tie was to die on the tree, and He told His disciples of His coming death. The last night He was on earth with them He spent teaching them great truths which not only were a blessing to them but have been a great blessing to everyone from then till now who has loved the Txjrd and sought to know and do His will. While Jesus was thus doing, th'e enemy was preparing to take His life. The Sanhedrin was then the high tribunal or religious court, composed of seventy-three men, made up of priests, elders, and doctors of the law, religious hypocrites, the seed of the Serpent, blinded to God’s purposes. That body was the highest court of Israel, and it was the duty of this court to protect the innocent as well as to punish the guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The members of the Sanhedrin beheld Jesus doing good and the people Hocking to Him. “Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council [a court], and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take a-way both our place and nation. And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he' prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation. Then from • that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.”—John 11:4751, 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In other words, this supreme tribunal secretly met, indicted Jesus, prejudged His case, and agreed to put Him to death, only waiting for an opportunity. They acted as grand jury, prosecutor, and trial court. They entered into a wicked conspiracy, which was formulated by Satan, their father, for the destruction of the Son of God. They conspired with Judas and hired him, for the paltry sum of thirty pieces of silver, to betray the Lord into their hands. Satan himself entered into Judas as the latter executed the betrayal. Then they organized a mob, sent it out after the Master, arrested Him, and brought Him before this supreme court for trial at night, which was contrary’’ to their own laws. “They that had laid hold on Jesu^ led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled,” in furtherance of the wicked religious conspiracy’.—-Matthew’ 26:57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The meek and defenseless Lamb of God was led into a den of ravenous wolves thirsting for His blood. They did not dignify His case by even filing a formal charge against Him. They Sought, contrary to the law, to make Him testify against himself. They knew nothing themselves against Him. Notwithstanding that they sat as the high and dignified court of the nation of Israel, they resorted to subornation of perjury’. “The chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; but found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, y’et found they none. At the last came two false witnesses.” This exalted tribunal, in violation of every law and precedent known to Jewish jurispru? dence, demanded that Jesus testify against himself. “The high priest arose, and said unto him, ... I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.” When He told the truth, saying, “Ye say that I am,” they said, “What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.” (Matthew 26: 59-63; Luke 22: 66-71) They immediately voted that He should die, also contrary to their law, w’hieh required that each member of the court should consider the case and then vote individually’. Holding the session of court at night to convict Him, they knew they’ were proceeding contrary to law; so they’ convened the court the following morning to ratify the sentence, which was likewise contrary to law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then they condemned Jesus to death. Knowing they’ had no legal power to put Him to death, they led Him before the Roman governor, Pilate, and placed against Him the charge of sedition, saying: “We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.” They’ knew the Roman governor had power to put Jesus to death, and for this reason they sought his judgment.—Luke 23:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pilate, not convinced of Jesus’ guilt, was not willing that He should die, but sought to release Him. “And they’ were the more fierce, saying, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">He stirreth up . the people. . . </span><span class="font8">. And they’ were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</span><span class="font8"> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.” (Luke 23:4-24) Thus the political power yielded to the importunities of religious ecclesiasticism, and Jesus was led away’ and impaled at Calvary. And Pilate, more honest than the religious judiciary,.posted over Jesus’ head the sign: “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” Thus was executed the worst judgment of a religious court, the forerunner of the wicked judgment that like religious courts of “Christendom” would execute upon those who are faithfully conformed to the image of Christ Jesus as a witness of Jehovah God.</span></p>

Their zeal does not grow cold with the weather. (1) Toledo, Ohio, pioneer witnesses at their pioneer home, ready for service. (2) Pioneer Brehmer, in Illinois, takes a look at the situation and wonders whether his car will require thawing out.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Apartment Tenants Win Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font8">N July 4, 1776, delegates from thirteen American colonies signed their names tp the Declaration of Independence/ beneath these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty andAhe pursuit of happiness. That to secure these,rights, governments are instituted among mem . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would';seem almost incredible that now, after &quot;the elapse of 167 years, a condition could exist whereby millions of American citizens, as a class, are denied their right to enjoy the benefits of this great pronouncement of fundamental law. It is a fact, however, that a large portion of the population of this country, living in apartment houses, company-owned towns, boarding houses, and similar buildings, have, by the enforcement of arbitrary rules and regulations adopted by managers and owners of such buildings, been virtually separated from the rest of the population and deprived of their right to enjoy the &quot;four freedoms’*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A typical situation recently existed in an apartment hotise at Lynn, Massachusetts. The owner &lt;jf this particular building apparently was under the impression that he was the warden of a branch of the state penitentiary. The only plausible explanation of his actions is that he was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 18,1943 </span><span class="font8">deliberately trying to twist the stars and stripes ipto the shape of a swastika. We can judge only from his own expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It seems that this particular fellow, on a morning not long ago, saw two men walk into the vestibule of his apartment house carrying with them what suspiciously appeared to be Bibles. Fearing that these men might have entered his building with intention of bringing some of his tenants the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font8"> concerning God’s Word, he rushed after them. He caught them just as they were in the act of ringing the first of the 25 doorbells in the vestibule. He saw that they were carrying portable phonographs and Bible literature, and his worst fears were confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>The Flag Disgraced</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;You’re Jehovah’s witnesses!” he squealed in excited tones. “See that flagl” gesturing toward the symbol of freedom hanging in the doorway. &quot;Get to hell out of here!” The men looked at the flag, but apparently they couldn’t see anywhere on it the implication that might indicate that it was unlawful for them to preach the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom; so they courteously replied that they were ministers and that they intended to call on the tenants for the purpose of “bringing comfort and showing the people of good-will the only means of salvation from this present world dis</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19 </span><span class="font8">tress, and pointing out that The Theocracy is the means whereby men will receive complete deliverance and salvation from this present conflict”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first bell was then pushed again, with no response. At this the vituperative threats of the'landlord scaled up an octave and became steadily louder as the two proceeded with their work. As it became evident that they were not to be dislodged with these heated breathings, the landlord beat a hasty retreat to summon a police officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A few minutes later a breathless, anxious-eyed policeman dashed into the apartment house, and, looking down the hallway, was horrified to see the two men playing their phonograph for one of the tenants who was intently listening to the instructive words of the Bible discourse. Drawing himself up to his full height of five feet, the policeman walked down the hallway with the landlord and planted himself directly behind the two men, who were then explaining that the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font8"> which they were placing with the people, “pointed out how the time had arrived for the thousand-year reign of Christ.” When they had finished the call, the policeman loudly cleared his throat and, fingering his large, shiny chromium badge, suggested that they all “step out into the vestibule”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Now, see here,” he began in a kindly tone of voice that sounded strangely like the wolf dressed in the grandmother’s gown speaking to Little Red Ridinghood, “you can’t do this work in here.” To this the two men replied that the work they were doing was of the greatest importance to the tenants in that building and that they could not stop the work upon his request; whereupon one of them started to push the button to apartment number nine. “If you ring another bell, I’ll—III arrest you!” he shrilled. The landlord gasped as he heard the whirr of the bell in apartment nine. It took a moment for „.-&quot;A him to regain his composure; then he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' \ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">screeched, “Arrest them, Officer; afrest them I” The policeman was glad to oblige, and he hustled them out the doorway where the symbol of freedom hung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The ensuing scenes in the courtroom resulted in the usual conviction of the defendants. An appeal was then taken to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and the whole matter was laid before that bqdy. If the landlord had ever entertained any idea that the tenants in his apartment were living under a vassalage arrangement whereby he was constituted as the fuedal lord, empowered to act as the custodian of the individual consciences of mere servile bondsmen, then April 26, 1943, was emancipation day for the 25 families living in the apartment house at Lynn, Massachusetts. On that day the high court for the State of Massachusetts invoked the provisions of the Constitution and struck some real blows for freedom. The case is titled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Richardson,</span><span class="font8"> and is cited as 48 N.E. 2d 678. The opinion of the court may be divided into four important holdings, each of which will gladden the heart of those honest Americans who desire to see liberty perpetuated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Proper Ministerial Pursuit</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">First.</span><span class="font8"> The court held that to preach the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom from door to door by means of verbal and phonographic testimony and by distributing Bible literature is both a proper and a lawful ministerial pursuit, and does not constitute the persons engaged therein as “peddlers or agents or canvassers”. The court held:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The purpose of the defendants was to spread the teachings of their religious faith. To go from house to house for that purpose was a lawful pursuit, and one in the exercise of which the defendants could not be restrained except in so far as those having the legal control of the premises, that is, the right to grant or deny them admission, should see fit to deny admission. See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Largent</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Texas,</span><span class="font6"> 318 U. S.—, 63 S. Ct. 667. [Decided March 8,1943]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without intimating that the rule would be otherwise in the ease of “peddlers or agents or canvassers” pursuing their business lawfully, we think that the defendants, who were engaged in seeking to spread their religion, could notrbe found properly to come within the category of “peddlers or agents or canvassers”. It has been held in many cases that ordinances regulating the conduct of such persons cannot' be extended to cover the activities of ministers who go about on the streets or from house to house preaching or distributing or selling literature relating to their faith. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Griffin,</span><span class="font6"> 303 U.

Meredith,</span><span class="font6"> 197 S.C. 351. The statute with which we are concerned in the present case cannot properly be construed to restrict the defendants from going from house to house in pursuit of their religious calling. It does not purport to do so. Its only purpose is to protect the rights of those in lawful control of property to forbid entrance by those whom they are unwilling to receive, and to exclude them if, having entered, those in control see fit to command them to leave. Properly applied the statute does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution oi&gt; the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This represents a real victory, for it emphasizes the true character of the work earned on by Jehovah’s witnesses. The two defendants in this case were not carrying on a peddling business in any sense of the word. They were in the apartment house for the one object of telling the people of God’s kingdom. This puts their work within the protected area of the First Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, even if the apartment house had a rule agreed to by all the tenants that peddlers, solicitors and canvassers should not be permitted to carry their activity into the house, such rule would not in the least affect the right of ordained ministers, Jehovah’s wit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUQUST 18, 1843 </span><span class="font8">nesses, preaching the Word of God, to call on the tenants with the message of truth. Therefore the holding of the Massachusetts court that this activity is both a proper and lawful ministerial pursuit is a welcome pronouncement to those who love freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Doorbell-Ringing Not Trespass</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Second.</span><span class="font8"> The court held that entering upon the premises belonging to other persons at usual or reasonable hours in a customary manner, for the purpose of ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door, cannot be regarded as a trespass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. . . there are cases . . . where the law will imply a license, in the absence of any proof of direct authority, from the necessities of individuals and the usages of the community. Thus it has been held that the entry upon another’s close, or into his house, at usual and reasonable hours, and in a customary manner, for any of the common purposes of life, cannot be regarded as a trespass. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">license may be implied from the habits of the country. [Citing many eases]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The implication is that such is a part of the institution of free communication of ideas that must not be abridged either by legislative action or judicial interpretation. This pronouncement preceded the similar holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Martin</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Struthers</span><span class="font8"> (Ohio) by just one week. In this latter holding the United ■States Supreme Court implied that cranks, wishing to avert having their mental processes stirred out of inactivity, could easily erect a sign or notice on their door stating that Jehovah’s witnesses were not to disturb them, but that such cranks could not by the passage of any ordinance (or as in this case by the landlord’s enforcement of his own rule) deprive other persons of their constitutional right to have the gospel of God’s kingdom brought to their door. We believe that this is the only proper and reasonable view that can be taken of the matter under the democratic system of government.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Ministers Are Licensees and Guests</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Third.</span><span class="font8"> The court said that landlords, nlanagers and owners of apartment . houses and similar buildings may not lawfully order Jehovah’s witnesses to leave the premises while they are en-’ gaged in calling on the tenants in the 1 building, because while so engaged they are implied licensees, and when interviewing the tenants they are invited guests. The court reasoned that the tenants leased or rented the apartment and that this carried with it the right to use the halls and doorways in connection with their dwelling spaces. This right, according to the court’s opinion, extends not only to the family living in the apartment, but to their guests and all other persons having legitimate business with the family. The doorbells are provided for each apartment so that callers may summon the occupants of the apartment to the door, and, therefore, one of Jehovah’s witnesses who stands in the vestibule or hallway of an apartment house or similar building and rings any of these bells becomes what is known under the law as a “licensee”. This simply means that he is on the property for a legitimate reason and by an invitation implied from the existence of the doorbell or knocker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though the property may belong to a , private owner, when he leases the' property to tenants it then losesdts character-: istic as “private property” and the fact that he is the owner can carry'no partic-. ular weight when it comes to ordering unwanted visitors off the premises. This portion of the court’s opinion reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whether the defendants entered the common passageways of the building in question in violation of the statute depends upon the extent of the control of the landlord thereof, and that of the respective tenants. It is settled that, when a landlord lets property to be occupied by several tenants, although he retains for certain purposes control of the common doorways, passageways, stairways and the like, he grants to his tenants a right of way in the nature of an easement, appurtenant to the premises let, through those places that afford access thereto. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hart</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cole,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 156 </span><span class="font6">Mass. 475, 476. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tremont Theatre Amusement Co.</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bruno,</span><span class="font6"> 225 Mass. 461, 463. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Melville * Shoe Corp.</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kosminsky,</span><span class="font6"> 268 Mass. 172, 180, This is necessarily so since “the grant of any thing carries an implication, that the grantee shall have all that is necessary to the enjoyment of the grant, so far as the grantor has power to give it.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Salisbury</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Andrews,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 19 </span><span class="font6">Pick. 250, 255. It is also settled that this ease*, ment extends to the members of the tenant’s family and to all his guests and invitees. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bacon </span><span class="font6">v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jaques,</span><span class="font6"> 312 Mass. 371, 373, and cases cited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is unnecessary to decide whether the evidence in the ease at bar would warrant a finding that, in gaining access to the tenants of the apartments in question, by the act of the occupants in releasing the lock on the inner vestibule door, the defendants were implied invitees of the tenants, since we are of opinion that upon the evidence no other finding properly could be made than that, in gaining admission to the inner corridors or halls where the apartments in question were located, the defendants were at least licensees of the respective tenants who afforded them the opportunity to enter and state their mission.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Tenants Have Rights</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Fourth.</span><span class="font8"> The court held that individual tenants may in their own discretion refuse to see Jehovah’s witnesses or may order them to leave their apartment or doorway, but they may not • lawfully prevent them from calling on other tenants in the building. Correctly stating the principle of law, the court said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the instant case the defendants were lawfully in the vestibule, where the means for communicating with the respective tenants had been installed that the tenants might at will release the lock and give access to those seeking to see them. Of course they eould decline to do so if they saw fit. The releasing of the lock we think must be held to have at least conferred upon the defendants a license or permission to enter the inner halls, to approach the apartments in question, and if permitted by the tenant, to state the object of their call. This was a license for the tenants </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">■ to </span><span class="font6">grant or withhold, one embraced within the easement conferred upon them by the letting, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font6">which subsisted until revoked </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">the tenants, and one which the tenants could exercise notwithstanding objections of the landlord, who could not revoke the license any more than he could an invitation extended by the tenant to one calling upon any legitimate business. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freeman</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Wright,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 113 </span><span class="font6">Hl. App. 159, 161. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">State</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lawson,</span><span class="font6"> 101 N. C. 717. The response to the bells in the case at bar and the releasing of the lock of the inner vestibule door constituted a license or permission to the defendants to enter, to identify themselves, and to disclose the purpose of their visit. In so entering we think that it could not be found rightly that they had entered after having been forbidden &quot;so to do” in violation of the statute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus again the principle is stressed that an apartment house is really nothing more than a collective group of individual homes in which the respective tenants are for all purposes under no more restrictions than any other citizen. Obviously, one' citizen has no right to stand in front of his neighbor’s house and prevent anyone from calling there. For the identical reason one tenant in an apartment house cannot stand in front of his neighbor’s door'and turn away all visitors.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus clarified, it now appears that the respective rights of all parties are by this opinion set in their proper orbits. The landlord, by leasing of renting his property, loses his right to dictate who shall call on the tenants. The occupants alone have the right to talk or not to talk with Jehovah’s witnesses as they may think best. Jehovah’s witnesses, on the other hand, are engaged in a Christian work and by going from door to door are preaching the gospel in a proper manner. When they knock on a door or ring a doorbell to summon the occupant they are not trespassers, and as long as the occupant has not requested them to lea^e they are licensees or guests upon the property. Jehovah’s witnesses are not obliged to desist from preaching the gospel to the tenants in an apartment house simply upon the demand of a police officer, the owner, manager, or any other unauthorized person. Furthermore, not only do these principles apply to apartment houses, but the same rules apply to hotels, boarding houses, office buildings, company-owned towns, and similar places where the people living therein pay rent or hold a lease for the use of their dwelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This decision by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts does not conclusively settle these questions for the entire United States. However, the opinion is well considered and accurately states the applicable rules of law based on the Constitution of the United States. For that reason it will be a persuasive authority in every court where similar questions may arise.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>“Four Freedoms” Clarified</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">But most powerful of all is the persuasion of the reasoning of the matter itself. The Supreme Court of the United States has now restored the “four freedoms” to the 'high estate’ they properly deserve, declaring that they are an essential part of the system of democracy, and that their exercise by an intelligent citizenry is the surest safeguard against the encroachments of totalitarianism. That high court envisioned that every person ■ should have not only the right of freedom of speech, but the right of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">freedom to listen;</span><span class="font8"> not only the right of freedom of press, but the right of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">freedom to read;</span><span class="font8"> not only the right of free- ' dom to worship God as His minister, but the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">right to have God's Word explained to him.</span><span class="font8"> Only when the freedoms are thus viewed do they carry any meaning at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why, then, should tenants in apartment houses be separated from the rest of the population and denied their constitutional right to benefit from the exer-else of these freedoms? By what legitimate right does the owner of an apartment house or tenement arbitrarily . enforce rules depriving his tenants of their heritage as American citizens and placing them in the relative position of * medieval vassals? Where the constitu-4 tional rights of the people are involved, why does a landlord stand in relation to his tenants in any better position than a mayor of a town stands in relation to his constituents? The answer is that since the feudal system of government was never adopted in America, there are no special rights conferred on a landlord that will permit him to enforce any rule that will deprive his tenants of their rights under the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In recognizing this great principle the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has clarified a matter that has long put a serious handicap on a tremendous number of Americans living in apartments and similar dwellings. Furthermore, it has removed a disgraceful smear east upon a certain American flag hanging in the doorway in an apartment house at Lynn, Massachusetts, and to the tenants who daily pass under that flag the liberty for which it stands has taken on a real meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Lupe Cabral Hopes to Walk</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">L</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">upe Cabral, the good wife of a man in California, and one of Jehovah’s witnesses, is laid up in a hospital in that state.' She is not able to walk, but her fellow patients find the way to her cot and she sends in work slips. With </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font8">package she said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I wish I could be walking around, and I know I could witness more, because I eould come to their beds and explain everything. We are not supposed to talk so much: but I am always praying that I will get to walk some day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Lupe first became ill she shed many tears, believing that for some reason or other she was being taken out of the Lord’s service; but those who were associated with her felt sure that the Lord would use her to His praise even in a hospital. Now, though she is flat on her back in a hospital, she has found a fellow publisher, who is also flat on her back, and who, in a letter just at hand, says, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have been here in bed two years, as of December 17, 1942. Lupie and I are both praying that we get up, that is, if it is Jehovah’s will. I have been studying my </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch towers</span><span class="font6"> and Lupie is studying the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> with me. There are so many things I have found out. The Lord was very gracious to ufe and I love Him so for bringing Lupie to me. Before Lupie came I was so hungry for the Bible. There are so many religions here that I did not know half of the time where I stood, so I kept praying with all my heart that the Lord would show me the right way and guide me. I wanted the real truth. I used even to cry about it, till all of a sudden the Lord put Lupie next to me; and when I saw her reading her Bible, and she told me she was of the truth, I knew right away that my prayers were answered. Isn’t it just wonderful? Now I pray the Lord to give me good understanding, so that when I am ready to leave here I will be able to give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">am so anxious. I just feel that I wish to tell everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nothing that ever happened to the pope or to his stooges and fellow assassins, Hitler, Mussolini, Laval, and Franco, can ever bring such joy to any of their hearts as has come to Ulis poor Lupie that is not even able to get up from on her back. What she has received from the Lord is worth more to her than all the gold that there is in Fort Knox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Who hath known the mind of- the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?” —Romans 11: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Tobacco Is Everywhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">N</span><span class="font8">OW the odor of stale tobacho rises rank and forbidding in every public place; hotels, trains and buses are foul with this slightly nauseating effluvium, and there is no more in the land a place whereinto the non-smoker may duck in an effort to escape. Tobacco is everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That it attacks the blood vascular system seems certain. Scattered through the pages of the scientific journals is plenty of evidence that it weakens the heart muscle by affecting adversely the small arteries that feed the great pump. Becoming smaller, they constrict the blood supply to the heart and thus begin the process that leads to missing beats and heart fatigue. This is not all. Spread throughout the blood system, tobacco or its extracts reduce the size of the arteries in general and, thus, tend to raise the blood pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another of its more sinister effects is that it produces a more profound reaction in young people than in the old. And, in the case of neurotics, it tends to exaggerate their jumpiness and increase their already embarrassing timidity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cases are cited upon the best evidence </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—-Journal of the American Medical Association^-oi</span><span class="font8"> the death of young children from swallowing a relatively small quantity of snuff, while one demise was reported from blowing bubbles through an old and ripe tobacco pipe. It need not, apparently, be taken by mouth to do its fell work. An enema in which a small quantity of tobacco had been boiled proved fatal to the unfortunate victim, and “There is enough poison in a cigar” (brand not stated) “to kill two grown persons if injected directly into the circulation,” another researcher states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So, there we are. Surely the above ought to be enough to banish smoking for ever from among us; but so perverse is human nature and so seductive the lure of our lady nicotine that more and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">/AUGUST 18, 1943</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">more the incense rises and greater and greater grow the tobacco fortunes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, of late years, alas, a new menace has arrived for those who find good cheer in the relaxing glow of a dime cigar or temporary dulling of taut . nerves in fretfully pecking nt the everpresent cigarette. Research along the line of toxicology has shown beyond a shadow of doubt that “all the tobacco in the American market contains arsenic in a form which may be taken up by the human body”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is news indeed. Head arsenate is used almost universally by those who grow tobacco, for the purpose of destroying the parasites which infest the leaf. The difficulty is that in the process of manufacture it cannot be eliminated, because it sticks to the plants. It cannot be washed off, for in doing so the tobacco is spoiled. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The United States department of agriculture published the results of an investigation in 1934 which stated that tobacco smoke contained arsenic. Consumer’s Research follow’ed later with an analysis of five brands of cigarettes. This report said that the amount of arsenic found was too high for the safety of the heavy smoker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is also plenty of evidence to show that itching, burning skin rashes sometimes afflict those who consume too much metallic poison with their tobacco. And, finally<sup>7</sup>, where patients are under treatment with arsenic compounds, the result of the addition of this substance by<sup>7</sup> way<sup>7</sup> of smoking can be grave indeed. —Hr. W^,A. Budden, in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The National Chiropractic Journal,</span><span class="font8"> September, 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Said King James of Smoking</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ “[It isj a custom loathsome to the eyes, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, and dangerous to the lungs. And the stinking black fume thereof nearest </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font8">sembles the horrid Stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jim hit it about right. The early colonists raised it and used it, but at one time both Massachusetts and Connecticut forbade the use of any not raised in the .. home state; it might be used only on t the advice of a physician; it might not be * used in any public place; it might not be used in 'one’s own home if more than one other person in the home was using it at the same time; it might not be used on Sunday; it might not b6 used within two miles of any church; it might not be used in fields or woods; it might not be used on a journey of less than five miles; and a fire for smoking might not be kindled with gunpowder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Your “Old Friend” Nicotine</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Even a drop placed on the eye of a sparrow or a white rabbit will kill the creature at once. According to one authority, the amount ^required to kill a good, stout horse is eight drops, and the action takes place in four minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, what is the effect upon the human system of the small amount of nicotine that is absorbed every time one smokes the ordinary cigar, cigarette or pipe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The effect is first upon the nerves, and through them, of course, upon the various organs and bodily processes. All experiments show conclusively that the effect is one of stimulation to the nerves, followed by depression. Nicotine differs from other strong drugs like morphine, heroin, and cocaine in this respect, in that it affects every nerve in the body; they affect the central nervous system only. Nicotine does affect the brain and spinal cord, but also the entire autonomic nervous system, which controls those vital operations of our organs that keep our bodies functioning properly.—Contributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Now It’s Niacin”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Under the heading “Now It’s Niacin” the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> January 20, 1942, sets forth that what was called “nicotinic acid” will hereafter be called “ni” for the nicotine, “ac” for the acid, and “in” for the vitamin, and that, forsooth, this is to allay the “unwarranted apprehension in the minds of the uninformed consumer”. The explanation says, unconvincingly, that this substance is “an invaluable member of the vitamin B complex” “and not nicotine”. But it doesn’t say it isn’t made from nicotine; and the dictionary does say that it is so made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Smoking Causes Cancer of the Lungs </span><span class="font8">♦ Alton Ochsler, M.D., and Michael Debakey, M.D., specializing in the treatment of cancer of the lungs in connection with the Tulane, New Orleans, La., University School of Medicine, looked for the causes of the great increase in this terrible malady and definitely located it in cigarette smoking. They found that every one of their lung cancer patients, except two women, were excessive smokers. People with lung cancer average. to live ten months after the diagnosis. Of course, you could have Ochsler and Debakey cut out your cancerous lung, if you prefer to keep on smoking. Their record is that after having your cancerous lung cut out you stand a 62-percent chance of living for one year, 38-percent for two years, 16-percent for three years, 14-percent for four years, and 8-percent for five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Cigarette Sent Down the Ship</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The visitor op the bridge dropped by for a chat and lit a cigarette. The submarine saw the rise and fall of the spot of red in the distance and identified it as a burning cigarette; it followed the ship for six hours, and, when dawn came, torpedoed it. This is the gist of a German broadcast, made after the submarine officers had questioned the survivors of the sunken vessel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Someone has well said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Let no one boast of being clean When he is full of nicotine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Inquisitive, Intelligent and Affectionate Elephant</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">B</span><span class="font8">URMA is a young lady elephant at the Bronx zoo, in New York city. She weighs only 1,774 pounds, is quite young, and has much to learn. Her bedroom is closed with doors 15 feet high, 5 inches thick, studded with iron and chained, Burma was not content. She wanted to be wise, like mother Eve. So Burma literally and actually poked her nose, i.e., her trunk, through the doors, when they closed sharply on it and she couldn’t pull it out. They had to give Burma a local anesthetic while they sewed and bandaged her trunk. She learned something from all this, and, like-some other girls, she knows by now that there are worse things for a girl than to remain quietly in her own home and not try to learn too much too soon about all the things that are in the world. The knowledge comes fast enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is admitted that in intelligence the elephant comes next to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Homo sapiens, </span><span class="font8">yourself. A church paper reports that two missionaries were traveling along an important .highway in Africa when they suddenly came 'across a herd of elephants that thought the highway was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">convenient path to where they wished to go. If men could build it, they would make use of it, in any event. It was night. No lights were on in the automobile. One of the herd investigated the machine and whisked off the horn with one swipe of his truftk. Then the herd drew to one side and the automobile continued on its way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elephants are very affectionate. Alice, the mate of Jumbo, loudly trumpeted her grief when she recognized the yards at St. Thomas, Ontario, where her companion was killed twenty-five years previously. That is longer than some humans remember their dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ At Basle, Switzerland, Nambo, the big boy elephant, missed Rudy, his dachshund playmate. Eor days he would not eat; tears trickled from his small eyes; he just stood swaying back and forth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 18,1M3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Rudy returned, Nambo gently stroked Rudy with his undulating trunk. Nambo weighs around 7,000 pounds. He eats 600 pounds of hay daily, with small quantities of sweet potatoes, rice and sugar cane, if he can get them. Also, and this to his discredit, he has learned to like tobacco, and searches the pockets of his keeper, looking for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Huntington, Indiana, the girl elephant Modoc ran away, and in five days her reducing exercises had cut down her weight by 800 pounds. The barking of a dog started her on the rampage in which she broke the neck of one man who •got in her way; and ran through a drugstore in which she had smelled roasted peanuts, and through the basement of a house, in which she overturned the furnace and ripped out some of the steam pipes. She was lured back into bondage again by a keeper who started out by throwing her ten loaves of bread. After you have lost 800 pounds, the sensation of eating ten loaves of bread* is very agreeable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elephants enjoy bathing far more than do some humans. They get a big kick out of splashing water on one another with their trunks. When they work at sawmills, rolling logs up to the saw, if the noon whistle blows they step aside and let the log that may be almost at the top cavort its way back into the pond. The elephant’s trunk is controlled by 40,000 strong muscles. Nq Creator, eh?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An elephant is only about three feet tall at birth, but he finally gets so big that the only way he can sleep in comfort is to lean against a tree. He can lie down, by stretching his legs backwards, but then he is helpless if attacked; so he usually sleeps standing up. How would you like to be so big that you would not dare to lie down?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Causes of Earthquakes</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Some of the causes of earthquakes are the falling of underwater cliffs into</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">27</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ocean beds, the collapse of caverns in mountainous areas, volcanic explosions caused by superheated steam, the pull of the planets at places where the earth’s crust is weak, and the shifting of air masses, and thus of weight, from one part of the earth to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Tendencies to Self-Destruction</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Bureau of the Census made a study of the 18,907 cases of suicide reported for the, year 1940. It found that males are three times as liable to suicide as females; that whites are four times as liable to suicide as colored; that the Chinese in America- are times as liable to suicide as the native Indians; and that April has the highest suicide level, and ■ January the lowest. Those between ages 45 and 54 are more liable to suicide than any others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Crime Center of the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ America is ashamed of the fact that she is the crime center of the world, with 36 times the homicide rate of either Britain or Germany, based on the population. The rate is ten times as bad as that of Japan, and three times as bad as Italy. The most criminal state is Florida, .where the police themselves have, in most places, no regard at all for any kind of law. The most criminal city is Nashville, Tenn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A Plucky Radio Repairman</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ At South Bend, Indiana, Charles Palmer, flat op his back in bed for the last two years, with arthritis, manages to repair about two radios per week, and put them in first-class condition. His father (he himself is 28) removes the chassis from the big cabinet models, so that he can get at them on the movable work bench arranged across his bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mental Unbalance</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Albert Deutsch, welfare editor of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">PM, </span><span class="font8">claims that one of every ten Americans suffers a mental breakdown and one of every twenty spends part of his life as a patient in a mental hospital. Of the insane, 98 percent are in public-owned institutions. Of these, 17 percent are cured, and 29 percent more are sufficiently improved that they can he sent home to their families. Half the hospital beds in the United States are occupied by mental patients, and 120,000 new patients are admitted annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Dehydration News</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Dehydration is definitely under way. The submarine forced the issue. More than 13 percent of all eggs produced in the United States in 1942 were reduced to &quot;egg ' powder. It takes three dozen fresh eggs to make one pound of egg powder. The egg-drying capacity is now 250,000,000 pounds a year. Working at full capacity they would dry 750,000,000 dozen eggs annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dehydrated meat is turned into flakes which, in an emergency, may be’eaten without preparation. With water added the meat can be made into meat loaves, stews, soups, patties, or any other ground-meat dish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dehydrated cheese is in a flour-like form which by the addition of water can be molded into a regular cheese. Powdered skim milk is now turned out at the rate of 500,000,000 pounds a year. Plants for the dehydration of sweet potatoes, onions, cabbage, carrots, beets and rutabagas have been constructed, and these and other foods are almost certain to be shipped everywhere soon in poVdered form. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Strip Mine Reforestry</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Around Terre Haute and Evansville, Indiana, are eight counties where coal is mined with a steam shovel. The earth which covers the coal, and which is from 25 to' 50 feet deep, has to be removed before the coal is reached. The result is. a series of ridges and little artificial lakes. The ridges are now being reforested and lumber crops will grow where once were fertile farms and later were mines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Presenting “This Gospel of the Kingdom”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19430818_files/g_E_19430818-4.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Relevancy</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ING SOLOMON, blessed by Jehovah with an abundance of wisdom,, said: &quot;Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. A fool also is full of words [multi-plieth words, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">margin}.”—</span><span class="font8">Ecclesiastes 10; 11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The noun &quot;babbler” as there used is indeed descriptive of a familiar character. A babbler is one who literally allows the words to run out of his mouth without purpose, meaning or objective, Such a one ‘darkens counsel by words without knowledge’. (Job 38:2) Rather than thinking that one will be ‘heard for his much speaking’, the wise speaker will confine himself to utterances that are pertinent and timely to the subject matter under discussion: he will speak words that are “in season”. (Isaiah 50:4) Babblers speak words, whether appropriate or not, and are offensive to God and intelligent men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If one is to be an approved Theocratic minister, if he hopes to properly present the Kingdom message to the people at their doors, if he is to conduct helpful back-calls and instructive book studies, he must give heed to the wise &quot;words spoken by King Solomon and avoid the blunder of babbling. To do this he must become a master of the ar( of relevancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Observing relevancy literally means the practice of speaking or writing w'ords directly bearing upon or pertaining to a specific and definite proposition. It may be likened to the straight highway over which all coherent speech must pass, not only in formal discourses before audiences, but in private conversation as well. The Only purpose of speech is to . convey thought to others, and each word or phrase or sentence must contribute toward that thought objective. The practice of so ordering one’s words that they form a straight highway to the thought or climax of a proposition is the art of relevancy. To be profitable the words and thoughts uttered must be relevant ■ to the matter under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first thing that one must do without fail is to set the objective; that is, have the thought to be conveyed clear in mind before he opens his mouth to speak. Technically speaking, the thought or objective is called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the proposition.</span><span class="font8"> Failing to set this desired destination before one starts down the “speech highway”, he will become hopelessly lost and sidetracked and he, much less his audience, will never arrive at the goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even though one has carefully determined the exact point he wishes to make, the task is not always easy. Many times a listener will inject a counter proposition into the middle of one’s argument, or raise a contentious question to stir up strife or sidetrack the persuader from the straight course he has set for his argument. It might even be a query that would ordinarily be proper, but perhaps irrelevant to the particular discussion. In either event, never stop to go into a consideration of side issues or irrelevancies, but tactfully brush them aside or postpone their discussion, and continue according to plan, maintaining relevancy. If one stops to answer and discuss matters raised by his listeners he will have yielded the floor and lost the mastery of the situation and in all probability will never reach his original destination; all because he did not insist upon keeping the discussion relevant. Remember, keep your own mind as well as the mind of your listener square in the center of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font8"> highway leading to * </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font8"> objective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Once the speaker has the general proposition or central thought in mind he is in position to pick out the route</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">he desires to follow. The first step, in this connection is probably the most important, because at this point irrelevancy is most likely to creep in to later disrupt the argument. That first step is a thorough analysis of the subject. Lay the whole subject bare. Go to the very heart of the matter and determine the fundamental principles upon which it is based. View it from every aspect, pro and con. Determine those things that are relevant and those that are irrelevant. This can be accomplished only by studying and thinking clearly and searchingly on the/proposition for yourself. To rely on the reasoning of another man, whose arguments you may have read, without proving it for yourself, is a mistake that will probably defeat your purpose in-the end. As soon as a speaker who has thus -failed to prepare begins to speak his mental lethargy is evident to his hearers, and all hopes of convincing them vanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If one has diligently analyzed his proposition, thinking it out, he will have gleaned many ideas, some more important than others. The selection of the ideas to be used must proceed with care. This, of course, will be influenced by the time element. Select the number of points that can be developed properly in the time allotted. A very common mistake with inexperienced, and sometimes experienced, speakers is to try to give a twenty-minute talk in five or ten minutes. Do not “cram” the talk, but recognize the time limitation and plan accordingly. Select the most important ideas, and only those ideas that will. ■ definitely put you nearer to the final objective. As each idea unfolds it should advance the listeners, in a straight march, step by step, nearer to the ultimate goal. Do not charge headlong with a rush of ideas in rapid succession, or the audience will be left stranded; but there is an art in steadily pushing ahead in a straight line of relevant argument until, at the end of the speech, the des</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">tination will have been reached by both speaker and listener. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As an aid to maintaining relevancy the speaker should keep the issue before the mind of the audience throughout the talk. He should make a conscious effort toward this end by the repetition of key words or phrases that throw attention to the central idea, constantly emphasizing and calling attention to it. This will help the speaker to hold contact with his audience and keep the main objective clearly before them and their attention focused upon it, and, hence, not permit their minds to wander into, irrelevant bypaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the climax of the argument has been reached, the speaker should be able to stand at his final destination with his audience and, in effect (by recapitulation or summary type conclusion), say to his listeners: “Look down that straight road to where we started. I have built a straight highway every inch of the way from there to where we now stand. You have followed because what has been' said is true and right, and it was proved to you as we traveled along. The route is plain and easily followed. I have thus established the thought I set out to convey to you.” Thus by the shunning of crossroads, side roads and detours, and sticking to the main highway previously decided upon, the speaker has advanced to. his destination and completed a successful argument because he insisted upon relevancy from both himself and his audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God has committed to His people the Kingdom truths. He has commissioned those representatives to bear such truths to others. He has put His words into their mouths, that the commission might be properly met by His witnesses. Such privileged Kingdom publishers should study and learn and use His words in presenting the gospel of the Kingdom. So doing, they will not be guilty of babbling, but will always speak of those things that are relevant ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to The Theocracy and of comfort to the people of good-will toward God. They will not be sidetracked by goat-like opposers. They will observe God’s command to preach, and, while so engaged, will not babble or “turn aside to the right hand or to the left” for irrelevancies. —Deuteronomy 5:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Paralyzed but Uses Typewriter </span><span class="font8">♦ Indianapolis has an enterprising boy, Edward Mattingly, who broke his neck by diving in shallow water, and thereafter was in a hospital for two years, emerging with useless .hands.

<p><span class="font8">♦ C. E. Wendel, retired Cincinnati patrolman, now in Mexico, can’t figure it out why the Good Samaritan Hospital, Cincinnati, let an 83-year-old woman (Mrs. Herrmann) with a fractured hip lie three days in their joint and it was not until she was moved to the Cincinnati General Hospital that her hip was set and efforts made to give her a chance of life. He asks the embarrassing question as to whether the Roman Catholic Good Samaritan Hospital believes in worshiping God or, instead, the dollar.</span></p>
