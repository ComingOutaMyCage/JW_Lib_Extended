<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth” of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom u ere of this u orld, then would mu servants fight.&quot;—John IS: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">JEHOVAH'S KINGDOM with his Son in the throne will be the Government of the New World. That Son, who has proved his love of righteousness and hatred of iniquity, will rule the earth from heaven, and therefore the promised world will be a world of righteousness. Being founded on righteousness and operating in harmony with the divine law, and being backed by the Almighty God. who is all-righteous, it will be a “world without end&quot;. Those who are accounted worthy to gain it by devoting themselves to the righteousness of God and who continue faithful will live in the new world and never see death. The King of the new world declared that he had nothing in common with the “prince of this world&quot; and therefore his kingdom could not be of this world. The establishment of the new world, therefore, means a fight, both in heaven and in earth. The world of darkness and wickedness and its prince must go; the world of light and righteousness and its Theocratic Government of Jehovah by his Son must come in, to abide forever. Under such righteous government the worship of Jehovah will alone obtain throughout the universe. It will be freely practiced on the earth without interference and opposition. All religious persecutors will have been destroyed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The enemy effort is to prevent earth's people from going over to the righteous new world of God's establishment. The malicious purpose of the “prince of this world’’ is, when he and his world go down, to pull down all the inhabiters of the earth with him. “Rule or ruin” is his selfish policy. To turn earth's peoples away from the righteous new world and to set them in opposition thereto the ‘ god of this world” uses deception and calls black white and white black. At the time of the end of his world, when he is cast out from his heavenly position and power, he is called “that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world”. (Rev. 12:9) Only those who come out from this present evil world and now take their stand on the side of the King of the new world shall escape the Old Serpent's deception. HL most effective and wih means of deception and ensnarement is lehgion. especially that form of religion which he palms off for Christianity,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> In his final deception of the world and in order to hold all parts thereof under his power he persuades the deceived leaders on earth to set up a world federation and to give religion the foremost part therein and to call this a “new world, created Inhuman hands”. Because religion is given its due place therein, the leaders and the masses are persuaded that it is a Christian “new order founded upon moral principles” and that it is the new world God promised. Under this religious deception main will fight for such “new order&quot; of the same old woild and will choose to abide under it until it cracks up at the battle of Armageddon. Then the blinded peoples who follow blind religious guides Mill together go down into the ditch of destruction with, the world of their choice and its prince.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The great King and Fitrhter for the nev world strongly warned of this great deception by lehgion. Concerning the years following the World War he said: “There shall arise false Christs, and fain-prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before &quot;&nbsp;(Matt. 24:24.25) The “abomination of desolation&quot;, which he mentioned just a few verses previous, is a wonder-working false Christ with many false prophets advocating it. It is an abomination to God, because it is a false or counterfeit theocracy and brazenly assumes to take the place of Jehovah's new world Government under Christ. It flies in the face of God by refusing the evidence that the old world has reached its end and the time for Jehovah's Rule by Christ is here. Desperately it strives to keep in operation man's rule under Satan by means of totalitarian regimentation as against Christ’s reign under the Most High God Jehovah. Therefore Jesus warned all persons of good-will toward God and his Kingdom to flee this world immediately on perceiving the formation of the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; and to seek refuge on the side of the Theocratic new world. But how, you ask. may the false Christs and false prophets be detected and their deception repulsed and killed? By testing their messages and claims in the licrht of Jehovah's Word concerning THE THEOCRACY.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The uncovering of the deceivers who oppose and fight against the new world under the cloak of religion is pictured in the final scenes of the prophetic drama of Jephthah. Such deceivers do not claim to be Nazis, Fascists, or totalitarians, and rather loudly profess to be religious, and hence mistake themselves for genuine Christians. Yet they fight against the Theocracy of the new world. In these deceptive times truth-seekers de.-ire to know how to determine what is God’s message and by whom it is delivered and what is the touchstone by which to safeguard oneself against deception. Such ones will study with deep seriousness the final part in Jephthah's career.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">STAB IX THE BACK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* The Ammonites violently encroached upon the domain of Jehovah’s typical Theociacy over Israel, and Jephthah had ju-t administered a crushing defeat to the aggressors. Thereby the Lord God caused his man of faith Jephthah to be confirmed as the head and captain over his people, particularly the Gileadites, or people of Gilead. After the campaign lephthah as God's visible representative took up residence in Gilead at Mizpah, which name means &quot;Watchtower&quot;. The heavy blow against the anti-Theocratic Ammonites vindicated God's name and kept open in Israel the worship of Jehovah and the operation of his Theocratic organization. It was a cause for rejoicing and thanksgiving by all Israel, and a reason to unite around the typical Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Westward across the Jordan river from Gilead lay the territory of the tribe of Ephraim, which vas a brother tribe of Manasseh, the tribe to which Jephthah belonged. The original Manasseh and Ephraim were sons of Joseph, born to him in Egypt. &quot;And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon. and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.” (Judg. 12: 1) At the time of the Ammonite incursion they not only broke into Gilead, but, says the record, &quot;the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.” (Judg. 10:9) The snarling question put to Jephthah was an open admission that the Ephraimites had not risen up under him to hurl the invaders back across the frontiers. This unjustified faultfinding by the Ephraimites occurred after Jephthah's home-coming in peace. Evidently it was while his daughter was away in the mountains for two months to prepare herself to be offered up as the &quot;burnt offering&quot; unto the Lord God in fulfillment of Jephthah's vow for victory.—Judg. 11: 34-39.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Jephthah’s campaign against land-grabbing demon-worshipers pictured the spiritual fight of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization under Christ Jesus the Head. It is to maintain Jehovah's worship and to carry on his “strange work” to the fini-li against the unwarranted limitations and encroachments by the totalitarian forces at this time. In the prophecy describing events at the time of the end Jesus foretold that at his coming to the temple for judgment of his professed followers he would find a faithful remnant. This remnant he would designate and appoint as the “faithful and wise servant” under him. To such servant class He would commit ‘ his goods”, or the Kingdom interests on earth. Thereby the “faithful and wise servant&quot; class would be the visible Theocratic organization on earth under Christ Jesus. Its work is to declare Jehovah's name throughout all the earth and to publish the good news of The Theocracy now established.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Furthermore, in the judgment at the temple he would come suddenly upon a selfish class of professed followers. They were indeed con-ecrated to the Lord God and begotten of his spirit, but had yielded to selfishness and were blinded to the Kingdom and became lawless. They then fight against their fellow servants, the faithful remnant. Hence they fight against the Theocratic organization and the Lord brands them as “that evil servant&quot;. He cuts them off asunder from his organization, and appoints them their portion with the anti-Kingdom crowd with whom they fight in common, namely, the hypocrites, the modern-day Ammonites. (See Matthew 24: 3. 14, 45-51.) Just as Ephraim was a brother tribe to Manasseh, so those of “that evil servant” claim to be spiritual brethren of the approved remnant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> During the eighteen years' oppression upon Israel by the Ammonites, the Ephraimites had subnutted to sucl. demon-worshipers as the higher powers and been contaminated with their religion. When the call to action came to overthrow the yoke of •he Ammonites and beat back their new aggressions, the Ephraimites willfully refused to fight under Jephthah along with his fellow tribesmen. Like conduct has been shown by the “evil servant&quot;, and the &quot;man of sin&quot; class of which he is a part, during the eighteen years from the Lord’s coming to the temple in 191S and down to 193G. Then came 1938. when the Lord God graciously revealed that his approved organization is Theocratic. Then the Theocratic rule was set up among his organized remnant or &quot;faithful and wise servant&quot; class, but the “evil -ervant&quot; stuck to their selfish independence, refusing to come under and submit to the rule of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Higher Powers&quot;, God Jehovah and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The evil Ephraimites looked upon Jephthah of Mizpeh merely as an individual, and not as the one de'ignated and backed up by Jehovah to be the “head and captain&quot;, the living symbol of the typical Theoc-tacy in Israel. Not seeing the organization, they made a personal attack upon him as a man. Before that, when tiling<sup>5</sup> looked so desperate that Jephthah made a special vow to Jehovah for victory, the Ephraimites did not join the fighting ranks. They felt unable to cross the Jordan river then. But now, when it came to venting a grudge against those blessed with victory from the Lord, they could go to the trouble of crossing Jordan and spoiling for a fight with their brethren. Now. after God had given the victory and they saw the result gained without their aid. they felt they had missed a chance to make a name for themselves and carry off some of the booty and glory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>I:</sup> The Ephraimites felt they must justify them-&gt;elve? in the eyes of all Israel: and so they worked up a false charge as an excuse for taking offense Tney did not discern that the battle wa- the Lord's and that He fought and gained the victory, and that human power and numbers were not the deciding factor. Feeling that they were the indispensable factor for any victory and that they should have been along as if being THE essential ones, they felt disgruntled at the ones who risked their necks in the time of danger. Herein they repeated the same complaint as tlieir forefathers did to Gideon over a hundred years before: “And the men of Ephraim -aid unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did ehide with him sharply.&quot; (Judg. 8:1) In Gideon’s day they did manage to get in on some of the final fighting, but here during Jephthah’s campaign against Ammon the Ephraimites missed out altogether. Therefore, although themselves to blame, they picked a quarrel with God's Theocratic representative. They were the very opposite of Jephthah’s daughter, who went out first to meet him with rejoicing over the victory. For her to do so meant thenceforth the separation of her from others to the exclusive, full-time service of the Lord God Almighty at his temple.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The maintenance of the worship of Jehovah in the earth, and the victory over the encroaching forces of demonism and totalitarianism, are not dependent upon any human creatures. Nor is any mere man, dead or alive, the head or leader of those who hold to Jehovah's approved organization. Christ Jesus, the Greater Jephthah. is their invisible and heavenly Head by God's appointment, and the Watch Tower Society under him follows the Theocratic rule and acts as his servant in behalf of all those today who choose Jehovah God and his new world. All personal selfish features have been removed from the Society of the Lord's “faithful and wise servant&quot; class. The “elective elder&quot; system of company rule has been cleared out; likewise the giving of worldly titles. Also the same service requirements have been applied to each and all as witnesses of Jehovah The Society has devoted itself entirely to the service of “the Higher Powers&quot; and to the Theocratic rule of organization and operation. For the vindication of Jehovah's name it has gone forward in his &quot;strange work&quot; against religion, proclaiming his name and kingdom and declaring hi&gt; vengeance against the modern Ammonites and all enemies, demon and human.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Tiiis course the Lord ha^ exceedingly bles-ed since 1938. The result of hm blessing is that the class of “other sheep&quot; pictured bv Jephthah’s daughter have come forth with rejoicing and yielded themselves over m consecration to the unceasing and lifelong service of Jehovah and hi- glorious Theocratic Government under Christ. By tin- manifest blessing of God Almighty in the face of increasing encroachment and opposition b) the religious-totalitarian crowd the Lord God lias unmistakably indicated which organization on earth is the visible part of his Theocratic organization under Christ and which is his “faithful and wise servant&quot; class on earth to whom the King at the temple ha.- entrusted the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> The attitude of the “evil servant&quot; and the rest of the “man of sin&quot; class at this favor of God on his Theocratic organization is like that of the Jewish </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">13 What must be said concerning the depending of wor«hij‘ victor* and leadership upon hutnnu creature'-, anti how have the Lord*- ‘servant’ class been cleansed of personal seltish features, for the sake of Theocratic service’*</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">15 Hoti is the attitude of the entire &quot;man of sin” clac* like ihat of the ,ciergv at Jesus’ prosperity and wbv do the* now gnash with their teeth at the faithful remnant as Jesu^ foretold'' </span><span class="font4">religious leaders at Jesus' prosperity, saying: “What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. If we’let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans [totalitarians] shall come and take away both our place and nation. ... it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.’’ “The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold, the world is gone after him.&quot; (John 11:47-50; 12:19) The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were together a typical representation of the great Theocracy of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus. The “evil servant&quot; and the “man of sin&quot; crowd claim to be in line for that kingdom and hence to be children of that kingdom. But, whereas God's Kingdom favors and privileges are openly bestowed upon the &quot;faithful and wise servant&quot; class, the religionists have missed out altogether, as Jesus foretold to the religious leaders, saving: &quot;Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ' (Matt. S: 11, 12) &quot;When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying. Lord. Lord, open unto us: and he shall answer and say unto you. I know you not whence ye are: . . . depart from me. all ye workers of iniquity.” I Luke 13 : 25-29) So they gnash with their teeth at the faithful remnant.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> The Ephraimites threatened to report to mob action. They threw Theocratic rule to the winds, and refused to consider the evidence proving that Jehovah chose Jephthah as his visible servant and judge of his covenant people. They threatened to take the law into their own hand-, and bring fiery destruction upon Jephthah and his house, thus to do what the Ammonites had wanted to do to him and Israel. They thus put themselves in the same class as the Ammonites, as opponents of God's typical organization. Likewise the religionists in the United States worked their schemes right in with those of the totalitarian &quot;Ammonites&quot; who are out for world domination. Beginning at the time of the Nazis' lightning-war push through Europe in 1940. with sure victory apparently in sight, and also timing it with, the harmful Flag Salute decision of the Supreme Court in June that year, Catholic Action raised up great mob violence against Jehovah’s remnant of witnesses. They tried to Tiurn the house down upon them’, and actually did burn the homes and property of many of Jehovah’s servants because these stood by the worship of the true God and published Ins kingdom. Amid the raging persecution the “evil servant&quot; class shielded itself from persecution, but turned Jehovah's witnesses over to the “Ammonites&quot;. In their publication the &quot;evil servant&quot; admitted past connections with the Watch Tower Society, but now had no connections whatsoever with Jehovah’s witnesses nor with the Theocratic organization, which organization they said was the ambitious idea of the man who was then the Watch Tower president. They were very careful to avow that they recognized the modern Ammonites as the “liigher powers&quot; ordained of God. This open statement in their publication the “evil servant&quot; released to all newspapers of the world, many of which published the same.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1T</sup> At the same time men who had not long previously been high in the inner councils of the Society, but who pursued an ambitious course and became unfaithful and quit, joined in the concerted attempt at ‘house-burning’ upon the organization. They set m motion costly legal actions to damage financially and otherwise the Society. This was done in contempt of Jehovah’s Theocracy and to bring great reproach upon his name and, by wrecking the organization, to break up His “strange work&quot; by his covenant people against religion. And in Canada the justice minister of that Dominion, a Quebec-Roman Catholic, chose the Fourth of July to declare the Watch Tower Society an &quot;illegal organization&quot;, to be forthwith suppressed; but the “evil servant” cla^s who disavowed all connections were given a clear right of way to carry on their activities. (Matt. 24: 9-13) Regardless of the Christian professions of all such “workers of iniquity&quot;, their effort was all part of the demons’ scheme for world domination by mean&lt; of the religious-totalitarian Ammonites of this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SELF-DEFENSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The Ephraimites proved themselves liars in the light of the actual facts. “And Jephthah .-aid unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.&quot; (Judg. 12:2) Ephraim was an inland tribe, but the Gileadites under Jephthah, being eastern-border tribesmen alongside Ammon, were the ones who were putting up the front-line fight against the Ammonite aggressions upon Jehovah’s worship in his typical Theocracy. &quot;Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them.” (Judg. 11: 11) Jephthah and his people, therefore, pictured Christ Jesus and his followers on earth </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">17 How did ambitious men once hlch in the SncietW Inn^r mnniih join in with the attempted ‘house-burning . and how did the Dominion's ministry of justice distriminate in favor of the evil -ervant &lt;&nbsp;hiss’ 18 la) How did Jephthah prove the Ephraimites were untrue' ibi Whnrn do Jephthah and his people picture today, and whj have these been more than ever the targets of the demons and forces under them’ </span><span class="font4">who line up with the Head and Chief of God's organization and who subject themselves to its Theocratic rule, particularly from 193S onward. Since then they have more than ever been the target of the demons under Satan. The religious-totalitarian forces, incited by the demons, have greatly afflicted Jehovah’s people for not putting the State higher than Jehovah in their worship and service toward Him. The totalitarian Roman Catholic Hierarchy has led in this assault upon His witnesses, because these expose the Nazis and Fascists and their religious ‘‘Fifth Column” and refuse to do obeisance to or ascribe salvation and protection to men or human organizations and creations, but only to God Almighty and his Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Ephraimites of old did not answer the call to engage in united action and volunteer to cross the Jordan and go to the help of their brother Israelites. They were unwilling to expose themselves to danger on the field of battle in behalf of the vindication of God's name. They looked at personalities and refused to come under headship and captaincy of any person they did not like or who stood in the way of their ambitions. Being the dominant tribe in Israel, they wanted to be commanders themselves rather than humble themselves under God's mighty hand of Theocratic rule as exercised through one of a lesser tribe. Selfishness caused them to turn down a great privilege.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Through former association with Jehovah's witnesses the modern Ephraimites of the “evil servant&quot; class have felt the heat of the affliction. They have felt uncomfortable and uncertain of their own freedom from persecution. Otherwise, why did they compromise with modern Ammon and publicly disclaim any ties and sympathy with Jehovah's witnesses! Why did they then express their willingness to ape the ways of the world toward creature emblems and I’.ail the modern Ammonites as the &quot;higher powers&quot; and refrain from declaring the day of Jehovah's vengeance against Satan's organization? Those of-the “evil servant&quot; and other members of the &quot;man of sin&quot; class cannot say they received no battle call against the &quot;Ammonites”. The call has not gone to any class or religious organization as such, but any individual in such class or organization had the privilege of responding thereto.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Ever since the Lord’s rule was put in force in October, 193S, the Society under Christ Jesus, in its assemblies and publications, has sent forth the call for more pioneer publishers and more company publishers. Any persons of good-will who saw the great issue involved and who desired to uphold the worship of Jehovah and the honor of his name had the privilege of responding and volunteering for service under the Theocratic organization. But the “evil servant&quot; class and the other religionists who claim to be spiritual Israelites ignored the invitation. Neither sympathy nor a word of defense did they offer in behalf of Jehovah's persecuted covenant people. They disclaimed any bonds and any agreement with the message and Kingdom position of Jehovah's witnesses. This they did to shield themselves and justify themselves before Satan's world. They did not cross the “Jordan”, that is, the peoples alienated from God and rushing down to the &quot;Dead sea”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The Divine Record, at Hebrews 11:32, lists Jephthah among God's ancient witnesses of outstanding faith in Him. Just why appears from Jephthah's further words to the Ephraimites: &quot;And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this- day, to fight against me?&quot; (Judg. 12:3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Kei. T’er.) </span><span class="font4">Jephthah's experience bears out that delivoiance. salvation, and preservation of pure and undefiled worship will never come through or in connection with the &quot;evil servant&quot; and other religionists of the &quot;man of sin&quot; class. The newspapers, conceal the tact that Jehovah's witnesses in Continental Europe have stood up against the Nazi </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fuehrer</span><span class="font4"> since his concordat with the Vatican in 1933 and have suffered unusual mistreatment in torture chambers and concentration camps therefor. Recently, since the Nazi-Fa&lt;eist-1 atican aggressions for world domination have stirred up the democratic nations to violent opposition, the newspapers pander to the religionist'- and, for propaganda purposes, play up reports of religious clergymen protesting to the Nazi leader over various points of difference. Examination of the news shows that all their protests never touch the real issue of man rule under the &quot;god of this world’’ as against the Theocratic rule of Christ Jesus under the ilost High God Jehovah; and never once in all the years have those clergymen protested against the brutalities and religious intolerance and persecution carried on by the religious-totalitarian combine against Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The tribe of Ephraim was the most populous and had numbers to offer for the war, but they failed to enlist on the side of The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">23 What did Jehovah’s victory through Jephthah demonstrate to populous Ephraim'<sup>2</sup> and how will th&lt; like thing be tn&gt;p revpectinc &quot;Christendoms” many religionist* and their &quot;New World order” 'beast”<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord to save by many or by few”. (1 Sam. 14: G) Likewise the hundreds of millions of‘’Christendom's” religionists, including the &quot;evil servant”, offer no hope of deliverance from the totalitarian monstrosity or &quot;beast”. The prophecy shows that in the so-called &quot;New World order” they will ride the “beast” and turn its seven heads and ten horns against The Theocracy and those who worship Jehovah and his King. Jehovah does not need religion's millions in order to uphold his worship and to deliver and save those who worship him in spirit and in truth. Such belief Jephthah had to exercise with strong faith in Almighty God: for he did not have great numbers in his army to depend upon, neither enough equipment to meet the Ammonites on equal terms. This faith-testing situation doubtless is what stirred Jephthah to utter his vow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup>‘ Suchlike faith, that overcomes the world, the remnant and their &quot;other sheep” companions must exercise, and they must serve God with no fear of death or fear of those who can cause death to the body, but not to the soul or right to future life. (Matt. 10: 26, 2S) The Greater Jephthah once put his earthly life in his hand. So now when wot Id totalitarianism is on the march those who stand by the worship and service of Jehovah mu*t do likewise, by uncompro-inisinglv advocating God's rule as against demon rule. The rabid persecutions from and after 1940 demonstrate that they are doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> For his own name's sake and in full agreement with Jephthahs vow Jehovah delivered the anti-Theocratic aggressors into Jephthah’s hand. Jephthah therefore never took the credit, but ascribed the salvation and deliverance to Jehovah God and proclaimed the vindication of His name. In like manner Almighty God has delivered over the modern Ammonites into the hand of hi* Greater Jephthah and the Theociatie organization under Him. There is not the barest chance that Theocracy and worship of Jehovah will succumb to demon rule. To this late day the religious-totalitarian might has failed in the conspiracy to overthrow Jehovah's witnesses. By faith these have triumphed over demonism and maintained their integrity toward God and continued &quot;blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ”. (1 Cor. 1:8,9) The visible part of the Theocratic organization still lives and is intensely active, notwithstanding world opposition. God's grace suffices them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BATTLE AGAINST DISRUPTIVE FORCES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Jephthah’s explanation did not check the Ephraiinites from proceeding with the determination</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to fight and carry out their threat. “Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said. Ye Gileadites are fugitive* of Ephraim among the Ephraiinites, and among the Manassites.” (Judg. 12:4) The Greater Jephthah has also accepted the challenge and gathered the advocates of Theocracy together. The opposition of the “evil servant” in trying to disrupt the Theocratic organization impels the faithful remnant and their companions to draw still closer together and also to bring in still more publishers for advertising God's name and kingdom. They carry on no direct controversy or argumentation with the “evil servant” in the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or other publication. In the spirit of the Lord and with the means He has provided they fight against the disruptive and destructive efforts of the “man of sin” companv. —2 Thess. 2:1-12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The fight today for united service of Jehovah in worship of him is not waged with carnal weapons. It is fought with the instruments of the truth concerning The Theocratic Government and its rule. Such weapons are symbolized by those with which the Gileadites battled the Ephraiinites. The armies of Ephraim crossed over to the east bank of Jordan and invaded the land of Gilead. Straight Ammonite procedure that was. The invasion by those offended, self-conceited, presumptuous, lawless Ephrainnte* was really a challenge to Jehovah, because he liad appointed Jephthah as judge and deliverer of Israel. It was a move against the restoration of Theocratic rule. It was a taking up of the fight of the defeated Ammonites. The Ephraiinites were now on the move to depose and destroy the Gileadite Jcplitliah and to take for themselves the dominant leading role in Israel's affairs. Such has been the covert ambition of the “evil servant” class. They have aimed to gra*p the reins of control of the Society out of the hand?, as they thought, of a man. but in reality out of the hands of the invisible Head and Leader. Christ Jesus, the Greater Jephthah. It is perfectly understandable, therefore, why the “evil servant&quot; da** have said that “the president [now deceased] of the Watch Tower Society set up his own theociatie government'’. Such foul charge is the j-ame as that of the officials of Harlan County, Kentucky, and of Connersville, Indiana, and of other modern Ammonites, to wit, that ‘Jehovah’s witnesses under Rutherfoid are scheming to set up their own theocracy'. The testimony offered in the courts, and the decisions of federal and state supreme court judges, exploded such demoniacal false charges, in 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">27 (a) What Gid the battle weapons symbolize and what was the red nature or meaning of the mote of the CphrnimiteM against Jeph'h ih in Gilead<sup>9</sup> (b&gt; Bj ’juch move what covert ambition of the “evil servant” class was pictured, id agreement with their false charges •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> The “men of Gilead&quot; of today under the Greater Jephthah fight with the “sword of the spirit, which is the word of God&quot;, and especially that part of God’s Word concerning Theocratic rule and organization. The Ephraimite “man of sin&quot; class make a show of using the same “sword&quot; against the faithful remnant, just as Satan used Scripture texts against Jesus during his forty-day temptation in the wilderness. Actually, however, these “Ephraimites&quot; use principally the writings of a man dead since 1916 and whom they profess to follow, or use the traditions of the fathers of the religious organizations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> The Ephraimites falsely charged Jephthah and his men of Gilead, saying: “Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.” (An;. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> In so doing the Ephraimites ignored the facts as stated by Moses, at Numbers 32: 33, 39, 40 and Deuteronomy 3:15. Their charge may have been a “dirty dig&quot; at Jephthah because he had once been driven out and had to flee to the land of Tob, where empty-handed, unemployed men from various tribes went and joined him in his exploits of faith. This was a foregleam of how today the religionists of &quot;Christendom&quot; speak of Jehovah’s witnesses as “fugitives&quot; from “organized religion&quot; and wickedly charge them with being Communists, reds, anti-God, fifth columnists, and subversive elements of potential danger to the state.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Also the “evil servant&quot; class claim that the Watch Tower Society has become a “fugitive&quot; from the teachings of the dead man whom they profess to follow. They try to curry favor with the political element to whom they do obeisance as the “higher powers&quot; and say that Jehovah’s witnesses are suffering persecution for their own wrong course of action. Hence they offer no pity or sympathy for Jehovah's -ervants in their hard sufferings. Thus the “evil servant&quot; class do as Jesus foretold of them, ‘smite their fellowservants' and &quot;eat and drink with the drunken” of &quot;Christendom”. (Matt. 24: 48-51) In disowning any ielationship and in being ashamed of Christ's body members who undergo public reproach, the “evil servant&quot; class show shame for Christ Jesus himself, who said: “Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” (Mark S:3S) The facts are that modern Ephraimites are the “fugitives&quot; and have gone out from the Theocratic organization. —See 1 John 2: IS, 19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TOUCHSTONE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> “And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said. Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him. Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said. Nay; then said they unto him. Say now Shibboleth.” ^Judg. 12:5,6) Those Ephraimites were in the same position as the Moabites were after Judge Ehud plunged the dagger into the belly of their fat lung, Eglon. Thereupon Ehud said to his warriors: &quot;Follow after me: for the Lord hath delivered your enemies into your hand.” “And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over. And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.&quot;—Judg. 3: 28. 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> Jordan’s passages or fords symbolize ways and means for the “man of sin” class to justify themselves before worldly men for their attack upon the Theocratic organization of the Greater Jephthah. They would use those as avenues of escape from the disastrous consequence of their act, namely, the execution of the adverse judgments of God again-t them, appointing them to their place with the religious hypocrites and all others of Satan's world. However, Jehovah through his Word has revealed his Theocratic organization under Christ Jesus. As Jehovah's mouthpiece Je&lt;u- interprets the prophetic Scriptures. He allows the &quot;evil servant&quot; and fellow religionists no scripture in defense of themselves and their misconduct. By the very Scriptures he blocks up all their attempts to get away by their own human interpretations and constructions upon God's written Word. Jehovah’s witnesses take the divine interpretation of His Word and are thereby fortified and in the position to anticipate the ‘ man of sin&quot; class. The way of escape from the judgments written in God's Word is thus blocked, winch judgments Hb witnesses must declare against the unfaithful class. —I’s. 149: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> The “man of sin&quot; class on the run savs. in substance : “Spare me. Do not apply to me the judgments written in the Word of God. Do not hold up my course of antagonism to The Theocracy in the Watch Tower publications, to show how the Scriptures condemn such action. Do not apply against nn disruptive work the Bible instruction: ‘Mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.’ (Rom. 16: 17. 18) </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">31 What did the Gileadites then seize to cut off the e*rape of the Ephraimites and how was a like maneuver executed ir Ehud’' di\ ‘ 32 What do the * passages of Jordan’ Fvmbohze. and how are such cut off or blocked to tho-e who now trj to escape therebj •</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">33 How does the “man of rid&quot; class on the run ask to be spared bj those under the Greater Jephthah*&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And, ‘If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for lie that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.’ (2 John 10,11) Rather, let's talk about God's love, and not his judgments. Let’s develop ripe character and follow the ‘good neighbor<sup>-</sup> policy with religion and get ready to go to heaven.<sup>-</sup>’ But does this religious argument work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> In 191S Christ Jesus came to the temple and began judgment at the house of God. (1 Pet. 4: 17) He requires every one to identify himself in accord with this rule : “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” (Matt. 12: 30) To those who try to justify and suit themselves by self-interpretations of Scripture, to escape the “judgment written<sup>-</sup>’, the question is put: ‘Are you one of those Ephraimites that profess to be of the covenant people of God. but at the same time fight against Jehovah’s Theocratic organization under Christ and against his “faithful and wise servant&quot; class? Are you one of those belonging on the other side of the river, fighting us as the demonworshiping &quot;Ammonites<sup>--</sup> do and refusing to recognize Jehovah’s Judge at the temple and his Theocratic Government and its rule’’ The religionists answer such question. &quot;Nay,” meaning to deceive and to cover over inward hostility to God's faithful ones. This is a subterfuge to get away with their &quot;inside job” and thus be able to cause more disturbance to the injury and hindrance of the ones trying to maintain their integrity by keeping covenant with God. Those who become ensnared with religion and turn against the Watch Tower Society and criticize and oppose it deny stoutly they are of the “evil servant” class or are in line for that class and will shortly land in it. They smile and smirk at suggestions of such outcome to themselves, and say, ‘Nay; we are not on the enemy s side.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> The touchstone is symbolized by the test-word &quot;Shibboleth”. This word means something growing up or flowing forth, as an “ear of corn&quot; or a &quot;flood&quot;. It is so used at Genesis 41 : 5-7, Ruth 2: 2. and Psalm 69:2.15. The Lord God has graciously sent to his faithful remnant and their companions abundant stores of “ears of corn’’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(shibboleth),</span><span class="font4"> the spiritual food to offset any famine. “He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.’’ (Ps. 147: 14) Also he causes the stream and “flood’’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(shibboleth)</span><span class="font4"> of his righteous judgments to flow forth from the temple, but these do not overflow and drown the faithful remnant, but do proceed against the unfaithful and wicked, as at Barak's battle at Megiddo and David’s battle at Mount Perazim —Judg. 5:19-21; 2 Sam. 5: 17-21 ; Isa. 59: 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>36</sup> Hence those holding to The Theocracy ask the pretenders and deceivers that claim to abide by the Bible, What kind of language do you speak? How do you pronounce the “present truth’’, the up-to-date spiritual food of the Lord? How do you pronounce the judgments of the Lord against the enemy? Such test-questions are to make them show whether they speak the “pure language’’, free from all religion, and in line with God's judgments against religion, but in support of The Theocracy and its vindication of God's name. If they are antitypical Gileadites under the Greater Jephthah and advocating The Theocracy, they will pronounce these things of the Lord aright, and not in disagreement, according to their own sectarian style.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> “Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said, Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right.” (Judg. 12:6) The Ephrainnte way of pronouncing the test-word differed from Jephthah’s, although sounding very, very similar. Nowadays the “evil servant&quot; class have a form of Bible teaching. Those who are not instructed by the great Teachers, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, miirht think it sounds the same and is the same as that of God's organization. The pope in his encyclicals quotes some scriptures, and the clergymen who are reported protesting to the Nazis also quote some scriptures scriptures which also Jehovah’s witnesses have used and do use in standing up against all totalitarians. But there is a difference in the purpose of quotation and the difficulties causing the quotation. The ([notation by the clergy is to use God’s Woid as a shield for religious practice; the quotation by the witne-ses is in behalf of The Theocracy and the maintenance of Jehovah’s worship on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> The clergy way of pronouncing is not in harmony with the teaching of God's Word concerning hi.-Righteous Government of the new world; otherwise, they would be in unity with His people in the Theocratic organization and ‘seeing eye to eye' and -peaking the same message. But the peculiar teaching and message of religionists lacks something, just as “Sibboleth&quot; lacked something that “Shibboleth&quot; had. “Thy speech bewrayeth thee.’ (Matt. 26:73) No difference may be allowed to pass. Said the apostle Paul: “But there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we. or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you. let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">36 What test-questions do those for The Theocracy ask the deceivers and whr<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">37 How did the Ephrnimnes pronounce the test-word and how does this illustrate the close likeness with vet h difference between The pr&gt;&gt;n&lt;&gt;un&lt; e ments of the pope and other clergy and those of Jehoxnhs witnesses<sup>9 </sup>38 Is the clergy way of pronouncing the menage right and complete'<sup>4 </sup>and &quot;hat does the apostle Paul say about letting any difference pass without objection<sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font4">again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed,” —Gal. 1:7-9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s9</sup> The Ephraimite fugitive was “not prepared to speak right”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Young’s)</span><span class="font4"> Neither is the “evil servant” so prepared. To such the promise of Zephaniah 3: 9 has not been fulfilled: “For then will I turn to the people a pure language </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[(Hebrew)</span><span class="font4"> a pure lip], that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.” They may pronounce the words “Theocracy”, “the present truth,” “redemption,&quot; “salvation,” “restitution,” and “higher powers”, but the meaning that the “evil servant” class give to these words lacks the advanced light on Bible truth since the death of their professed leader in 1916. The meaning they give is marked by honor to human creatures, by “character development”, by traditions and religious formalities, and by a compromising “respectable appearance” before the world. Hence they cannot “speak right” the Bible truths according to what the Theocratic organization and rule under Christ require.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> This inability betrays them as being separatists, opposers and members of the “man of sin” class. (2 Thess. 2:3-12) They do not have the “pure lip” with which to call upon the name of the Lord to serve him in common consent with the remnant and their companions. Hence they are at odds with the &quot;faithful and wise servant” class. They not only do not speak the Theocratic language of the faithful, but cast slurs at the Scriptural organization of Jehovah's servants to misrepresent it and its purpose and work. They speak “good words and fair speeches” indeed, but to “deceive the hearts of the simple”. (Rom. 16:17,18) They talk sentimentally of the love of God. They affect gentleness and accordingly soft-pedal the hard message of the “day of vengeance of our God&quot;. Their pronouncing of sibboleth” is softer than the thicker, harsher “SHibboleth”. It is a “dead give-away&quot;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> How does the Greater Jephthah handle such? Judges 12:6 reads: “Then they took him, and slew him at the passages [fords] of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.&quot; No “good neighbor&quot; policy was shown. Those Ephraimites were covenant-breakers toward God, and “covenant-breakers . . . are worthy of death”. (Rom. 1: 31, 32) Those holding to the Theocratic organization must vigorously apply the “sword of the spirit” against all those of the “man of sin” crowd in order to slay or kill their power and influence with respect to the unsuspecting ones It is dangerous to allow free passage to any of that crowd, as further trouble is sure to follow within the ranks of those in the Theocratic organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> Such use of the “sword&quot; to cut off deceitful workers is in agreement with the action of the Greater Jephthah after his coming to the temple. Concerning that “evil servant&quot; crowd he said: “The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth [against the ‘faithful and wise servant' class].” (Matt. 24:50,51) “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 13:41,42) The faithful remnant and their beloved companions have a part in this fight against the religious influence of the ' evil servant&quot; and all others of the “man of sin” company. Hence they must be on the alert and sharp of ear to discern the difference of religion's message from the &quot;gospel of the kingdom”. They must try the spirits whether they be of God the Theoerat or of antichrist.—1 John 4:1-6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VICTORY FOR NEW V ORLD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> A sizable army of Ephraimites, at lea&lt;t forty-two thousand, had crossed the Jordan and attacked those who rallied to Jehovah's judge, Jephthah. Not one of those disturbers of unity and assailants of Theocracy escaped the execution of the adverse judgment of God as carried out by his .indue and fellow warriors. They wore wiped out just the snnc as had been the Ammonites. Their being Ephraimites, hence Israelites, made them more eondemnabb- than the Ammonites. Jehovah did not spare such Lrael-ites of Ephraim any more than the prophet Ezekiel'' wife was spared because she vas married to the prophet of Jehovah. (Ezek. 24: 15-18) Like Ezekiel at his wife's death, the Gileadites did not mourn the death of those executed Ephraimites. The other Ephraimites that remained on the other side of the river but had sent across and backed up the 42.00b of their representative tribesmen doubtless indulged in weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth at God's execution of judgment upon their fighters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>44</sup> It is no different now, when any professed spiritual Israelite goes over to the “evil servant” class and fights against the Theocratic organization and rule</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">42 How is such use of the “sword” in agreement vxith the action of the Greater Jephthah after coming to the temple’ and what therefore, must the remnant and companion's be on the alert to detect • 43 How man\ Ephraimites fell in death, and whv did not the Gileadite* mourn the death of such’</span></p>

Not a single such rebel can or will escape the certain judgment of the Lord, which judgment he now causes to be declared through his earthly visible part of his Theocratic organization under Christ. Neither do any of the faithful advocates of His Righteous Government mourn that such rebellious ones are cut off from the organization and come under the judgment of the second death thereby.—Hei). 10:2G-31.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> “And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.<sup>-</sup>’ (Judg. 12:7) During those few years Jephthah came in touch with his daughter, whom his fervent vow had dedicated to the full-time service of Jehovah God at his tabernacle in Shiloh across the river. In obedience to the Theocratic law upon the nation Jephthah regularly attended the appointed feasts there. He and his daughter were both faithful to the vow unto the Most High God and its obligation upon both of them. They thereby displayed faith, and were Jehovah’s witnesses, maintaining integrity toward Him. Her presence and zealous service at the tabernacle were a continual memorial to the vindication of the name of Him who granted the victory to Jephthah over the Ammonites.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>46</sup> Also, four days in each year, the virgin daughters of Israel went to see her. to praise the Lord with her over his victory for Theocracy and for </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">45 [‘‘urine the vears That Jephthah judged Hrael what eontpct did he hue wrh hi- daughter, and what cuur-c did both or them follow ti&gt;w,n I Jehovah'*</span></p></li></ul>

These daughters of Israel would continue to follow this course after her father had passed and was succeeded by the next judge whom Jehovah raised up. (Judg. 12: S-15) AH that Jephthah left behind him of his offspring was wholly devoted to Jehovah and his service as lone as her life lasted. In his devoted daughter Jephthah left behind a monument on earth testifying to Jehovah’s triumph through the faith and devotion of those who held fast to his Theocracy and to his faithful worship and service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>47</sup> The Greater Jephthah and Jehovah’s Theocratic organization under him will never pass away, but will triumph completely at the battle of Armageddon and endure forever in the “world without end , wherein dwells righteousness to the everlasting glory of Jehovah God. The eventual passing off the earthly scene of the faithful remnant who have fought under the Greater Jephthah against the religious-totalitarian powers of this world will mean their union with Him in heavenly glory, honor and immortality. (Rom. 2:7) &quot;With their passing the pure worship of Jehovah shall not vanish from the earth, but they will leave behind the “princes in all the earth”, including the resurrected Jephthah himself, and the faithful devoted “great multitude&quot;.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>KINGDOM INTERESTS FIRST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far count!}, w ho called his own sere ants, and delivered unto them his goods And unto one he gave five talents, to another two. and to another one, to every man according to his seieral ability; and straight-wax- took ms journey &quot;&nbsp;So said Jesus, at Matthew 25. 14. 15. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tal&lt; nts</span><span class="font3"> is a term used concerning money, a talent being estimated to be worth somewhere between $700 and $2,250 or £140 and £560, and hence being a measure of value or a valuable thing. The “talents” belonged to the Lord of the kingdom of heaven and therefore represented his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">interests</span><span class="font3"> m God’s kingdom “His goods,’’ which included those talents, likewise represent the Kingdom interests, the entire Kingdom interests of the Lord on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What, then, is meant by the Lord’s expression, “to every man according to his several ability’’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 Ability</span><span class="font3"> means power, capacity, efficiency, or quality of being able. It will not do to view this matter from the human standpoint, because human ability means physical and mental strength, education, money, influence, such being ofttirms aceompann■! by a great deal of bluff and self-tmpoi t.n:i e Sin eh such is not valuable in the Lord’s sight The wrong thong’it Satan has put into the minds of the religious clergy and made them believe they are about the only ones that should exei expect to shine in the Lord’s kingdom, and they base thur conclusion upon the fact of their great learning and ability to sway the people</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Looked at from the divine viewpoint, Jesus possessed the greatest ability of am one ever on earth His ability did not consist of physical strength and a collegiate education , for he did not use his physical strength particularly, nor did he ever attend a theological school To him Jehovah committed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> Kingdom interests Of what, then, did the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ability</span><span class="font3"> of Jesus consist? This- </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">His absolute, complete devotion to the Father's teill; his complete loyalty to God Almighty.</span><span class="font3"> This finds expression in his words “Lo, I come in the volume of the book it is written of me, 1 delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40: 7, 8: Ileb. 10: 7-10) Jesus’ capacity was complete. Therefore Jehovah filled him with his spirit in the complete sense, and he proved his loyalty to Jehovah to the utmost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Greek Bible word translated &quot;'ability” is drawn from the root verb used in the text where Jesus spoke to his apostles in answer to a request that they have certain positions in his kingdom, and he said- </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Are</span><span class="font3"> ye </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">able</span><span class="font3"> to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” “They say unto him, We </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">are able.&quot;</span><span class="font3"> (Matt. 20: 22) Hence the correct definition of his words “several ability” is this: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Complete consecration to the Lord God and a joyful submission to Ihs holy will; a loyal devotion to the Lord God even unto death.</span><span class="font3"> Such </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ability</span><span class="font3"> or capacity increases the more one is filled with the spirit or invisible power of the Lord The apostle Paul, in speaking about redeeming the time by faithful service to the Lord, said: “Be filled with the spirit”, thus increasing one’s ability or capacity. (Eph. 5:16-18) In the proportion that one has the spirit of the Lord, in that proportion he possesses power or ability for good—See Bomans 1.16 and 1 Thessalonians 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The spirit of the Lord does not consist of sanctimonious piety nor an outward expression of being ‘ more holy than thou&quot;, which, is m fact hypocrisy. Having the spirit of Cm 1st means to be absolutely loyal to Jehovah God and to the Lord Jesus, to be completely devoted to the Lord and his cause, and to do the Lord's service according to the Lord's way. It means leaving self entirely out of sight and looking only to the Lord's interests The Jewish Pharisees could not be used by the Lord, because they had no such ability. They wanted to do everything m their own selfish way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God is trying out and testing the integrity of those in line for positions of authority and power in connection with the kingdom of heaven. No one is capable of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cjercising</span><span class="font3"> authority until he has learned to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">obey</span><span class="font3"> authority. Humility means submissiveness Submissiveness means obedience . and obedience means to do the service of the Lord God m </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his appointed way</span><span class="font3"> “To obey is better than sacrifice” (1 Sam 15:22) It is of vital necessity to learn to be joyfully submissive or obedient to the Lord's will. The parable of the talents teaches this very requirement. It is obedience and loyalty that merit and receive the reward</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the parable the Lord committed to each one of his servants certain interests of his kingdom. Each servant must therefore make his accounting to the Lord No fellow servant is relieved of personal responsibility because of larger privileges of service held bv any other consecrated servant. “Every man shall bear his own burden” (Gal 6:5) “Talents,” that is. Kingdom interests, plus ability or loving and joyful submission to the Father's will, result in opportunities of service -, and by performing these opportunities of service faithfully the consecrated one proves Ins loyalty to the Lord. When those to whom the Kingdom interests are committed perform service as opportunities come to them, it constitutes ‘trading with the talent’. And in proportion as one faithfully, joyfully and lovingly shows his obedience and devotion to the Lord in the performance of such service, in that same proportion is the interest of the Kingdom as committed to him </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">increased, </span><span class="font3">and thereby more opportunities are furnished to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As an illustration ■ One fully submissive to the Lord enters the service of pioneer publisher of the Kingdom The Lord thereby commits to him certain talents or interests of His kingdom. The pioneer joyfully performs that service according to Theocratic organization instructions As he does so his capacity increases, and the Lord permits the interests of the Kingdom as committed to such consecrated one to abound or increase, by giving him wider opportunities of service in conducting home Bible studies, organizing new companies for Kingdom-publisher work in the field, giving Kingdom testimony before worldly courts, boards of authority, lawmaking committees, police officials, and bringing more persons of good-will to a knowledge of the Kingdom truth. The pioneer's performance of service under such circumstances is ‘trading with the talent’ within the meaning of this parable: “Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made tnem other five talents And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his Lords monev.” —Matt. 25:16-18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The accounting with the servants next considered takes place after the Lord Jesus Christ comes to the temple, and the facts viewed in the light of prophecy prove that he arrived at the spiritual temple of God in the spimg of A. D. 1918. “After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoncth with them. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou delivercdst unto me five talents behold. I have gamed beside them five talents more. His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful sonant tnou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee i tiler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy lord He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou delivercdst unto me two talents - behold, I have named two other talents beside them His lord said unto him. Well done, good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over manv tilings enter thou into the joy of thy lord &quot;—Matt 25 19-23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words of the Master indicate his presence at the temple some time before the reckoning takes place with 1 he consecrated, spirit-begotten servants on earth It was fust in A. D. 1922 that the presence of Jehovah's King. Chnst Jesus, at the temple vvas revealed to the faithful remnant According to the parable the one to whom were committed five talents comes forvvaid and reports that he has gamed other five talents To paraphrase his report: “Lord, von committed to me certain interests of your kingdom You gave me a measure of your spirit I have joyiullv submitted to your holy will, and yon have increased mv spirit and loving devotion to you , and by reason of voui goodness I have availed myself of these opportunities that have come to me; as a result of having your kingdom interests committed to me and of my loving devotion to you, I have had opportunity to prove my loyalty and devotion to you I have therefore increased my capacity, I have more of your spirit, and your kingdom interests have increased toward me a hundred percent,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord commends him, not because of what he lias gained, because, in fact, he brings no profit to the Lord, as the Lord himself points out at Luke 17 10. The Lord commends him because he has. by reason of joyful obedience, proved his faithfulness and loyalty: ‘You have been faithful over a few things, I will in the future make you ruler over many things; but enter now into the joy of your Lord.’ (Verse 21) Be it observed here that the reward of rulership is future, which is granted to the faithful remnant when finishing their earthly course and passing unto the heavenly life. Now, however, a joy is granted. What joy? The tremendous joy in the fact that the faithful one has a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and he knows that in 1914 Jehovah by Christ Jesus set up the long-promised Kingdom and that, as a servant of the Kingdom, the faithful one has a part in making this known to humankind as the only cure-all for the ills of man. There is joy, too. in knowing that the day of deliverance is at hand, and that the faithful remnant will soon enter into fullness of joy in the heavenly kingdom, and that the Good Shepherd is now gathering his &quot;other sheep&quot; in their many thousands unto the temple to associate with the remnant tn declaring Jehovah's name and publishing His kingdom. Those out of harmony with the Lord's way do not have such joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A report similar to the above is made by the servant to whom were committed two talents, and the Lord likewise commends him for his faithfulness and loyalty.—Vs 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then comes the one who had received the one talent, to make his report. To quote the parable: &quot;Then he which had received the one talent came and said. Lord. I knew thee that thou art an hard man. reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth - lo, there thou hast that is thme His lord answered and said unto him. Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowid not. and gather where I have not strawed thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which lie hath And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness&quot;—Matt 25 24-30</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is quite manifest that there was no joy in the heart of the one-talent servant, nor did the Lord invite him to enter into any joy The servant reports that he knew the Lord was a hard master, and so he was afraid and went and hid his talent in the earth, and now he was returning it. The Lord replied to him: &quot;Thou wicked and slothful servant ” Here </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wicked</span><span class="font3"> applies to those who have once been enlightened and then turned away, not having availed themselves of the privileges and joys of serving the Lord </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Slothful</span><span class="font3"> applies to those to whom something has been committed to do and perform and who have gone to sleep and done nothing The slothful ones have either hid the interests of the Lord's kingdom in worldly things or else treated it with indifference, or else have been serving self and looking to see how much glory and honor they might -win to themselves, which things are of the earth and not of the spirit. Undoubtedly it includes those who have commercialized the truth, either for money or for the plaudits of men, that they might shine in the presence of others; or who, because of sensual, earthly, selfish propensities have found fault with and despised the Lord’s Theocratic way, repudiated that, and insisted on doing things their own way, and have failed to learn obedience. Because of this unfaithfulness to the cause of the Lord Jesus as Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, the interests of the Kingdom which were committed to those proving wicked and slothful, and also the measure of the spirit bestowed at the time they showed some humility or obedience, are taken away from such unfaithful ones Also those Kingdom interests are committed to the class which has a greater measure of the Lord’s spirit Those who have been thus unprofitable to the Lord would then lose interest in the Kingdom truth and in proclaiming it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No one who has only one talent at the' time of reckoning can be of the Kingdom class. To pass judgment at the temple, each one of the remnant must have increased in the likeness of the Lord by following His steps as he left us the example of active service, zeal, worship, integrity, and faithfulness under suffering. Thus doing, then to him the Lord increases greater interests of the Kingdom and hence increases to him greater service opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This does not mean that the one who makes the greate^t outward show of service to the Lord is the one that is the most highly’ honored in the Kingdom. The instruction clearly given in the parable is this- That when one has committed to him the interests of the Lord’s kingdom, then in proportion as he shows his loyal and faithful demotion to the Lord by complete submission and obedience to the Lord, so will his service privileges be in the honor and glory of the Kingdom Each one, however, regardless of the amount of increase with which his trading with the Kingdom talents is blessed, must prove faithful unto death and maintain his integrity blameless And although the parable does not directly apply to the Lord's &quot;other sheep now being gathered to the temple for service there, yet such “other sheep” who are associated with the remnant entrusted with the Kingdom interests must pro\e loyal companions to them and must show an equal degree of faithfulness to the Kingdom and must hold fast their integrity to Jehovah God under all tests</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If, now, the Theocratic way is the Lord's way of carrying on his &quot;strange work” of witness before the battle of Armageddon begins, then fighting against that way or repudiating it means fighting against or repudiating the great Theocrat and his King, because the way is not of man, but is of the Lord God Failing or refusing to work or trade with the Kingdom talents in the Lords way is disloyalty to the great Theocrat Jehovah. If, now, upon examination anyone finds he has been just a little lax in showing forth God's praises and has somewhat slacked his hands m God’s service, this will be the opportunity to redeem the time. It is no time now for slothfulness, idleness, indifference, or slacking the hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Redeeming the time” (Eph. 5-16) means buying out from this evil time, seeing to it that we give all the time possible to the Lord’s service in looking after the interests of his kingdom. Jesus himself was fervent in spirit The Kingdom was uppermost in his mind and heart, because it is God’s way for vindicating His name and blessing all obedient humankind Jesus’ followers must likewise be fervent in spirit, and the Kingdom and its interests must be uppermost in the mind and heart of each consecrated one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font3">HE Bible sets forth the dealings of its Author, Jehovah God, with creatures on earth in the furtherance of his majestic purpose to clear his name before all creation and to bring the earth under a permanent righteous Government, Hence his written Word includes an account in historical order of human creatures who have figured prominently either as opposers or as faithful colaborers in the outworking of the divine purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The including of the words and conduct of such creatures in the sacred Record is not to glorify men or to concentrate the attention of Bible readers upon creatures for what they are in themselves, thus drawing away attention from the great Creator himself. It is done to offer examples of what all seekers of life and blessing must do and what they must avoid if they would receive the divine blessing and approval and avoid his curse and disapproval Referring to those Bible characters whose course had God's blessing and will be richly rewarded in due time, the apostle Paul wrote-“Be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises” (Heb. 6.12) Another writer, James, adds- ‘‘Take, my brethren, the prophets, wl-.o have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.”—Jas. 5.10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Warning against the disastrous course of others whose record is set forth in the Holy Scriptures, the apostle Paul says. “Noxv these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted Now all these things happened unto them for cnsamples: and they are xvritten for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come Wherefore let him that thmketh he standeth take heed [to those examples] lest he fall There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man” (1 Cor 10-6,11-13) It is xery evident that we are living in the end of the world long ruled uninterruptedly by Satan, and Jehovah’s righteous New World is at hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hence the historic examples of the entire Bible were written and preserved particularly for the benefit of all lovers of righteousness who are living today. Not that we ourselves are so important in God's sight, but that we are living in the most important time in earth s history and</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Neither the biethren m Britain nor those in the United States and other countries will be alarmed at this, for they know that not even the greatest world poxver on earth can defeat the purpose of the Lord or stop bis “strange work” now in progress before it is finished. (2 Cor 13.8) Almighty God Jehovah will continue to feed his people from his table of ‘‘meat in due season” henceforth in Britain as he has m other parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Also, the “other sheep” will continue to be gathered there, and in increasing numbers, for the spirit and word of Jehovah are upon his people and will not depart from them and they have been instructed by the Lord at the temple as to how to proceed with his work under conditions of persecution. Due protest has been made both to the king and to his prime minister at London, over this unwarranted assault against Christianity and restriction upon the worship of the Most High God and his King Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Instead of being disheartened by this seeming success of the haters of the light of truth in that hitherto bastion of free worship. Jehovah’s people in America and all other lands will appreciate more than ever their privilege of feeding at the Lord’s </span><span class="font3">these are “the last days&quot; and hence are “perilous times&quot; Now. more than ex-er before, there is danger of tailing into the enemy's trap. Hence to be able to stand xxe specially need the counsel of God's Word Every God-fearing person wants noxv especially to avoid any course that would result in being cut off from life m that Nexx World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the warning examples were xvritten in the Bible for the particular help and xvarntng of those undergoing the temptations of this critical time, it would be neglecting an important part of the Word of God for any to ignore also the lives of those xvhose course should be a danger sign to us. Every part of the Word of God is important, and many professing “Christians&quot; have been eternally harmed by the false argument that “Christians do not need the Old Testament: the Nexx- Testament xvas written for them and is all they need&quot;. Such an argument means to take axxay from the Word of God xvhich he has proxided for the sustenance and guidance of his needy people, and hence such argument stands condemned in the Lord's Word, at Revelation 22. IS. 19 and Deuteronomy 4.2 Also, at Romans 15: 4, the inspired xvritcr says. “Whatsoever ti mgs xvere written aforetime xvere xvritten for our learning, that xve through patience and [through] comfort of the scriptures might have hope.&quot; Wise persons xvho desire the full comfort of God’s Word and xvho xvant to manifest patient endurance in this trialsoine time xvill therefore heed the inspired apostle's words rather than those of some misguided, careless, self-conceited religionist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“As the chief of police had informed us while we were on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> street work that they had received several complaints and the city ordinance was against the work, and a license fee of $10 a day would have to be paid, I informed him our work was not commercial, but sacrificial. He treated us very fair about the matter, so I agreed to meet the city council and talk it over with them Here is the result. A new ordinance was written in their book of law allowing further work of Jehovah's witnesses and others in Bible work, with no charge for license. Mr. B. F. R----, mayor, and C. &amp;&nbsp;0 Ry. agent were presiding</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">officers. The mayor said it is better to go on the streets and from house to house preaching the gospel and putting out Bibles and religious literature than to be standing on the streets begging and gathering large crowds and bellowing, obstructing the public passway.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW “WATCHTOWER” EDITION OF THE BIBLE HANDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“In the courtroom our new ‘sword of the spirit’ functions perfectly Part of our defense was that we were engaged in our usual </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">business</span><span class="font3"> of advertising The Theocracy when arrested. The city attorney was arguing that we could hardly call our work a ‘business’. Jehovah's witnesses, in the audience, had been asked to be alert to assist our attorney with suggestions which might aid in our defense. One of our sisters recalled the scripture of Christ's saying, ‘Wist ye not that I must be about my Fathers business’’ and asked me in a note to look it up and pass it to our attorney for his argument Using the Concordance part of the Bilile I quickly found the citation, copied it, and passed it to our attorney. Only a moment later he opened his argument using that scripture in our defense I’ve never found things so easy to locate as in using this new Bible ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“The dav after the wonderful 52-eity national Assembly of Jehovah's witnesses 1 began witnessing in a 'Motel [motorists' hotel] court. I had just worked two cottages when the owner appeared on the scene and inquired if I had a license to peddle that there was a city ordinance against </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">peddling</span><span class="font3"> without a license and. besides, he did not allow soliciting on his premises The work was explained to him in a kind manner, showing him my ordmation as a minister was from the &quot;Higher Powers', therefore from the highest authority. His reply was, ‘You get out of here right now.’ I asked. ‘Do these people here pay you rent'” ’Yes.' he bickered; and then said I: ‘Would it not be their right and privilege to receive or reject persons at their doors?’ Retort ‘You get off of these premises’ My answer was a knock on the next door, at which he said. ‘I will call the police and let them throw you out ” going to the office. A young man answered the door and graciously received the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font3"> By the time the owner had returned I had placed three more of the beautiful books. He stood and listened to the witness being given at the door and finally disappeared to his ‘tree-trimming’, and I finished the court. Report of my day’s work was 7 bound books. 17 booklets, 22 magazines, and four back-calls. This blessed service becomes more dear to me day by day and I give thanks to Jehovah and Christ Jesus for such favor.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“I have pleasure in being able to say that the thirty-one model studies shown on my report card are regular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3">book studies and recorded lecture studies. I have met quite a few sheep in my territory. Though quite a number go out to work during the day, they are more than willing to spare me an hour one night a week. One Saturday afternoon I was witnessing from door to door when I came to a home where the husband was very much against us. The wife had chosen the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font3"> and had gone into the house to get the twopence. I heard her husband speaking rather loud as if he -were angry, but I did not hear what he said. When she came to the door again, she asked me if I had heard what her husband had said about Jehovah's witnesses. I said, ‘No.’ In answer to my reply her husband shouted out something about us. The wife walked into the house after giving me the money for the booklet, so I followed her in to the middle door to answer her husband s statements. I was able to make it quite plain to him whx we took our stand for The Theocracy and why we could not and would not compromise with the organizations of this world. I told him about the ‘two kings' (Dan. 11 27-45 , and then read to him Daniel 2:44. At first he said he would never read any of our books and would not give a penny for any of them. As he was saying this he picked up the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font3"> and as he opened the first page his hands were shaking so much because of his rage that the cover tore. (He did not tear it purposely.) However, after being there for nearly two hours he was a different man and fully agreed with our stand for The Theocracy, listening to the lecture “Model Prayer’ and fully agreeing with it. He then promised to read the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy. </span><span class="font3">and I have to call again another Saturday afternoon. He would like to know more about The Theocracy, and haie a model study in his home. His wife and their son of seventeen are also interested. I was given a cup of tea and some biscuits before I left to go home ’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“I asked a lady if she would like a copj of the latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> She asked: ‘What is it about” I told her a little about Jehovah's great Theocracy She took a copy Next Saturday afternoon she was at my corner again and took a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> I asked if she had heard any of the Watchtower recordings She had heard a few, but quite a while ago Since it was not convenient to plaj them where she was employed as housekeeper, I took her to my home and played ‘Comfort All That Mourn’ the next afternoon That evening I also took her to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. Next Saturday she was at my corner again and asked: ‘What have you for me todav ” I said: ‘A </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book, and a subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and a booklet.’ She subscribed right on the corner, as I had subscription blanks and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet with me. She said she liked our meetings better than her church, as every one was so busy and happy. Again at my corner Saturday she wanted to assist in a financial way until she knew a little bit more about the Kingdom message. No doubt she will be in the door-to-door work soon, as she said the time was very short.”</span></p>
