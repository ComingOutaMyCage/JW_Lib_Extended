</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font23">CONQUERING FEAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font0">T WOULD be as useless to try to hide world fear in this modern age as it would to suppress the fact that the sun had risen in the morning sky. Wherever that sun shines its rays disclose fear and dread. The East-West tension grips the globe like a vise. Broken down within these larger blocs individual nations and small groups of nations are divided by fear of one another. Crime, delinquency and open immorality run rampant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To a modem &quot;brain age” have these evils come. Do you think it incredible? True, noble experiments in global governments, international families of nations, exist. Religious councils and leagues seek to draw men together across international boundaries. Science produces machines that “think”, artificial parts for the body, almost unbelievable progress in surgery and in fighting disease through “miracle drugs”. International scientific and cultural organizations and other world teaching bodies meet to consider the world’s fears and problems. More is said about morals than ever, and sex education is far more prominent and available than ever before. AH these advantages does the world have. Yet its heart flutters and each day is lived as if it may be the last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, there is plausible reason. For example, consider the political minds who lead the world Said Trygve Lie, secretary general of the United Nations, on April 12, 1948: “Today, as in 1933, too many people are afraid. People are afraid in America. They are afraid in Russia. They are afraid in small countries like my own. And the governments, too, are acting as if they were afraid.” Do you believe that the scientists have helped to alleviate this fear? The opposite proves true, and even they are fear-struck. President Umphray Lee of Southern Methodist University told the Seventh Ecumenical Methodist Conference in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1947: “The fright of the scientists, not the cry of the dying, was the most significant point in the story of Hiroshima.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a last resort, men seek solace from religious guides, but for bread they are given a stone. An educational spokesman, Milton Burton, professor of chemistry at the sectarian Catholic University of Notre Dame, declared, in an interview following the Bikini atom bomb tests in 1946: “Anyone who has seen the destructiveness of the atomic bomb at first hand and up close, at Bikini or Hiroshima or Nagasaki or Alamogordo, knows that the days of the old world are numbered.” He proceeded to offer the alternatives of a human world government or an atomic inferno.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence, the people learn fear from their national examples. And when remedial measures are employed, matters only grow worse. In vain do they fill a serum needle with a poison in the hope of setting up immunity to the disease. They build bombs to quiet fears and ignite wars to keep peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Obviously, man cannot conquer fear and its causes exclusively on his own initiative. He sees only what is on the surface and his weapons are potent only against tangible, visible targets. Concerning the critical times in which this “end of the world” finds us, God’s Word, the Bible, tells us that unseen demonic powers an? driving the nations to final annihilation and that, in the meantime, these are the true cause that “men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coining upon the inhabited earth”.—Revelation 16:14,16; Luke 21:26, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">True, there never before were times like these, and never before this generation has the Devil been hurled down to the vicinity of the earth, here to be restrained and in “great anger, knowing he has a short period of time&quot;. (Revelation 12:12, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,)</span><span class="font0"> However, neither has the Bible ever before been thrown open to such wide understanding, published so broadly, and accompanied with such Bible helps as in this age. If the times are worse than ever, man's opportunity to still fears through the sustaining knowledge of God's Word is infinitely better than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the world’s “wise men” who overlook this priceless source of knowledge while basking in the dim light of their own wisdom, and especially to the religious clergy who piously prate Bible verses they do not understand and who keep secret the news of God’s kingdom while backing instead political makeshifts for world domination, Almighty God says as he once said to His covenant people, Israel's leaders:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Dazed shall you be, and amazed, blind shall you be, blind, fuddled—not with wine, reeling—not with liquor; for the Eternal has drenched you with stupor, closing your eyes and covering up your heads, till the sight of all this is to you no more than words in a sealed scroll * , . ‘Since this people draw near me with their mouth/ says the Eternal, ‘honouring me with their lips, while their hearts are far remote; since their religion is a mockery, a mere tradition learned by rote; I will now deal with them to their amazement, bewildering, surprising them, till their wise men lose their wits, and their clever men are fooled? ”—Isaiah 29:9-14, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moff,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What, then, is the formula for fearlessness, so free as to be open to all men of right heart toward God, yet so lofty as to escape the heady worldlings who scoff at God and mock his wisdom? Knowledge and understanding of God bring faith in him. Concerning this vital possession we read: “Everything that has been born from God conquers the world. And this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.” (1 John 5:4, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,) </span><span class="font0">Knowledge of God also brings great love for him, for hte mercy and loving-kindness. The apostle Paul ranks love far above special gifts or self-sacrifice; and he points up its unselfishness, humility and the manner in which it champions decency and all righteousness. Certainly one practicing true Christian love would not be numbered among the lawbreakers, warmakers or degenerates.—1 Corinthians 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Furthermore, love, being based on knowledge, knows what God can do for his cause and for those who uphold it. Forward without fear in God’s service, then, for “there is no fear in love, but perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint&quot;. (1 John 4:18, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> For a life free from the world’s ills now and expectant of lasting happiness and security under the incoming rule of God’s kingdom, how wise it is to seek this true Christian standard. Why not use it to conquer your fears and to bring gladness to those you meet?</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!'’ corrsiponcfent in Jamaica</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">F</span><span class="font0">ROM and after August 18, 1951, the eyes of the entire Western Hemisphere, and even such faraway places as Australia and New Zealand, turned to the comparatively obscure Caribbean island of Jamaica. But they are the eyes of pity and sympathy because of the devastation wreaked on this mere dot on the map, by what those who have lived long enough to know have described as the worst hurricane in over 50 years, and possibly in the island’s 457-year-old recorded history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jamaica’s being situated in the tropics, hurricanes are expected here from the later part of July to early November this period being designated as the hurricane season. Meteorologists say that around ths season as the autumn equinox approaches, the warm vapor-laden air, heated by the summer’s sun, begins to rise, producing an area of low pressure, which is filled by cooler and heavier air that rushes in, exerting an upward thrust on the warmer column. The rotary motion of earth exerts a pull on the rising air column that sets it spinning in whirlwind-like fashion at a velocity that may reach 75, 200 or even 300 milps per hour. Thus a hurricane is born. (See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> February 22, 1948, page 19.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first intimation we received of the ruthless monster was a brief Miami Weather Bureau report published in the August 16 issue of the island’s only daily newspaper, telling of its birth near the Leeward islands and of its moving at 15 miles per hour and carrying winds up to ICfo miles per hour at its center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From about 7:30 that fateful Friday night of the 17th, a light drizzle began trickling down in Kingston, joined later by a fanning gentle breeze that ordinarily would be welcome during the summer’s heat (which has been very intense this year) were it not the precursor of a violent blower far from gentle and most unwelcome. By 9; 30 p.m. the city was plunged into darkness after periodic blinkings of the electric lights, which served as a warning reminder of the shape of things to come. By then the wind had gotten very frolicsome, and the inhabitants of south and southeast Jamaica were faced with the grim reality of having to meet and weather an angry wind that cared about nothing but finding a pathway across land and sea, and that without looking for roadways, rail lines or mountain passes, but preferring to trample, smash and ride roughshod over all in its path.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Wild Wind Arrived</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Plunging, as it were, out of the darkness with an ominous rattle it began its non-</span></p><img src="g_E_19511122_files/g_E_19511122-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:331pt;height:294pt;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION OF PORT ROYAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">chaiant march snortly after 9:30 p.m., like a huge mechanized army that attacked in waves after its vanguard had made a break through the opposing lines. As its rainladen winds began their relentless pounding, tall and stately coconut palms and other huge trees started bowing in submission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the blackness, which was punctuated only by periodic sharp flashes of lightning, one could hear the whistling of the wind as in a carefree style it sped among the leaves. Weak houses that dared to oppose that ruthless, fast-moving enemy were swung off their supports or sent crashing in ruins, and, in many instances, bringing destruction to the animate and inanimate taking cover therein. Many of those more sturdily built that were too firmly entrenched to be completely knocked out were decapitated as their roofs were either completely smashed or their zinc sheets, shingles and tiles were removed with the precision of a skilled carpenter. This opened the way for the equally angry waters to drench the fear-struck occupants and their belongings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Frightening indeed it was that night when waves of wind hurled themselves against the strongest house, shaking it to its foundations with the vigor of an earthquake, and, with a hissing noise, dashed water through every crevice and the most closely joined seams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Huge ships were pushed aground as if mere chips in a rough ocean. Smaller craft were smashed with savage vengeance, baptizing some sixteen seamen in a watery destruction and leaving others to battle the churning waters of an angry sea, torrential rains, and a hideous wind, all working in destructive combination. It was a wild night of horror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Frantic men, women and children rushed from their crumbling homes to find Red-Cross-designated places of refuge, sometimes to find them also victims of an impartial wind. Some, in trying to reach places of safety, were swept away by swollen rivers and gully courses. Many are the stories of narrow escapes from crashing buildings or falling trees. The General Penitentiary in Kingston was badly damaged and 76 prisoners escaped. Four convicts were in a' certain yard demanding men’s clothes during the heights of the storm when from underneath a fallen house they heard cries for help. The escaped convicts worked hard to get four trapped women out from under the house and helped them to safety in a house that had not blown down, then returned to the premises where a grocery shop had partly blown down, demanded money and food from the terrified grocer who gave them money, also clothes. They looted the shop and disappeared, leaving behind four persons who will always think of them with gratitude and another who will remember them with a feeling of horror. Even the sick and infirm were not spared, as the wind caved in the roof of a poor infirmary ward, wiping out eight lives, smashed a hospital ward in Spanish Town and completely destroyed another hospital at Morant Bay. The wind was really wild.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How long those hours seemed as they dragged on! Each seemed a day in length! All waited and longed with nervous anxiety for the appearance of the dawn, which would at least throw some light on the dismal work of destruction and bring to an end a night of desolation. At about 1 a.m. a change in the velocity of the wind could be noticed, although one could hear its subdued yet still angry charges, accompanied by its watery companion of carnage, against the yet remaining trees and clinging zinc sheets. As the hours wore on, and the cyclonic conqueror plowed onward across the seas, a gradual decrease in the wind speed continued.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>The Morning After</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cam?</span><span class="font0"> the morning at last after a night of weeping, wailing and praying on the part of many. The monster had passed on without a backward Iodic of regret, and men, tense with expectancy, crept from the cramped places where they had spent the night and their energy trying to hold on to life. The lamentations of Jeremiah could well be repeated over the areas that received the mauling from the destructive denizen of the tropics. Oh, how the land lay desolate!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Electric and telephone poles lay sttewn amid a pile of debris in a mass of tangled wire and uprooted trees on city streets. All communications with different parts of the island were cut off; roads were blocked by fallen trees; electric power was cut off; the water supply stopped because of broken mains and lack of electric power. All <sub>t</sub>this thrown in for good measure, in four hours, by a howling, harassing wind that snuffed out at least 154 lives (by latest count), did over sixteen million pounds' worth (at $2.80 per pound, this is $44,800,000) of property damage, and placed the island face to face with starvation by its wanton destruction of crops in every parish. The comment on the lips of everyone who got the full blast of the wind, on seeing the havoc wrought, was, “Never have we experienced anything like this.” The worst, they say, was in 1903, yet it cannot be compared in destructive’ ness. Every day since, new tales of horror, death and destruction emerge.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Outlook</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Jamaica is a comparatively poor country economically, having a national budget expenditure of approximately eleven million pounds. With over 25,000 homeless, destitute and huddled in government schools and other public places, the need for rehabilitation and relief is urgent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Homes have to be rebuilt, damaged ones repaired, agriculture restored, plus the Immediate need for food, clothing and medical aid for those who left all behind in their flight to preserve life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Food parcels began coming in from neighboring countries, accompanied by messages of sympathy. The British government, of which Jamaica is a colony, has given the sum of £250,000 and the local governor has started a hurricane relief fund which has feceived substantial support from individuals and commercial organizations. Red Cross has set up strategic aid centers where the destitute and homeless can get food, clothing and shelter, The Watchtower Society quickly collected clothing from Jehovah’s witnesses in the New York city area and sent it to Jamaica, sixty-five cases totaling more than ten tons being transported there free of charge by one of the United Fruit Company’s ships. Within forty-eight hours after receipt in Jamaica it had been distributed among the needy ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fear has even been expressed that when the tumult and the shouting of the present dies many will be left forgotten and without relief reaching them. This is not an unwarranted fear, as the last such disaster in 1944 is cited as a striking example in support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So, pressing as the need for material provisions is in the present crisis, the need for comfort and hope through the right kind of knowledge is even more pressing. Such is not forthcoming from orthodox religion, which leaves the people confused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But in this time of uncertainties and distresses, as at other times, Jehovah's witnesses will continue to spread comfort to the mourning inhabitants by telling them of the Kingdom now established that will soon usher in a new-worid in which there will be lasting peace and complete security from such disasters.</span></p>

Noting that the U.

His piece touched a nerve: in the following week, 1,006 people had tried to reach him by phone or had written him letters or stopped him on the street to talk about it. Forty publications have reprinted it. Seltzer's piece, titled ‘Can't We Tell Right from Wrong?’*:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Some people think it dates back to the First World War. . . . There are those who think science and the assembly line started it as we turned into the 20th century. ■ . -Some blame the philosophy of Sufficient Unto the Day Is the Evil Thereof, induced by . . . depressions and wars, . . . The analysts, whose job it is to examine our national behavior, ... do not agree among themselves. About this, though, they do agree. Something has happened to us as a people—something serious. We have gained much in the last hali-century. We have lost something, also. . . . Has what we gained been more important than what we lost?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“What is wrong with us? It is in the air we breathe. The things we do. The things we say. Our books. Our papers. Our theater. Our movies. Our radio and television. The way we behave. The interests we have. The values we fix. We have everything. We abound with all of the things that make us comfortable. We are, on the average, rich beyond the dreams of the kings of old, . . . We lead in everything—almost. Yet . . . something is not there that should be— something we once had. . . . Stalin, like Hitler, thinks we’re soft, preoccupied with material things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">‘'Are we our own worst enemies? Should we fear what is happening among us more than what is happening elsewhere? , . . Why has a moral deterioration set in among us that brings corruption, loose behavior, dulled principles, subverted mofals, easy expediencies, sharp practices? . . . What corrupts our top people? What has taken away the capacity for indignation that used to rise like a mighty wave and engulf the corrupters—the corrupters of public office, of business, of youth, of sports? What is it?

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!&quot; correspondent In Honduras </span><span class="font0">MARRIAGE and morals, while not easily controlled by mankind, are always subjects of interesting discussion and investigation. Spanish Honduras with its more than a million inhabitants, who, as a whole, are a friendly and likable people, does have its share of superstitious oddities in connection with the behavior of the sexes. Most Hondurans are Roman Catholics, that religion being the country’s spiritual guide for more than four centuries. The few superstitious marriage and moral customs here described are certainly not practiced by all Hondurans but are more generally found among the less educated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Describing the unorthodox marriage customs of the “Zambos", Negro-Indian mixture of the mosquito coast section of Honduras, Peter Keenagh, writer explorer, has this to say: &quot;The Zambus of the Patuca are polygamous. But their polygamy is not the orderly marital pluralism of most primitive tribes; it is little more than sanctioned promiscuity. Wedding ceremonies take place four times a year, and in these the whole of the tribe takes part. . . . there is feasting and revelry for three days, after which there follows a matrimonial General Post, The young are married for the first time, and only those who have proved themselves capable of child-bearing are allowed to compete. Among the senior members of the village wives are exchanged and bought and sold, on the quarterly wedding days, according to the</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19511122_files/g_E_19511122-7.png" alt="" style="width:148pt;height:187pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">whims of the husbands and the prices they are able to pay for their friends’ wives- And, let it be understood, exchange of wives at any other time but the four appointed ‘wedding days’ is regarded as extremely immoral.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Spanish Indian or “Mestizo", who makes up the greater part of the population, has his customs relative to the taking of a companion or companions of the opposite sex. Changes are frequent as to such companions and are made, in many cases, much as one would change an old garment for a new. Since more than fifty per cent of the Hondurans live together without the legal binding of a wedding ceremony a difficult problem is posed for the lover who may not wish to see his companion depart for a more alluring object of affections. Some rather amazing superstitious practices are carried on to prevent a separation and to prolong the duration of this common-law form of marriage.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>How to Hold a Man in Honduras</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">In many cases the woman, noting evidences of wandering affections on the part of her erstwhile more ardent companion, will resort to this trick, supposed to be very effective in maintaining his decreasing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">amor.</span><span class="font0"> The body of a rag doll, a few</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19511122_files/g_E_19511122-8.png" alt="" style="width:150pt;height:191pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">hairs from the man’s head and some stickpins make up the equipment to be used The pins are stuck into the body of the doll, pushed downward where the heart might be, and some are also stuck in from the lower part of the body pushing upward. Leaving the pins thus stuck into the doll and with the hairs placed in or about it, it is now imagined to be the body of the gentleman in question. The next step in this demonic practice is to bury the body in ,or about the premises where the man lives; all of this, without his knowledge, of course. Having done this the woman may now believe that the man is completely entrapped, while she may commit as many unfaithful acts as she wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">puro</span><span class="font0"> or cigar superstition is still another trick thought to be effective in bringing back the male whose wandering fancies have taken him afield. This practice is not exclusively the ladies’, however, but is also tried by rejected men. A cigar is smoked in this particular ritual, the person doing it using seven or thirteen -matches for lighting and increasing the intensity of the tobacco embers. A pin may be inserted in the cigar before beginning, forming a cross. Also, it must be smoked backward, that is to say, the end that ordinarily would be lit goes into the mouth and the other end lit. The smoke is not inhaled but drawn rapidly into the mouth and expelled, much on the order of the puffing done by a locomotive on a hard pull. Great care is used, however, not to break the ash, causing it to fall, because the ordeal must be prolonged as long as possible. During all this more matches are being lit, and the credulous one must read a short prayer, which, among other things, invokes the aid of the Devil in the return of the person desired. By now, if it happens to be a person not accustomed to smoking perhaps not even a cigarette, much less the rank tobacco of the handmade </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">puro,</span><span class="font0"> a deathly sickness has set in, accompanied by vomiting. Finally, the ash falls and the remains of the cigar are thrown backward over the shoulder, terminating the ritual. Now, according to the theory, it is only a matter of a short time and the person who has been the object of the invocation will return again to the desirous one, never again to roam. In spite of the absolute worthlessness of the foregoing superstitious practice in reuniting the loose marital knot it no doubt leaves a lasting impression on the mind and stomach of the first-time smoker of the puro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Also, there is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fresco,</span><span class="font0"> or soft drink prescription, which is supposed to be a lethal “Mickey Fin”, when administered to the unsuspecting adored one via his food or drink. The lady will take water in which she has washed her feet and mix it together with some fruit juice and sugar, making a soft drink. Now when the object of her affections comes along he may be surprised at her generous offer of refreshment; he may even think, “Why, I've hardly noticed her at all.” So with the drinking of this brew he is supposedly entrapped and irresistibly drawn to the practitioner of this bit of witchcraft. And so the pause that would ordinarily be refreshing might be the pause that infects one with hoof and mouth disease. It is certain that the desired effect is not obtained.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Catholic Influence a Failure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The failure of these demon practices to hold men and women together in the marital state is seen in the vital statistics of Honduras. More than half the children born in the country are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hijos naturales, </span><span class="font0">that is to say, children born to unwed parents. Many of the women have children by a number of different men, while many of the men father children by several different women. The complexity of the family pattern can be well imagined. The only wedding ceremony for many of the natives from the mountains and rural sections is described by one of the Hondurans, who said: “They walked together through the shadow cast by the Catholic Church, not being able to afford the costlier Catholic ritual reserved for the more economically favored sons of the church?' The blame for the lack of moral training over a period of more than four hundred years does rightly come to rest at the door of the self-proclaimed “Guardian of faith and morals’, the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In spite of the scarcity of help from such religious quarters it must be said that many self-respecting Hondurans are taking advantage of increasing educational facilities made available by the civil authorities of the land. In addition to such educational advantages a new and powerful force, Bible truths being taught by Jehovah's witnesses, is being felt, reaping, as it grows, fruits of righteousness. Over the past few years quite a number of Hondurans have learned right moral requirements from the Bible and have legalised their marriage ties. As this article is being written more than a score of pairs heretofore living together without benefit of such legal sanction are preparing their papers and other affairs in order that they may be married in a recognized manner by their local civil officials. On the lighter side of these weddings being consummated throughout the country is the fact that in some cases the weddings are attended by the bride and bridegroom’s children and, in a few cases, by their grandchildren. Always lovers of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiestas</span><span class="font0"> or joyful get-togethers these Latin Americans will sometimes celebrate their marriage, inviting their friends of like moral standards and beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus a great many honest, humble and very likable Hondurans are moving forward with higher moral and educational standards made possible to them, leaving behind the enslaving superstitious practices of the ignorant. More and more their eyes are being opened to a glorious hope of a clean new world just ahead that will forever blot out the stains of corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">'Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Pat"</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C. Under this heading the Manila </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times of</span><span class="font17"> September 1, 1951, presented varied opinions regarding the right of school children to refrain from flag saluting. Present Philippine secretary of justice, Jose P. Bengzon, ruled arbitrarily in relation to children of Jehovah's witnesses, that they could be compelled to salute on threat of expulsion. World-wide, Jehovah’s witnesses have always consistently held that for them to salute flags would be a form of idolatry. One writer to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font17">without indicating how his reasoning affected the case of those who sincerely refrained from the practice, said that Bengzon &quot;should be congratulated by every Filipino who wants to teach and bring up his children with patriotism next to loving God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C. E. K. Stewart, branch servant for Jehovah's witnesses in the Philippines, cited Justice Jackson of the U. S. Supreme Court in defending the position taken by Jehovah’s witnesses, as follows: &quot;If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox In politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C Stewart said further: &quot;If Jehovah’s Witnesses were to change their belief every time there was a change in the person occupying the office of secretary of justice, they would be very inconsistent. Their belief does not rest on the opinion of a secretary of justice. It rests on the infallible Word of Almighty God which tells Christians: ‘We ought to obey God rather than men.’ *’</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Rise and Fall of the Amoeba</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">According<span class="font17"> to the fancy of evolution, life keeps proceeding merrily on its way, on- y ward and upward forever. Scholarly men declaim that simpler organisms became more complex, gradually producing the many varieties of life now in existence. But evolutionists have been driven from cover to cover in retreat while searching for living examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">4. Thwarfed when, seeking such examples in higher life forms, evolutionary scientists * turned to more elementary organisms. Among the one-celled creatures they dabbled, hoping for a slight variation here, a mutation there, t anything at all from which they could sus- </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">jf </span><span class="font17">pend the idea that life was evolving to ever higher planes. Then along came the little onecelled amoeba. </span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What was it that the evolutionists saw in the amoeba? Not for looks did they seek to ? wed it to their theory. The amoeba is only a microscopic blob that for long was mistaken for ordinary bread mold. Only in 1902 was the entire group clearly defined. Most recent find that became of interest to evolutionists &gt;&nbsp;was that of Kenneth B. Raper of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. He uncovered a new variety of the amoeba family, now known intimately as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Dictyostelium discoideum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The outstanding feature of this latest amoeba acquaintance is that it is not content to live its life in the same old rut Like Its relatives, Dictyostelium is sexless, dividing by binary fission (at maximum growth </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font17"> the amoeba divides into two “daughter” S amoeba of approximately equal size) to re- \ produce its kind. It feeds by absorbing bacteria. It has the characteristic shape. However, when a sufficient number of them get &gt;&nbsp;together, they rush into one unified, chain-like form that moves off in a manner strikingly like that of a worm. Then, as if suddenly finding a neighborhood in which it desires to settle down, this outstanding amoe- <sup>1 </sup>ba formation stops and proceeds to grow upward. A collection of swollen amoebas form j at the top as the form changes shape. A narrow stem holds connection between this &gt;&nbsp;round, ball-like head and its base. At this point the growth may attain a height of oneeighth of an inch. They flourish in beds of dead leaves on the dank, wqt floors of forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But just at this point the life story takes a disastrous turn for the interests of evolution. The amoeba growth does not long enjoy its new-found luxury. Perhaps if evolutionists had their way they would write a “happy” ending, with the amoebas living happily ever after in more and more complex forms. But alas, not so in real life. Soon the elevated growth wilts, then crashes back to earth, releasing the independent amoebas composing its communal arrangement. The entire cycle, from single amoebas to the more complex growth to its brief zenith and its final fall, takes but four days. And in the end the supposedly &quot;evolving” amoeba has “devolved” right back to its starting place. Says John Tyler Bonner, assistant professor of biology at Princeton University, in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span class="font17"> of June, 1949:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;One might just as well say that these forms represent an evolution in the reverse from Dictyostelium to a common amoeba. All I can ask is that you assume somewhat arbitrarily that this is not so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">V Trying to find proof that Dictyostelium is a truly evolutionary &quot;advancement” from common amoebas, the same writer said: &quot;It is harder to see why Dictyostelium is a more effective organism than common amoebas. In fact, there is always the possibility, luhfcft. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">we will ignore,</span><span class="font17"> that it is not.” [Italics oursl After describing how the amoebas are joined into a multicellular structure, he concludes with this thought: &quot;It has, however, turned out to be a blind alley in evolution reaching little further than Dictyostelium itself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">* And one must always remember that after this supposedly evolutionary movement upward into a supposedly advanced stage of development, all of which we are to “assume somewhat arbitrarily”, the multicellular structure collapses, dispersing the amoebas in their original, one-celled form. From this may we not assume, and not so arbitrarily either, that in this four-day test, evolution's hopes take wing from single cells and rise to their greatest height, one-eighth of an inch from a damp forest floor, only to plunge again into mossy oblivion?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">S</span><span class="font0">MOKE is a costly menace. According to one authority it costs the people of the United States upward of five billion dollars annually. It costs them more than does their medicine, their private education or their periodicals. Elimination of smoke would save each American some $20 on personal laundry and cleaning bills; would save Americans about twenty per cent of their fuel bills; would cut their housewives' cleaning work in two and would reduce by two-thirds the need of painting their homes. The cost of smoke to New York city’s real estate owners and merchants alone is $130 million annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As has been well observed, it is strange indeed that the people of the United States who carry the adage of “Cleanliness is next to godliness” to an almost fanatical extreme in the way of sanitary devices should be content to live and breathe in “an ocean of dirt”, “a sea of coal grime, sulphuric acid and aerial garbage&quot;. Why, a single cubic foot of city air contains as many as “three million particles of solid matter plus assorted liquids and gases”! Each year the 800,000 chimneys of New York city spew out some 38A thousand tons of soot, depositing it on the real estate at the rate of 100 tons per square mile. In a single breath of air a New Yorker may inhale some 70,000 particles of grit and dust. Is it any wonder that autopsies reveal that a city dweller’s lungs are black while those of a farmer are still pink?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The smoke and fumes belched out by the fumaces of industry not only pollute city air and real estate, and the city dweller inside and out, but they also do much harm to vegetation. In certain Pacific Coast areas fumes and smoke cause millions of dollars’ worth of damage annually to such crops as endive, spinach, tomatoes and alfalfa.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>The Menace to Health</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The most serious aspect of the pall of smoke and fumes plus fog that hangs over our cities, generally known as “smog”, is the harm it does to the human body. Smog can be a sensational killer, as when it took more than 70 lives in the Meuse region of Belgium, from December 1 to 5, back in 1930; and when it took 22 lives in Donora, Pennsylvania, in the last week of October 1948. Suits totaling into the millions were filed against the company responsible for the Donora disaster, and were settled out of court for $235,000, a mere five per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A group of scientists who studied the smog disaster at Donora stated that the air pollution which caused the deaths could have been prevented. They also stated: “We can now say positively what could not be said before with scientific proof—that contamination of air in industrial areas can cause serious acute, disabling diseases.” No wonder then that in London, during one week of particularly heavy smog, the death rate rose 20 per cent above the average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Foremost among the serious diseases whose incidence is increased by smoke are cancer, pneumonia and tuberculosis. Statistics show that the “more smoke there is, the higher the death rate from cancer of the lungs, tuberculosis and pneumonia”. In some large cities as many as 700 deaths annually may be attributed to smoke. Smoke hurts the lungs by irritating the mucous membranes of the lungs and throat, and often causes violent coughs, which place a severe strain on both the heart and respiratory system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Smoke also causes many minor irritations, In Los Angeles, California, on 53 days in 1948, as much as half of its population was affected with smarting eyes, nose and throat irritations; and the situation has not improved since. In the past year New Yorkers living on Staten Island suffered from stomach disorders, nose irritation and inability to sleep because of the smoke from New Jersey smelters. Big business always blames the weather, but foremost medical authorities point out that fog alone could not cause such effects. At best the fog causes the smoke and fumes to settle down. Even in this, however, big business may be to blame, as often it is the smoke that is responsible for the fog.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Cause and Prevention of Smoke</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">What causes smoke? The prime factor is incomplete oxidation of the combustible material used and which may be due to failure to properly regulate the burning process. As a rule the presence of smoke means that fuel is being wasted, whether it be in a kitchen stove of a householder or in the furnaces of large industrial plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then again smoke may be due to certain impurities in the fuel that simply will not burn. Usually 15 per cent of coal is ash, and some of this is bound to go up the chimney. Also, most coal and oil have about two per cent sulphur, some of which gets outside of the chimney. Sulphur fumes united with moisture become weak sulphuric acid, which eats holes in laundry and mars the paint on houses. And then again the surface condition of fuel may be at fault, a factor rather difficult to control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But smoke can be controlled and prevented, and there are many ways of doing this. It can be controlled by baffling chambers, which slow up the smoke so that the particles in it fall out. It can be controlled by an electric precipitator, in which the particles are first charged by negative plates and then trapped by positive plates. It can be controlled by the water spray system, in which high-pressure jets wash out the dirt particles. Or by the condensation method, in which the smoke passes between two walls, the one hot, the other cold, the particles clinging to the cold wall. Or by high-frequency sound waves which shake out the soot. '‘Smoke guns” are being considered whereby the smoke would be shot a mile into the air. Steam pressure jets in the furnaces themselves help to bring about more nearly perfect combustion, thereby decreasing smoke density, carbon loss and dust emission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When blamed for smoke, industry likes to point to the thousands of dwellings that give forth smoke and the large number of autos that emit fumes. But let it be noted that these are negligible factors. When the steel strike was on, many downtown Pittsburghers, for the first time, saw the stars in the sky. The steel strike had not eliminated the use of autos or domestic heating. Los Angeles had a traffic problem for many years, but only with the coming of war industries did it also have a smog or smoke control problem. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font0"> in its discussion of the subject, shows a difference as great as that between day and night in the way certain cities of England look during the week when the industry is working and Sundays when the furnaces are banked.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Smoke Control Legislation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Where industry is not. concerned with the welfare of the people in the matter of smoke it becomes the duty of the duly elected representatives of the people to make it get in line. And that is not an easy thing to do. Industry takes the position that smoke control is too expensive, and so it hypocritically mouths co-operation while its actions are those of delay and defeat. Typical is the advertisement which the Consolidated Edison placed in a New York newspaper telling of the sums of money it had spent in smoke control. What the advertisement failed to state, however, was that Consolidated Edison was still the worst of air in New York city</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and that with its sulphur fumes it was ruining the appearance of the beautiful new glass structure of the United Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In .its refusal to co-operate with smoke control, industry may actually be penny wise and pound foolish. States one automobile manufacturer: “The installation of the new dirt-catching cupolas brought about an increase in production capacity of close to 50 per cent.” One West Coast smelting plant reluctantly spent $50,000 for special equipment to clean its smoke of solids, which solids it is now selling for $100,000 a year. (Of course, not all smoke solids are so valuable; there are some that are 100 per cent worthless.) A New Jersey industry was required to install new furnaces so as to be able to control its smoke. In three years the furnaces more than paid for themselves in decreased fuel consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Regardless of profits, however, smoke control must be in industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">dustry. Big business should be made to recognize smoke for the’evil menace it really is, even though it may involve an added expense of two per cent in both installation and operation, and should therefore reconcile itself to including the cost of smoke control in its necessary expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Smoke control, as noted by Heilbroner in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Harpers,</span><span class="font0"> January 1951, requires good, stiff municipal or state ordinances, with sharp teeth and ample power. (They need, not be as strict as those passed centuries ago in England, one of which provided for the furnace’s being smashed at the second offense and another for the beheading of the offender! Fortunately, the latter was soon repealed!) Modern smoke control also requires trained staffs of engineers able to pass on new equipment and to advise on old. It also requires skilled administrators able to get the public aroused over the smoke situation. Certain European countries Stringent laws governing smo'Ke. Results are being obtained in the United States, although thus far the surface has only been scratched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">St. Louis, Missouri, which at one time was among the very worst cities as regards the smoke menace, has, by going after the problem in real earnest, cut its smoke 75 per cent in the last ten years. And as far back as 20 years ago, Salt Lake City, Utah, cut its air pollution 96 per cent. Hudson County, New Jersey, hired a smoke expert to conduct its campaign against smoke and, in a short time, had reduced its smoke 85 per cent. Being satisfied with the results, the smoke control board was disbanded, only to have the smoke menace increase 40 per cent in just a few months. It seems that eternal vigilance is the price of a clean atmosphere, even as it is of liberty!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pittsburgh long held the reputation of being the smokiest city in the United States. In recent years it bas gone after the smoke menace with such vigor as to reduce it some 40 per cent In fact, the situation improved so much that the Pennsylvania Railroad, for the first time, had its station cleaned, confident that it would stay clean long enough to make the effort worth while. After 110 years of trying, Pittsburghers are at last beginning to see the light’ Pittsburgh, by the way, is the place where the word “smog” was coined, a combination of “smoke” and “fog”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every few years irate New Yorkers engage in an anti-smoke crusade. The current year saw another one of these, with the housewives crying: “Where there's smoke there’s ire!” Politicians shouted and fines began to be imposed—on the little fellows. The smoke control board was found to be at war with itself as to whether or not it should proceed in earnest against the city’s biggest air polluters, the Consolidated Edison, and, ironically enough, the city's own Board of Transportation, its Department of Sanitation and state and federal agencies. It finally decided that government agencies were not to be penalized. An editorial in the New York Times, which correctly summed up the situation, was aptly entitled “Smoke Control By and By”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That political corruption played its part in the New York smoke menace is apparent from the item appearing in the New York </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font0"> May 16, 1951, telling of the resignation of the stationary engineer member of the smoke control board. A twofold investigation found that he had forced operators of furnaces and power plants to buy certain devices for smoke control for which he received commission from the manufacturers, and that certain smoke violators had paid him for immunity from prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Smoke is a costly and needless menace whose toll in both dollars and health is truly enormous. Politicians agitate for smoke control while their elections are in the offing, but soon thereafter are likely to forget all about it. While public-spirited citizens do well to work for smoke control, Christian ministers, dedicated to God’s service, have a far greater menace against which to campaign: that of helping the people to see the sunlight of God’s kingdom through the spiritual smog of false religion. Soon that kingdom will end both the spiritual and the mundane smogs that now afflict the lives of men. Everyone sincerely repeating the “Lord’s prayer” is in fact praying for that very time. And Bible prophecy shows that we are standing at its threshold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Back in 1941 the falcon came into prominence in this capacity when the Royal Air Force was ready to take drastic action to end the falcons' assaults on British carrier pigeons. A falcon enthusiast made the suggestion that the falcons could be converted to the R.A.F/s own purposes, and so the birds came to be drafted for use against enemy pigeons. Since then their peacetime use has evolved, and during the ^ays of the Berlin airlift British airmen tn Germany requested that some of them be sent to the continent to clear Berlin’s Gatow airfield of daily thousands of starlings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By <sup>u</sup>Aw&lt;ikel’' &lt;fcrr«pondent in Nigeria</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">O</span><span class="font0">N ENTERING a shop in this teeming city of Ibadan, Nigeria, the sight of silk, satin, linen and cotton greeted my eyes. The place was jammed With cloth, some in bales. much piled in heaps, a great quantity stacked on racks, and yards hung up on display. The whole shop seemed to be choked with it, and the very air was tainted with the smell of fabric. Squeezed in the midst of all this textile sat a gloomy shopkeeper. With chin and head buried in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">palms of of his large hands, he</span><span class="font0"> appeared oblivious to my entry and quite indifferent or unconscious of the movements and happenings around him. Cheerfully I greeted him, &quot;Good morning.” No reply. I repeated the greeting, but still, silence. Turning to the shopboy, I asked, &quot;What is wrong with your master?” “Oh! the master is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fasting.</span><span class="font0"> That </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is why he does not </span><span class="font0">speak. You see, we are Mohammedans and today, being June the sixth, we begin our Ramadan fast which will last thirty days. It is the Moslem equivalent of the Christian lent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;Tell me, just how and why do you observe your fast?” &quot;We must fast because the Koran, which is our Bible, commands us to do so. It is said that while Mohammed was at Medina he observed the Jews </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER 22, 1951</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fasting on a certain day, and being told that Moses had kept a fast on that day in commemoration of the delivery of the Israelites from Pha-</span><span class="font2">1 </span><span class="font0">faoh’s hands, he remarked that </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mos-</span><span class="font2">I </span><span class="font0">iems were nearer to Moses than the </span><span class="font2">I </span><span class="font0">Jews and therefore ordered that that </span><span class="font2">I </span><span class="font0">Jay was to be observed as a day of </span><span class="font2">I </span><span class="font0">fasting. Later, the entire month of </span><span class="font2">K </span><span class="font0">Ramadan was set apart for that purpose, for it is the month in which the Koran was sent down from heaven for man's guidance. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">During this month it</span><span class="font0"> is incumbent upon every Moslem to abstain from food, drink, smoking, use of perfume and sexual intercourse from dawn till sunset. After sunset it is lawful to indulge in all these things. At the moment we eat only twice a day, before dawn and after sunset. Those who might be on a journey, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font0"> sick, or nursing mothers, are allowed to postpone the observance until a more convenient time, while the aged and infirm have to see to the feeding of a poor person during the month in lied of the fast”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“What is the purpose of all this?” I further inquired. &quot;We fed it is a means of gaining virtue and thus finding favor with God. A person who abstains from enjoying lawful things at the command of God will hate to touch unlawful things. The holy prophet, Mohammed, said: ‘Illumine your heart by hunger and strive to conquer yourself by hunger and thirst. Continue to knock at the gates of paradise by hunger? ”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>To the Praying Grounds</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Thirty days of ‘knocking at the gates of paradise by hunger’ went by and finally July the sixth dawned. The morning air over Ib<sup>a</sup>dan swelled and ebbed with sound as of mighty waters, the murmur of many voices, multitudes of tramping feet. What is it? The climax has come. The breaking of the Ramadan fast. The day has been</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">declared a public holiday. The Moslem male population is pouring out of the city like a mighty river, flowing into the spacious praying grounds on the outskirts. By 8 a.rn. thousands have deluged the place. The two roads leading to the praying grounds give the appearance of rIVera in full flood, surging and brimming with devotees of Mohammed, bubbling with religious fervor; driven by the strong current of devotion to Allah and the religious significance of the day, the festival of Id-Ul-Fitri marks the close of the fast. One, two, three hours go by and still they keep streaming, pausing momentarily at the brim of the open-air mosque to remove shoes, swirling around the water fountain to wash face, hands, arms and ankles before spilling over to fill and overflow the praying grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Watch them come! A feast for the eyes, A symphony of color in movement, as young and old pass by in delicate lace and silk, in long, flowing robes brightly hued in sky blue, rose, amber, lilac, emerald and glossy white, charmingly patterned and richly embroidered. All this capped by maroon or yellow </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fezzes</span><span class="font0"> and white or orange turbans. They flowed along on foot, and on gaily decorated horses, keeping rhythm to the roll and rumble of drums. They came with praying beads, their rosaries, and with praying rugs or the branches of trees. Strange! Not a woman to be seen among the countless worshipers. Why not? They are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">forbidden </span><span class="font0">to step onto the praying ground, because considered unclean, and there is the danger of their distracting the males.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With this river of worshipers drift hundreds of beggars, planting themselves along the banks of the highways and in the name of Allah drawing sustenance from the flowing crowd. A pitiful and repulsive sight. Wrecks of humanity, some blind, others with bent and crooked bodies, limbs twisted into all shapes, bodily parts consumed by leprosy and other diseases, all crying for help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But let us turn our attention to the praying grounds. There is the aged king of Ibadan sitting on a mat under the shelter of a mauve-and-gold umbrella. Look! who is that man prostrating before him? The costly dress, the white linen garment embroidered with gold, the ermine cap— he must be some prominent chief. Listen! He’s singing in a high-pitched, feminine voice. Oh, just seeking </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alms. He snatches the </span><span class="font0">coins flung and quickly passes on among the crowd for other handouts. The time approaches for the praying to begin. What a sight to behold! Acre upon acre, row after row of worshipers, squatting on a carpet of white sand spread under green trees and colorful umbrellas. Patiently many have been squatting for hours. Beggars taking advantage of this ply Up and down the rows of the faithful, forcefully reminding them of their religious obligation of giving alms. Even bread vendors with an eye to business have the audacity to enter the holy grounds. Following the beggars they sail down the aisles, but are soon seen scurrying away amidst a storm of protest</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Prayer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Everybody is now waiting for the chief Imam who will lead in prayer. Here he comes on a black mount and dressed in a long, flowing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cream-colored robe,</span><span class="font0"> a white turban passing under the chin and piled a foot high on top of the head. Smiling, he dismounts, takes off his shoes, pays homage to the king, and disappears among the thousands. Soon a long drawn-out cry is heard. The vast multitude rises like the ocean. A hush fills the place. In unison hands are raised shoulder high with palms upturned to heaven. For a moment, motionless, in silent meditation, offering thanksgiving and making silent request for peace and prosperity. Then like the rising and falling of the waves they bow with face to the ground; then rise, then prostrate, twice touching the sand with their foreheads. A second time they go through the same motions. The prayer is over. everybody shouts “Allah” and the tide returns, gushing out of the field, spilling down every outlet and channel, a mighty tide of rushing, jostling, bobbing color and flowing robes, returning to the city and flooding it with feasting, drinking, dancing and drumming, thus drowning out the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On this occasion millions of Moslems throughout the world, in all sincerity, offer up prayers for peace and prosperity. The “Holy Year” of 1950 saw millions of Catholic prayers offered for peace and tranquillity. Add to all this the countless millions of peace prayers by Protestants and other religious systems. Yet, what are the results? It seems that the more religious bodies pray for peace the farther the world gets away from peace, and today religion’s very existence is threatened. Why? Listen to Isaiah’s answer: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord. </span><span class="font0">. . , Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. . . . And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.” (Isaiah 1:11-20) In view of this, what is left for all persons to do? Turn to Jehovah God, study his Word, the Bible, and serve him according to instructions issued therein. Then their prayers will be answered, God’s new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">pope Befriend evolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">D</span><span class="font17">ESPITE the Steady retreat of evolution before the advance of the Bible and scientific fact, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has extended a helping hand to the godless &quot;ism”. In an encyclical of August, 1950, Pius said that &quot;the teaching authority of the Church does not’IorbiiT'tllfil IM<sup>1</sup> IL’bfilormity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology research and discussions on the part of men experienced in Doth fields take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre existent and living matter*’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;[ In </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">September, 1951</span><span class="font17">, an Associated Press dispatch reported that, in explanation of the 1951) encyclical, &quot;Pope Pius XII says that the theory of evolution can be studied so far as it deals with origins of the human body but should nut be allowed to raise questions as to divine creation of the human soul,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;£ The pope’s clear stand on the matter nils embold£n£crnis clergy to follow suit. Last spring, &quot;Father” John P. O’Brien, C.S.V., of the Marquette University biology department, declared that it is </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">“just not true</span><span class="font17">” that the evolution theory conflicts with religion. O'Brien said that </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">Catho</span><span class="font17">lic schools should either teach evolution or explain </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">to pupils that there is no objection to it. Briefly</span><span class="font17">rHC lauded the scientific work of Charles Darwin, nineteenth-century cornerstone of evolution, as “a great accomplishment of a God-given mind”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;£ Has the pope been swayed by evolution's argument that the human body betrays links to an earlier form of life?

<p><span class="font11">E</span><span class="font17">VEN in this supersonic age man has no monopoly on speed. In animat marine and bird life are to be found speed merchants who on land, sea and in the air are able to pass man as if he were standing still. The speeds are estimates, but they are a good gauge of animal movements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">On the overland route, one encounters such fleet travelers as the white-tailed deer, the pronghorn antelope and the cheetah. The first of these often attains a speed of fifty miles an hour. You can easily distinguish its identity from the white underside of its tail. However, the visitor will catch only a brief glimpse of this patch of white as its owner turns tail to flash away. The antelope named, recognized from its spurlike pronged horns, can reach sixty miles per hour on the Straightaway. However, it yields its superiority to the even faster cheetah.<sup>1</sup> This spotted, longtailed beast with its powerful, driving leg muscles has been clocked at seventy miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">_ For sea travel, the marine world can hold its owp too. For example, consider the graceful swordfish, so called because of the strange formation of its upper jaw, which tapers away to form a broad, flat sword. It is said to be able to cut through the waves at the rate of sixty miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A veritable dive bomber of the feathered world is the compact duck hawk. It is distinguished by the mustachelike marking at the base of its bill and is said to be capable of hitting 180 miles an hour. The trim-winged swifts have been hailed by many as the fastest members of birddom, though this is a point of controversy. These bird stunt-fliers accompany their speed with extremely graceful movements in flight, cutting their capers with seeming tirelessness. Some of them have been seen looping in continuous perfect circles, and aviators have reported their circling about planes traveling at 85 miles per hour. Swifts are known to travel and feed at 70 miles per hour and this rate can be accelerated to 100 miles an hour apparently without effort. They have been timed flying between 170 and 200 miles an hour. However, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">if the</span><span class="font17"> report concerning the frigate bird is true, it may be the master of the swifts, for it has been said that ship’s chronometers have recorded this creature’s flight at 261 miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Britain has long used some of its feathered aviators for practical aviation purposes. It is by the means of flights of falcons that English airfields are kept clear of the invasion </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of stray squadrons of birds that</span><span class="font17"> wo</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">uld</span><span class="font17"> otherwise menace airplane propellers. The falcons are launched by trainers and immediately soar to great heights from which they swoop with deadly speed and accuracy upon their prey when the lower-flying birds appear. Many will testify that in the course of their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">plunge from altitudes</span><span class="font17"> of 1,000 </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">feet </span><span class="font17">or more downward to their victims the falcons reach a speed of 300 miles per hour. At any rate, regardless of the exact speed, one falcon flight a day is sufficient to clear away all rash would-be idlers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But it is the deer fly, or deer botfly, that is generally recognized as the fastest living thing row known. Most </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">present-day entomol</span><span class="font17">ogists, however, are inclined to be more conservative than Dr. C. H. T. Townsend, who in 1926 estimated this insect’s speed at the fantastic figure of 815 miles per hour.</span></p><img src="g_E_19511122_files/g_E_19511122-16.png" alt="" style="width:310pt;height:115pt;">

<p><span class="font0">old, and by no means perished with Ponce de Leon’s miserable failure to find the &quot;fountain of youth”. Modern De Leons look longingly for restored vigor in the form of hormones. But this is only one avenue used. Experiments with animalkind have convinced some that parent-picking might be a good idea for man as well as beast. With the coming scientific vogue of artificial insemination and transplanted fertilized human ova, selective breeders and eugenists are Having a field day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Selective breeding,”' that is, the purposeful selection of one or both of the parents, has become the accepted method of breeding horses for speed, cattle for meat, dogs for show and, rarely, canaries in assorted colors, etc. Speed on the race tracks, juicy steaks on the table, showy dogs with aristocratic mien and some beautiful canaries in rainbow hues ail testify to the seeming success of the venture. Yes, only “seeming success”, for the observer must squint both eyes, then regard his specimen from just one narrow position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">American speed-bred horses fail in longer endurance tests with many foreign “makes”. The fat, tongue-pleasing cow may leave no heirs or heiresses, due to impeded reproductive ability. And one of the few breeders of technicolor canaries admits that the crossing and inbreeding affects the singing, requiring five generations to get a full-fledged warbler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Behind the “full dress” show dogs lurks further tragedy. This is brought to light by a genuine dog enthusiast, John Reese, in his article “Make My Next Dog a Mutt?’ which appeared in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span><span class="font0"> of December 9, 1950, To emphasize “type”, he laments how the bulldog’s jaw has been so lowered, his nostrils so receded, and his body weight slung so far forward, that he eats and breathes with difficulty, and has little desire for running exercise. Mr. Reese’s own former bulldog was such a victim. Given to a relative who tooli him to Cheyenne, Wyoming, the dog at once proceeded to drop dead of thrombosis. The altitude killed him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>A Family Affair</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Since “inbreeding”, the mating of relatives, plays a vital part in most selective breeding, Mr. Reese took a justified slap at that particular vice, concluding:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Inbreeding is a practice whose effects depend upon certain fairly well-known scientific laws—well known to geneticists, that is. Like most sciences, it should be left to experts. Backyard kennel keepers who breed litter mates justify their recklessness by citing the Pharaoh’s of ancient</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Egypt) who were required by law to marry their sisters, ,That’s my point exactly! Too many purebred dogs today look like the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Intermarriage of relatives, such as cousin marriages or incestuous matings between brother and sister or father and daughter, brings immediately to mind horror and apprehension, along with visions of imbecilic and physically deformed offspring. When and why does this occur? The answer will be found harmonious with the principles of genetics discussed in previous articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These articles pointed out that during maturation of the reproductive cells similar genes become paired. Common defects, like albinism, are usually recessive. As long as one individual carrying a gene for this malady marries someone not carrying it, the offspring may have it in the recessive state, but it will come to no greater prominence than it did in the recessively affected parent. Genes so paired are said to be &quot;heterozygotic” pairs. However, if two persons, each carrying the recessive albinism gene, are married, the genes will likely pair together in what is termed a “homozygotic” union, thus bringing out the defect free of any inhibiting factor to restrain it. Not all members-of a family line, even though the line may be afflicted, will carry the gene. However, intermarriages within the line are much more likely to produce matches that will bring it out than regular outbred unions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some, like the dog breeders, might appeal to the ease of the ancient Pharaohs. However, what evidence have we that there was not a high percentage of mentally or physically malformed individuals in those lines? To the Bible, then, some will go, pointing to the early marriages of Cain and Abel and others to sisters, cousins, etc. But in those early times it would seem reasonable that such measures, then necessary, would have little or no chance of producing subnormal offspring, due to the nearness .of such persons to the original perfection of the human organism enjoyed by Adam and Eve in Eden prior to their rebellion.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Tailor-made Offspring</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The specific study for improvement of the race, particularly the human race, is known as “eugenics”. This consists of a search for means of purging out undesirable or “black” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">genes. Sterilization of </span><span class="font0">individuals carrying such traits, along the pattern of Sweden’s law for sterilizing mental defectives, is recommended. However, authorities argue that eugenic improvement would be very slow at best, since lethal characteristics are usually hidden as recessive qualities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Strict eugenists would have prospective marriage couples first check their genealogies to determine their fitness as a match. Those wise in the experience of living, however, smile understandably at this. In a match between sex attraction and the eugenists, the animal passion is an overwhelming favorite to win. Couples desiring to marry, with other obstacles cleared, are not likely to let a few genes stand in the way. But a little advice at the start cannot do the young aspirants any harm and may make them aware of the seriousness of saying “I do!” They take their life partners for better or worse—genes, chromosomes and aJJ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now some scientists are spellbinding credulous listeners with talk of marrymg whomever you like, yet having children to suit the taste. This springs from the prospective plan of storing spermatozoa in deep freeze units that can theoretically keep it in excellent condition indefinitely —even forever. They say that if the method had come to light at an earlier date women today could be fertilized with the life germ of geniuses of another age such as Shakespeare or Michelangelo. Even fertilized human ova are said to be transferable from one woman to another, where they will continue their normal maturing process until time of birth. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter,</span><span class="font0"> April 21, 1951, testifies with fact and photography to prove it is being done with rabbits, mice, rats, sheep and in the case of at least one calf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This light on one of science's latest &quot;Buck Rogers” exploits was given more elaboration in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pageant</span><span class="font0"> for May, 1951, where the above information was found. Against a backdrop of atomic warfare with its menacing possibilities of mass obliteration of life, the notion is grasped by those &quot;straw clutehers” who fear for the race's very existence. Science fiction has long dabbled with the idea of deep freezing an adult at minus 273 degrees centigrade and leaving him to cool off for two or three centuries, when he could be thawed out at his original age. Since it is not possible to freeze the human &quot;guinea pig&quot; fast enough to prevent crystallization, this variation is science's counter-plan: preserve his offspring instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Still the eugenists would not be assured of an infallible cure for human ills. Women might thus theoretically order the life germ of a genius or a super-strong man; but no one is able to guarantee the positive formation that would be taken to insure the exact &quot;dream child” she fondly envisioned. This practice could provide a &quot;fatherless family” and eliminate for the hard-to-please wife moments of marital blisslessness. However, few women, if any, are expected to embrace such a cold and impassionate substitute for the love and happiness of a mate and a home. Finally, note the object lesson in this: marriage for chromosomes alone, like marriage for money, can offer no sure happiness.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Maternal Myth Explodes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Seeking other ways of producing in offspring certain desired characteristics, many from ancient times till now have trusted in prenatal influence. These columns have on previous occasions presented convincing proof that feelings or experiences of the mother during pregnancy have no effect on the child's traits. (See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> December 22, 1950J Suffice it here to say that Dr. Palmer Findley, author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Story of Childbirth,</span><span class="font0"> classifies this notion with other relics of the Dark Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On this point, too, some choose to derisively chide the Bible, saying that in Genesis 30:37-43 this antiquated theory is championed. But not so’. Briefly, this passage deals with the agreement between Jacob and his father-in-law Laban that Jacob's pay should consist of the spotted and speckled animals in the latter’s flocks and any born thereafter. Though from his actions on that occasion Jacob appears to have believed in prenatal influence, the following chapter, Genesis 31:9-12, makes it plain that Jehovah God gave his servant a lesson in genetics. In a vision God revealed to Jacob that the parent stocks responsible for a sudden abundance of spotted and striped offspring, though plain themselves, carried in their germ cells the hereditary factors for spotted and speckled offspring. This possibility coincides perfectly with the findings of Mendelian heredity, appreciated by modem science for only the last half century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Bible speaks of sin’s entry into the race by the act of &quot;one man”. Consistent opinion of modem geneticists confirms that the male’s role in reproduction is the more important factor. In his book, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Introduction to Modem Genetics,</span><span class="font0"> C. H. Waddington points out, for instance, that the first generation from a cross between</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a scrub herd of females and purebred bulls produced 55 per cent more milk and 44 per cent more butterfat than their female parents. The second generation boosted the margin to 116 and 106 per cent</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font0"> magazine, December 4, 1950, related a “worst bull in Oklahoma’* contest of last November, conducted to exterminate scrub bulls for the general good of the herds. Oklahomans likewise acknowledged that scrub bulls produce scrub offspring even from good cows, while good bulls sire good offspring even from poor cows. Contest entries were faced with the certainty of a “falling star” hour of glory. Their itinerary took them from judging platform to slaughterhouse—from bonanza to bologna!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The Bible Proved Scientific</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Now apply these biological conclusions to humankind. Had the first woman, Eve, alone remained perfect, she would have been helpless to nurture to perfect life the germ of an imperfect man. However, that Adam could have fathered perfect children by a sin-spoiled Eve seems verified in the case of Jesus’ perfect human birth from the imperfect virgin Mary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But surely someone will ask: Since half of Jesus’ chromosomes would have to be supplied by Mary, would he not inherit some of her tendencies of imperfection? Considering the more vital role played by the male in reproduction and that God in this case implanted the life force without using an imperfect man, the answer must be no. Furthermore, remember that not all of the parental genes affect the offspring, but only the dominant ones. Necessarily, perfect genes would dominate imperfect specimens. Thus does fact verify Bible truth and establish faith in its scientific authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In other ages man went globe-trotting after fountains of youth or, seeking race supremacy, employed incest as in ancient Egypt. Today he reaches for hormones to restore vigor or embraces eugenics in the hope of race improvement. In these ways as well as his yet medieval notion of maternal, prenatal impressions, or his current visions of a super race of planned geniuses and strong men via deep-freeze preservation, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font0"> but admits his imperfections and shortcomings. This too the Bible plainly describes—but it also points to the only real way out, promised new fatherhood under God's kingdom rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No worry then of malformed, subnormal children or of gradually weakened family lines. With the restraint of inborn Adamic sin removed, the chromosomes and genes will work as originally intended by their matchless Creator to produce a vigorous, joyful race. Not from deep-freeze units will this spring. Rather the incomparable structure of male and female will coordinate in harmony and in vindication of their Creator’s wisdom. Nor will selfish contests for racial supremacy mar this scene. The “new earth’s” citizens will praise the one true God and his one King, the “Everlasting Father”, and live in complete happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's Witnesses Fanatics?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">NE of the favorite charges hurled against Jehovah’s witnesses is that of fanaticism* According to the dictionary fanaticism is narrow-minded, unreasonable, immoderate and intolerant zeal, especially in religious matters. Let us examine the charge and see whether or not the manner in. which Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their work can be described as fanaticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The charge that Jehovah’s servants are fanatics is not a new one. When the apostle Paul argued his case before Festus and King Agrippa, Festus shouted; “You are going mad, Paul! Great learning is driving you into madness!” But Paul replied: “I am not going mad, Your Excellency Festus, but I am uttering sayings of truth and of soundness of mind.” (Acts 26:24,25, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> Paul was not a fanatic and neither are Jehovah’s witnesses fanatics today. On the contrary, they are open-minded and reasonable, moderate and tolerant. Their speech and conduct is that “of truth and of soundness of mind&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah’s witnesses are open-minded. Theirs is not a bigoted faith and worship. They listen to both sides of a question. They are not afraid to examine the sacred books of other religions but familiarize themselves with the religious teachings of their neighbors, so as to be able to discuss them fairly and intelligently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They have examined the proofs of the authenticity of the Bible and found them valid. From their study of the Bible they have gained an understanding of it that is harmonious and compatible with reason and the facts. Since their conviction that they have the truth, yes, and that they alone are right, is based upon such open-minded study they cannot be charged with fanaticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus was not a fanatic when he stated: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; (John 14:6, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.) </span><span class="font0">such words doubtless sounded fanatical to the prejudiced religious leaders of his day. Neither was Paul a fanatic when he said: “Even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond what we declared to you as good news, let him be accursed?’ (Galatians 1:8, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> Jesus knew whereof he spoke, the apostle Paul knew whereof he spoke, and Jehovah’s witnesses today know whereof they speak. A confidence based upon the Bible, reason and the facts is not a sign of fanaticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nor is the manner in which Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their activity fanatical, even though it may seem strange to many. It likewise is supported by the Bible. The prophets, Christ Jesus and the apostles used the same methods. (Jeremiah 26:1-7; Luke 8:1; Acts 5:42; 20:20) Such methods seem strange only to those who are unfamiliar with their Bibles. But these methods are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">most</span><span class="font0"> effective; they are bearing fruit. To use methods that are at once both Scriptural and effective is not being fanatical, but, on the contrary, is being most practical and reasonable. True, in view of the wonderfulness of their message, and in view of what is involved in accepting or rejecting it, they carry on their activity with earnestness and enthusiasm. And having an unselfish motive gives them freeness of speech. But they neither exert pressure by undue insistence nor do they insult those who disagree with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah's witnesses are not fanatical extremists but are moderate in all things. Christ Jesus foretold the days in which we are living and urged prompt action in view of the nearness of the end of this system of things. See Matthew, chapter 24. To take his words seriously is not being fanatical, but merely displaying true wisdom. Noah was not a fanatic. He merely used good judgment in view of the imminence of the deluge. Likewise Jehovah's witnesses today are not extremists or fanatics, but are showing good judgment in view of the nearness of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even the fact that the end of this old system of things (not of the earth itself) is so near at hand does not cause Jehovah’s witnesses to become fanatical. They do not go to the extreme of withdrawing themselves from society, taking on vows of celibacy and hiding in convents or mon-astaries. Neither do they take themselves or their work so seriously as to neglect their Scriptural obligations toward their families in order to carry on their activity. Nor do they consider their work so important that it provides an excuse for immoral conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are being persecuted in all lands is no evidence that they are fanatical extremists. In a world of darkness and corruption, what else could one expect but that keeping clean and separate from it and letting one's light shine would arouse opposition? Neither is their willingness to suffer a sign that Jehovah’s witnesses are fanatics. Jesus pronounced woe to those of whom men spoke well, but said that all who were persecuted for righteousness’ sake were happy. And is it not far better to suffer bodily pain because of faithfulness to God than to avoid such suffering by compromising and then be plagued with a guilty conscience, such as were the clergy in Germany when Hitler was in power, and as is the case now with many of them in Eastern Germany under the Communist rule?—Luke 6:21-26; 1 Peter 2:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah’s witnesses love their neighbors as they love themselves. They therefore could not be accused of intolerance, for to be intolerant is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font0"> be unwilling </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to grant </span><span class="font0">others what one wants for himself. However being tolerant does not bar one from speaking the truth boldly. Let the people know the facts, and then they can decide for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By exposing the religious leaders of his day as whitewashed graves, as blind guides, as hypocrites, as serpents and offspring of vipers, Jesus was not manifesting intolerance. He did not try to prevent those men from carrying on their worship by physical or legal means. He merely exposed them so that the people could choose whether they wanted to follow such leaders or not. (Matthew 23) The prophets and the apostles had similar messages to give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So with Jehovah's witnesses today. They do not try to prevent others from practicing their religion regardless of how blasphemous, mercenary and hypocritical such may appear to them. But neither do they practice a religious “good neighbor&quot; policy of saying that one religion is as good as another, when they know that such is not the case, for that would be hypocrisy. Exposing false religions may be an unpopular form of worship, but it is not intolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah's witnesses are open-minded and reasonable. They are neither immoderate nor intolerant in carrying on their form of worship. They simply take</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God seriously, take his Word the Bible seriously, and take their dedication to God seriously. They are motivated by love for God and for their fellow man. The expression of such love has not robbed them of all joy. On the contrary, it has made them the most joyful people on the face of the earth, and their joys and enthusiasm continue to increase. Truly to thus benefit from taking God at his word is not fanaticism, but is the very essence of soundness of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Who Will Rule Burma?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Centuries of strife soon to end </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awake!&quot; correspondent In Burma</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">L</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ying</span><span class="font0"> Principally between India, China and Thailand is Burma, about onetwelfth the size of the U. S. A., and having a population of over 17 million. It has desirable, flat, well-watered farm land; a great wealth of forests; minerals and gems —rubies, sapphires, emeralds and garnets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ten million Burmese, racially akin to the Tibetans, form the bulk of the population. Next in number come the Karens, possibly the earliest inhabitants, who the government says number 1,400,000, but whose leaders say total nearly 4 million. The Shans, Kachins and many other smaller tribes also inhabit this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The common language is Burmese. Hindustani is widely used in business. The government uses English, as do many of the better educated. Numerous dialects are also used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tapestry of Burma’s history is interwoven with the glint of sharpened spears and polished-lacquer shields, the thunder of charging war elephants and the boom of jingals, with Talaing, Burmese and other races striving for mastery or local independence. Under their strong King Alaungpaya the Burmese rose to the top in the eighteenth century, only to come under British rule in the nineteenth. With the British withdrawal early in 1948 new contesting groups arose, this time mainly from the Burmese themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Communists raised an armed insurrection. A mutinying section of the Burmese army made an abortive attempt on Rangoon. Another political party threw a large private army into battle against the government. A section of the Karens began a movement toward establishing a separate state of their own, to be called Kawthulay. Formerly there had been sharp strife between the Burmese and Karens in the delta area of Burma’s large Irrawaddy river, and the Karens feared that on the British withdrawal they would suffer at the hands of the Burmese, who outnumber them five or six to one. Tension mounted. These Karens had a defense organization called the KNDO, and in January, 1949, clashes of increasing force took place between the KNDO and Burmese units. The clashes rapidly developed into open warfare., with the KNDO launching a drive on the capital city, Rangoon, from nearby suburbs. KNDO units (later joined by other groups) occupied most of the Irrawaddy delta, not too far from Rangoon, and occupied an area which began 40 miles north of the capital and stretched north to the large town of Meiktila. Here two passenger planes were seized, and, by a bold stroke, some officers and men reached Maymyo, a powerful hill fort to the north, where, by a stratagem, they released and armed a big body of Karen troops who had been interned there. Maymyo fell, and shortly thereafter all the towns as far as the China border, even including the big city of Mandalay, giving the KNDO control of the main trunk line from its upper terminus at Lashio down to within 45 miles of Rangoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile, the Burmese government, which really is a fairly good one by comparison with many others to be seen these days, had not been entirely deserted. Many remained loyal to Thakin Nu. Most important, England stood by him and supplied him with officers and equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Early in April, 1949, MSndalay was recaptured by the government and the tide turned. Maymyo was reoccupied that month. On May 22 the KNDO withdrew from Insein, leaving the government in undisturbed control of the Rangoon district. Since then the government has steadily increased its authority. Toungoo was retaken in March, 1950, after a KNDO occupation of 15 months. Shortly thereafter the trunk road was opened through to Mandalay. The main body of Karen insurgents withdrew into the hills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the end of 1950 the Burmese government of Thakin Nu had control of every city and large town in the country. The insurgents still held a few hundred square miles of land, and sporadic raids were still made on trains and railways, some road vehicles and river boats. Banditry was rife, and even armored trains were not free from attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the Burmese .fighting the religious issue was injected. Many Karens hold to the Baptist faith and respect the Bible, so KNDO leaders have encouraged their men to pray and look to God and Christ for success in their fight, misapplying Deuteronomy 7 and 28 to their cause. On the other hand, Thakin Nu, a devout Buddhist/ claimed that certain Buddhist relics he had sent on a ceremonial tour around Burma by air had “exercised a wonderful influence” on his campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In spite of the fearful beating Burma has taken in nearly ten years of constant warfare, her credit is still good&gt; wages are comparatively high (for Asia), and prices, though high, are not too bad. Yet, consider the lot of the Burmese commoner of whatever racial background. Many thousands who had no interest in fighting have lost their homes, their loved ones or their lives. Villages were ravaged and burned. Millions of acres of beautiful farm land lay fallow, 'while the rest of Asia cried for rice. Millions have suffered. Women in ten thousand homes have dreaded the fall of night, through which the ready arm of a husband or brother would not be present to bar the door against evil men who roved in bands by the dim moon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For better conditions Thakin Nu is quoted by the Catholic paper </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Sower </span><span class="font0">(August 6,1950) as saying, “it is my firm belief that religion is the greatest thing in one’s life, and without religion human life is like a barren desert in which nothing can be grown. In this world ridden with base motives like greed, anger and hatred, religion is the only hope and the slogan for the day should be ‘Back to Religion.<sup>1</sup>’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yet Jehovah’s missionary witnesses show the Burmese peoples that Protestantism, Catholicism and Buddhism have failed to point out that the day is close at hand when the measured tread of armed men, which </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Burma has known for so many</span><span class="font0"> centuries, will no longer shake the fields and valleys. Just one short march, God’s one great final war to forever remove earth’s troublemakers, and eternal peace will descend as a heavenly benediction on Burma as the entire earth becomes the peaceful homestead of God-fearing men who will live in contentment with life forevermore. The kingdom of Jehovah God will then forever rule Burma and all the earth with justice. Such deliverance is at the door!</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Conservatives Win</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; In Britain an election is held whenever the prime minister calls for one, but not more than 5 years apart. The prime minister retains his position only as long as he can hold a majority of votes in the House of Commons. Under Clement Attlee the Laborites have held a majority since 1945, but since the February, 1950, elections this has been very small. New elections (10/25) upset Attlee’s Laborites, who have been responsible for socialism in Britain, and gave a majority to Churchill's Conservatives, who, according to some observers, will probably denationalize iron and steel industries, but retain the socialist health plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Morals in Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Investigations of morals and ethics in government continue to provide a lion’s share of the news. In St. Louis (10/11) James P. Finnegan, former Internal Revenue collector, was indicted on five counts for receiving bribes. In New York the income of Revenue agents was being closely examined. The FBI announced (10/11) it had arrested 120 trusted federal employees in two months, accused of stealing more than $1,000,000 in goods from the armed forces. In .New York the firemen’s shakedown of businessmen who installed fuel oil equipment has been exposed as a $500,000-a-year racket, with ex-First Deputy Fire Commissioner James Moran being indicted (10/15) as the racket's &quot;guiding genius&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Discussing current scandals </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font17"> said (10/22), &quot;It was axiomatic that Harry S, Truman never fired a friend if he could help it,” but that some change was evident when william Boyle, &quot;an old friend from Kansas City,” and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, resigned. It said Truman was &quot;increasingly alarmed by reports that the country was becoming aroused by evidence of unmoral conduct in government and politics”. It would seem to be high time that the people became aroused, unless, as some have suggested, their apathy is because they themselves are dishonest and expect politicians to be the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Severity of Moral Decline</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; When the Senate subcommittee investigating moral standards in government issued its report (10/17) on the flagrant subversion of public welfare in the interest of private gain, it warned that &quot;low standards in the conduct of public affairs are a symptom of low standards in the country generally&quot;, and that &quot;influence peddlers can exist only as long as businessmen or others are willing to patronize them”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Adding his voice to the current outcry of warning, Dr, Robert C. Clothier, president of Rutgers University, warned (10/13) against the 'so what’ attitude of the people when he said, &quot;There is a manifestation of a moral decline among persons in high office and a complacency among us common people to shrug off such revelations as made by the Kefauver Committee. This is the kind of thing which spells internal deterioration, a deterioration which might bring the downfall of America.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Korean Issue Repeats</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$■ The questions regarding the truce talks in Korea have been: (1) Could the talks be held? They were, beginning July 27, (2) Would they be successful? They were not, and were broken off August 23. (3) Could they be resumed? They were, on October 25, Then again the question was, would the new talks be successful? Many observers thought they could not unless a definite change occurred in Korean conditions. The problems that existed before still existed: Where would the truce line be located? What guarantees could be made that the truee would be observed? What new issues would block discussions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Not trusting in the truce talks to end the fighting, the U.N. began some of the fiercest fighting in months. Equipment was issued for another winter in Korea. Chief sufferers, of course, would again be the literally millions of innocent, pitiful Korean civilians who would find no escape from the agonies of malnutrition, starvation, disease and death in the bitter Korean winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Early Korean Accomplishments </span><span class="font17">&lt;•&gt; Despite the &quot;millions of words” printed about Korea, few people know of the early accomplishments of this country, said the October issue of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Natural History</span><span class="font17"> (published by</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">the American Museum of Natural History). The Koreans built the first successful suspension bridge, the first bombs and mortar and developed the first phonetic alphabet fn Asia, They cast movable type for printing In 1403, years before Gutenberg printed his Bible in Europe about 1456. Despite these early developments, Korea's poverty and war-stricken condition today are anything but a “blessing” to this once advanced land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Ambassador to the Vatican</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A flurry of protest arose when President Truman nominated Gen. Mark W. Clark as U.S. ambassador to the Vatican (10/20). The last regular diplomatic mission to the papal state had been cut off by drawing in the purse strings in 1868. (President Roosevelt’s personal representative, Myron C. Taylor, was not an ambassador.) Those who approve the appointment say the Vatican is a good Listening post, or that the ambassador is to the “State” of Vatican City and not to the church it represents. Some who oppose, however, are like Truman’s Baptist pastor, who said, &quot;I would equally oppose a like appointment to the World Baptist Headquarters or the headquarters of any. other religious body.” The National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U*S*A. made plans to combat the nomination. One group for church-state separation said, “The Vatican cannot eat its etike and have it too, It can’t be a church one minute and a state the next.” Clark's appointment is being withheld until </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">congressional action can be </span><span class="font17">taken. However, Congress will probably be caught between fear of losing the Catholic vote and violent Protestant antagonism to such a church-state tie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Still Nd? O1J</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; The great oil refinery at Abadan is deserted. Iran has nationalized the oil, but cannot run the plants and has not reached an agreement with Britain under which British technicians could do the work. Britain raised the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">matter</span><span class="font17"> before the U.N., where the dispute produced a total loss. Iran does not have its seriously heeded income. The British do not have the oil. And, according to the New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font17">of October 8, the U.N.’s “helplessness in the case was held up to the whole world”. There is no doubt that the British Interests profited from the oil, probably at the expense of the Iranians. However, nationalization has not produced the condition </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">many Iranians</span><span class="font17"> expected. Expecting free oil, hundreds have carried bottles and cans to filling stations asking, “It’s our oil now, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Egypt, Britain, and the Suez</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A major British policy has been to protect the “lifeline”, meaning the Suez Canal, that connected the British Isles with the portion of the empire east of Suez, and which is now needed for troop movements. The problem grows more difficult with the current </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fervor</span><span class="font17"> of nationalism in the Moslem states, where rulers see the chance to wipe out all British control and improve their own political standing. At a carefully planned moment Egyptian Premier Nahas Pasha asked parliament (10/8) to annul the treaty with Britain that deals with the Canal area and the administration of the Sudan. Wild demonstrations followed. The British camp at Port Said was attacked. At Ismalia a mob attacked British trucks. Egyptian soldiers fired on a British detail- At each place the British opened fire and attackers were killed. Thousands of British troops were rushed in. Egypt does not have sufficient military might to throw the British out, but riots resulting in Arab deaths could inflame the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">An Empire Dwindles</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Among world governments even the great empires are not stable. Imperial Rome once gave orders. It does so no longer </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Other</span><span class="font17"> great empires have met the same fate. The dwindling British empire is a current example. The “Middle East”, the lands from Egypt to India, have forced the empire to recede from both political and economic control, in the face of violent nationalism. Recent examples are the oil controversy in Iran, the suddenly intensified dispute in Egypt over control of the Sudan and the Suez, and the trouble in Iraq over air bases. However, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the wave</span><span class="font17"> of nationalism has not succeeded in meeting the people's needs, as evidenced by continuing poverty, oppression and hardship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Revolution for Venezuela?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Venezuela had a long history of revolutionary violence in the 19th century, followed by a cruel dictatorship from 1908 to 1935. Its present government is a military junta (a 3-man governing council) which has ruled since it threw out the Acción Democrática party in 1943. A Columbus Day revolt began with an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the junta. Within a few days gun fights had occurred In 16 towns, at least 10 persons were killed, many more wounded, and hundreds arrested. Venezuela is prosperous, but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font17"> magazine (10/22) reported that political instability makes the people grim. Its correspondent reported from Caracas that he talked to the hiding Acclbn Democratica leader, who said </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">that if the government con-</span><span class="font17">tinues to hold all the power, “then it must be revolution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Smoke Is Waste</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; “One of the most exasperating things about the smoke nuisance is its &quot;wastefulness/' said a noted British paper in October. In addition to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">health danger and the grime, Dr, J. Bronowski of the British National Smoke Abate-merit Society recently contended that £50 million spent on modernizing grates in England would save 20 million tons of coal a year, thereby paying for itself in the first year, and making a sizable saving on current fuel supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Blood, Blood and More Blood</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font17"> tremendous blood drive was on in the U.S. in October. Through press, radio, television, posters and magazines the nation was told that the armed forces were running very short of blood plasma, that during the winter U.S. civilians had given about 25,000 pints of blood a week, but that this had dropped to less than 10,000. With the repeated appeals blood donations increased greatly, but had not reached the goal of 75,000 pints a week. The use of blood continues to grow rapidly. The army now uses three times as much blood and plasma for its wounded as in World War X<sup>1</sup>- In contrast with the blood cult’s propaganda, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> has shown the Scriptural viewpoint on the use of blood.—Acts 15: 19, 20, 28, 29; 21: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Color TV Shelved</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Those who have been anxiously awaiting color television or who have been worried lest their black-and-white receivers go out of date will be interested in U.S. Defense Mobilizer Charles Wilson’S request (10/19) that the Columbia Broadcasting System suspend indefinitely its plans for mass production of color television receivers because of current scarcities of materials as a result of war production. C.B.S. announced that its color video broadcasts would be dropped because too few sets were in the hands of the public to make the broadcast worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">What Hope for Mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The lack of ethics Ln goverrt-ment, the implication that the people permit It because they themselves are dishonest, the failure to establish peace, the instability of nations and repeated violations of God’s commands. A look at the world shows all this, and more. A righteous government, a really honest, just, permanent rule is a crying need. But where can such a government be found? Not in unstable human governments preyed upon by corrupt parasites, not even in the U.N., which has ia effect been at war with one of its members (Russia) for, more than a year, Such a righteous government has, however, already been established and, contrary to man’s failures, it will soon extend righteous rule throughout the entire earth. Look, to it. It is God’s kingdom, the sole hope for suffering humanity today.</span></p>
