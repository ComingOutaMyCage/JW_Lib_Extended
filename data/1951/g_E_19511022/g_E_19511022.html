<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Government Force in Medical Treatment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The following l» an article that appeared In the June 27, 1951, Colorado Springa (Colorado) “Gazette Telegraph”. Ite clear-cut vialon In this vital Issue is refreshing to those who champion civil rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">W</span><span class="font0">HERE do the rights of parents in regard to their children end and the rights of the state to take over guardianship of childrep begin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Maybe you haven’t given much thought to that question, although it is one of tremendous importance to every father and mother in the land. It is becoming even more important these days, so far as Americans are concerned, because of the swiftly growing powers of the state over the lives of the citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even in the days of our greatest individual freedom the state had powers over our individual lives which it should not have had. But in recent years these powers have increased enormously and are continuing to increase. Laws which enable the government to initiate force against parents to compel them to send their children to schools which are under the dictation of government are tyrannical laws. They enable the state to take over a measure of guardianship of children, thus invading the rights of parents over their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are other laws which make it possible for government to make children wards of the state, the conscription law, for instance. And the so-called child labor laws. The tendency is toward more and more of this sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another question that calls for deep thought in these days of growing governmental powers over the individual is that of religious freedom. We are guaranteed freedom of worship by the Constitution of the United States, but do we still have that freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is still another question that should have deep thought on the part of all of us, parents and nonparents. This question includes both of those already mentioned and deals with the authority of doctors to prescribe treatment and administer it over the objections of parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We bring up these questions because of a recent court case in Chicago in which the three issues were involved. This was the case in which a six-day-old infant figured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A doctor ordered a blood transfusion for the infant. The parents, members of Jehovah’s witnesses, believe that a blood transfusion is a violation of God’s law, and objected. The state went to court in Chicago in order that the doctors might give the child a transfusion over the parents’ objections. The issue was further complicated later by the denial of the family’s regular doctor that the baby needed a transfusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So here were involved the three points we’ve brought up, the rights of parents, the right of free worship and the power of the medical profession to dictate treat-</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">ment in place of recommending it and ad* ministering it only with the consent of those concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Naturally, the parents in this case loved their child. No one denied this. When arguments were presented to the child’s parents to persuade them to consent to the transfusion the fathet said, “I can’t change, I can’t There is nothing I can do about it. If anything happened to my wife or myself it would be the same.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Just before the hearing in court .the mother said; “Of course I want my baby to live. And I pray, that she does. I’ve always wanted a little girl. But we can’t break Jehovah’s law. He gave us these commands. He told us if we follow them, we will live. If we do not, he will cast us off. We believe it is more important to cany out his commands than to deliberately break them by giving my baby blood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A semimonthly publication, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font20"> published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., reports that the doctor who had cared for the child’s mother during pregnancy was absent on vacation when the infant was born and when the transfusion was ordered. The father, the magazine says, quoted this doctor as saying, the day after the forced transfusion, that he did not think the operation was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Says the magazine about the doctors, “They are always making sweeping statements, telling people how long they have to live, frightening patients into conforming to their remedies. Their mistakes help fill cemeteries, though the graves cover them over. Certainly doctors do much good, but we are not ready to hail them as infallible and bow to their every edict. iTie patient or patients’ parents may still choose their own medicine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the case we’re talking about the parents did rfot “choose their own medicine”. The state' and some doctors chose </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">it for </span><span class="font20">them, despite the rights of parents and the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">We believe it was wrong for the state to interfere with the authority </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font20">the parents in the Chicago case. We believe that it was wrong for the state to interfere with the parents’ religious freedom, and that the doctors who joined with the state in a dictatorial role in demanding that the child receive the treatment these doctors prescribed when the parents objected were wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Incidentally, there was another recent case which received much publicity and in which parents in Georgia refused to believe their child had cancer of the eye as diagnosed, with an operation prescribed. They took their child to the Mayo hospital, where the diagnosis of cancer was refuted. As a result, today this child has 80 per cent vision, which is getting better right along, because the parents had the courage and freedom to decide what medical treatment they wanted their child to received</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">£ An official Catholic position against mob rule was expressed by the pope in his encyclical, &quot;Instruction to Local Ordinaries About the ‘Ecumenical Movement',”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Issued by the supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, February 28, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">1950:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Those who profusely sow the seed of hatred, of discord and of rivalry; those who secretly or openly rouse the masses and provoke rebellions; those who deceive with empty promises the easily agitated masses, even they must understand that the justice demanded by Christian principles, which gives birth to equilibrium and fraternal concord, is achieved not through force and violence </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">but with </span><span class="font17">the application of the law/’</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Economics of Defense and Veteran's Administration Departments</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font29" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T</span><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">tomas Jefferson, one of the founders of the United States, once said: “If we can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of caring for them, they will be happy?' Today enlightened and thinking people are not happy as they note the way in which the government wastes their money under the pretense of caring for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">That the most profligate wasters of the people's money are the military, from top brass to humble draftee, should not seem surprising. Is not their business the destruction of life and property? And particularly as regards the leaders, is not their very education conducive to wastrel habits? Says Senator Chavez, of New Mexico, army and navy cadets at West Point and Annapolis are “educated by the government at a cost of $10,000 a year in an atmosphere where they don’t have to worry about money”. He urged that the future generals and admirals be given courses in taxes and costs so that they would become “mentally conditioned on economy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A striking example of military waste was the “Canol” pipeline, which was to supply petroleum to bases in Canada and Alaska. Be^un in 1942, it took more than two years to complete. Even though experts time and again warned that the project was not practical, in view of its cost, the military stubbornly went ahead with it After $100 million had been spent on it a senate committee called a meeting of top army, navy and WPB officials, and all, except the army, agreed that the project was not worth completing. But the army refused to budge, and spent $35 million more on it. Regarding its usefulness, a government investigating committee reported: “A single tanker during the same time could have delivered twelve times as much petroleum to Canadian and Alaskan bases as Canol actually delivered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">On the “Canol” pipeline as well as on the Alcan Highway the army guaranteed a monthly rental of $775 for tractors costing $8,600, whether used regularly or not, with overtime for more than 240 hours a month; tractors paid for themselves in eleven months or less. Five-ton trucks costing $3,500 drew a rental of $500 a month, paying for themselves in seven months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Other examples of army waste were the $18 million spent on wooden cargo planes, none of .which ever got off the ground, and the loads of winter underwear sent to tropical Guam, which were simply dumped. The army could not be bothered with returning the underwear or shipping it to where it could have been i^ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font20"> JFar Surplus </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Scandal</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Bad as was the waste of the military during the war, such was a mere bagatelle to compare with their waste of the “surplus&quot; after the war. According to the New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font20"> April 26, 1951, the “U, S. Lost 2.8 Billions in Ship Sales&quot;. And, according to a national weekly, $4 billion worth of planes were auctioned off for $6| million, at a fraction of a cent per dollar. One of the fortunate buyers of such airplane bargains got an unexpected dividend of $700,000 worth of 100-octane gasoline that had been left in the tanks of the planes by mistake. What’s a mere $700,000?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">One congressman read into the Congressional record some of the letters he received from soldier boys telling of army waste: of millions of dollars’ worth of lumber being burned for days and days at an army base in the San Francisco area, military guards having no explanation except that It was “orders”; of so many new, not even unwrapped, tires floating along the coast of Alaska that you could have walked on them for 25 miles, thrown into the ocean by the army at a time when tires were extremely scarce in the States; of new radios being smashed and covered by tractors in a southern army camp; of literally acres of army supplies being hauled out of warehouses and dumped into the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">At the close of World War n the army had on hand equipment for 89 divisions, but when it began to rearm it had on hand only enough for 18 divisions. What happened to the equipment for 71 divisions? In many places when the war ended the boys just left their equipment standing where it was and made for the boats. According to the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">U.</span><span class="font20"> 8. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">News and World Report</span><span class="font20">, December 15, 1950, the $50 billion of army supplies, which today would cost $75 billion to replace, “were given away, sold for a fraction of the cost, left to rot or rust in Pacific island jungles, scrapped for junk.” And this in spite of the fact that the “military were put on notice six months after the end of the war as to the seriousness of the international situation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Rearming</span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"> Waste</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Today the civilian economy of the IL S. is being deprived of many essentials and threatened with runaway Inflation, in a mad race to replace the very things that were so wantonly and ruthlessly destroyed five years before, a race accompanied by “staggering waste”, according to former President Hoover. After this race had gotten under way it took a congressional watchdog committee to drive home the idea to the army to stop selling its surplus through one agency while buying </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font20">very same things in the open market through another agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In 1949, although the army was committed by Congress to a stock-piling program, it ignored the pleas of nations in the sterling area to help the market by buying critical materials such as tin and rubber, of which there was a plentiful supply at the time. But a year or so later, the army suddenly went on a buying spree in a rising market, causing prices to double and even treble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">When the draft stepped up induction certain doctors made from $450 to $1,125 per day taking X rays of inductees. It was not until the situation was publicized in the press, in August 1950, that the army proceeded to eliminate this profit-making by getting their own machines. An officer who verified this was penalized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In January 1951 the government had 67 million pounds of powdered eggs on hand. But when the army needed five million pounds it bought them elsewhere, refusing or ignoring the government supply, on some subterfuge or alibi. During the same month two Kansas congressmen vigorously protested the proposal of the air force to build a $37 million air base in their state, as there were six World War II bases available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In recent months the reconditioning of the Sampson Air Force Base, in New York, has come in for much congressional criticism. One plumber foreman received $543 for three days* work, and unskilled labor was drawing fancy wages. Many workmen worked only Saturdays and Sundays and drew overtime rates for doing so. Army engineers justified it all on the basis that it was a rush job. Originally estimated to cost $18 million, latest reports indicate that it most likely will reach $30 million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Men of the V. A,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The top brass of the Pentagon (war department building) trade in fear: “Do you want to risk the security of our country?” Of course, the congressmen concerned with balancing the budget would not think of doing such a foolhardy thing, and so they give the army just about everything it asks for. On the other hand, the veterans themselves have organized a powerful lobby which asks the same congressmen: “Didn't those soldier boys save your country? Is there anything too good for them?” Congressmen, not wanting to be accused of ingratitude, and with an eye to the ballot box, generously grant the veterans* requests. As a result we have an octopus, the Veteran's Administration, which is second only to the Defense department, when it comes to wasting the people's money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">According to the Hoover Commission the V. A. is a scrambled organization topheavy with executives; one unit was found to have 24 supervisors for 25 employees. One of the big jobs of the V. A. is to supply the veterans with insurance. The commission found that 268,000 veterans had paid premiums without being credited^for it, 167,2§9 of which number whose basic records could not even be found- Employees, irritated at the job of transferring records, simply dumped them into trash cans or into the toilets!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A private Insurance company of comparable size took one-seventh as long to pay claims, made six times as many changes of addresses and paid ten times as many death claims per employee as did the V. A. Fifty per cent of all claims were found to be improperly handled or needlessly delayed. Promotions are based on length of service rather than on ability, and 42 out of every lymdred hired quit within the first year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">According to a congressionally appointed investigator: “Some employees not only 'flagrantly* violate rules requiring them to put in a full working day, but they also habitually arrive late, bringing magazines and newspapers so that they can better while away their time. [This] involves al! classes from clerks to lawyers and doctors.** Not least among the profligates wasting the taxpayer’s money are the 24 veteran's associations which have their offices right in the V. A. building, and who pressure and influence decisions in behalf of their members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The V. A. hospital program also wantonly wastes the taxpayer's money. Theoretically these hospitals are built for the purpose of caring for such injuries or ailments as can be directly traced to military service. However, the law says that veterans may be treated for other ailments, if beds are available. Well, the V. A. makes sure that beds are available. In 1949, at a time when V. A. hospitals were only 60 per cent occupied, the V. A. asked for $300 million with which to build scores of more hospitals. President Truman strenuously objected and urged a drastic reduction in the program, but the V. A. lobby and the congressmen in whose areas the hospitals were to be built fought until the $300 million was restored to the budget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The V. A, has upward of 150 hospitals, with 120,000 beds, which cost the government some $650 million annually. V. A, hospitals cost close to $25,000 per bted to build, which Is more than twice what it costs to build nongovernment metropolitan hospitals. An average of 100,000 veterans are treated daily, and 83 out of every hundred cases handled have nothing whatsoever to do with their war service. And to top .it all off, while navy and army hospitals were being closed down, the V. A. was having new ones built in the very same areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Veterans’ Training Waste</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Veterans’ schooling presents another scandalous waste of money. In a big-hearted moment Congress gave veterans a “Bill of Rights”. Included were $500 'worth of schooling and subsistence in the case of unemployment; which subsistence runs from $75 to $120, depending upon the number of dependents a veteran has<sup>-</sup> and upon which he can draw for as many as 48 months, if he was in the army for three years or more. This program cost the government some $2 billion in 1950 and will cost about $3 billion in 1951. Total cost is estimated to reach between $25 and $30 billion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Schools aiming for the veteran’s $500 tuition allowance offer all manner of subjects at all manner of rates. In fact, a number of schools were found to have high rates for veterans and low^rates for nonveterans. Late in July 1951, a report made by investigators of the government accounting office disclosed that the government had overpaid by at least $20 million to schools, because of such dishonest practices, In Illinois, courses in “chicken sexing” (how to determine sex of chicks) cost $500; in Missouri, some schools charged only $40 for the same course. Or, perhaps the veteran is interested in becoming a bartender. It takes seven months to learn the course, as offered by' the Maryland School of Mixology; fee, $500. If the veteran Is unemployed and hits a family, the government is paying $1,340 to teach him to become a bartender!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Some go in for instruction to become dancing teachers. If unemployed what a delightful way to get subsistence allowance! Some veterans who are attending schools which operate only 25 hours a week are receiving $1.20 an hour for studying, via their subsistence allowance. And it Is available to them up to four years, depending upon their length of army service.' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Unless he is disabled, the V. A. offers the veteran little or no help in choosing the right kind of vocation and school Among the more culpable offenders are the photography and television mechanics schools, chief of all offenders being the flight schools. Hundreds of thousands of veterans have enrolled in these flight schools, but only eight per cent of them completed the course. And what are the prospects of these obtaining employment? One large airline has 12,000 waiting for jobs!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">One veteran with 1,500 flying hours to his credit enrolled so as to obtain the subsistence allowance while ostensibly training, Other seasoned aviators enroll but, instead of taking the course, let the school apply the $500 tuition fee it gets from the government toward the price of a plane. Thus the veterans rob the government and the schools rob both the government and the veterans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">To one whose only hope is democracy, such conditions must indeed cause anxious concern. To the Christian, however, who places his trust in God’s kingdom, the Theocracy, such conditions are proof that he is living in the last days of this crumbling old system of things and that soon it will be replaced by a new world of righteousness.—2 Timothy 3:1-6; 2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">By '‘Awake!&quot; correspondent in Nigeria</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">I</span><span class="font20">N THIS twentieth-century “brain agc’\ with all its advancements in science and medicine, many will be tempted to regard witches and the practice of witchcraft as things belonging to medieval times. Witch hunts and trial by ordeal were almost daily occurrences in those days. But there are witch hunts today. Only recently the public press described the nation-wide propaganda drive in the United States against Communist sympathizers as a witch hunt But the kind of witch hunt we are concerned with in this article is more akin to those of medieval times. Its setting is on the “dark continent” of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">According to Bible prediction the final days of this system of things would find men more than ever before “lovers of money”. That being the case it is not surprising that men of depraved minds resort to any and every device to line their pockets at the expense of the credulous people. Can you imagine a racket in which you invest one English penny (1.17 cents) and in a few days realize a return of £4 ($11.20)? Well, that’s the latest racket in Africa, and it all has to do with witches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In recent months a certain body of people called “Atinga” have come into prominence in Nigeria. These people crossed the border from French Dahomey, arriving at the town of Meko. The claim was advanced that they had the power to detect witches. In the course of dewitchment of individuals at their hands fantastic and startling occurrences were alleged to iiave taken place, and fabulous sums of money were being extorted from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So startling were the reports that they gained the attention of the British district officer. In fact, everybody everywhere was talking about the Atingas. On the streets, in buses and traihs, in houses and shops, reports were being circulated about this or that “wonderful thing” supposed to have been performed by the Atingas/ Anyone traveling to Meko or Aiyetoro came back on the same footing as war veterans returning from Burma and Japan at the close of World War II—hundreds of admiring listeners would gather around as he related his experiences. Visitors went streaming down to these two towns, some to consult the Atingas and some to satisfy their curiosity. Transport companies tripled their charges and the cost of foodstuffs became unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">To satisfy our curiosity we decided to make the journey, and see for ourselves what was really happening. Traveling only part of the way, we saw a white mark on the forehead of a passer-by. By this we knew that the Atingas had reached that district; so we stopped off. We soon arrived at Atinga headquarters. A wide circle of people had formed in front of the house. In the center were all kinds of native medicines, gourds, pots, traditional jujus that had been worshiped for generations, all of which had been confiscated by the'Atingas, who claimed that these objects contributed to the practice of witchcraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">On one side of the circle were five old women lying on the ground, their faces turned toward the blistering tropipal sun. Of course, dewitchment cannot be done</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">without torture. That these old folks had already been subjected to violent and brutal treatment could be seen by the fact that the ground had been pounded and smoothed from the friction of their naked bodies. Reports that we heard stated that often Atinga priests pounded such old women with their clenched fists to extort “confessions”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Freedom from this frightful torture was dependent on a money consideration to the Atinga priest, ranging from about </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">£2 </span><span class="font20">($5.60) to £16 ($44.80)—not unlike a similar racket widely practiced in Christendom by which sums of money are passed over to Catholic priests for prayers and masses to release souls from imaginary purgatorial torments; only in this case the torture is real It was learned that under these conditions all kinds of “confessions” of witchcraft were extorted. One “witch” confessed to having killed nine persons by witchcraft, but it so happened that four of them were known to be alive and one was present on the occasion! In another instance two “witches&quot; confessed to having killed the same person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But Jet us scrutinize this racket more closely. The first thing the Atingas do is to ask everyone present whether he has eaten a piece of kola nut. If not, you must </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font20"> into the house, where you will receive one quarter of a kola nut from the chief priest. After eating the nut white clay is placed on your forehead, but only after you have paid the fee of 2/6 (35 cents). This is supposed to make you immune from the power of the witches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Four whole kola nuts can be bought for one English halfpenny (.58 of a cent). So one penny will accommodate 32 persons. At </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">2/6</span><span class="font20"> each, that makes </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">£4</span><span class="font20"> ($11.20). The white clay costs the Atingas nothing. According to one report 440 kola nuts lasted four days* a total intake of £220 ($616.00). If your child or relative is sick you must pay the Atinga priest a consultation fee of 5/- (TO cents) <sub>t</sub> In our presence we heard the Atinga priest tell the patients that their sicknesses were due to the work of witches, and five of them were then and there charged 21/- ($2.94) each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Law Steps In</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">On the statute books of </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Nigeria</span><span class="font20"> (Section 210b of the Criminal Code, Cap. 42) we read: “Any person who—(b) Accuses or threatens to accuse any person with being a witch or with having the power of witchcraft, is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment for two years/<sup>1</sup> On arrival of the district officer at Aiyetoro the Atingas were officially advised that their work was illegal, and they were ordered to leave the town. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">They</span><span class="font20"> arrived at Haro. The oba (king) of Haro was officially informed that their work was illegal, so he withdrew consent for the Atingas to work in the town. The townspeople, having been persuaded that their ailments were caused by witches and that the Atingas could deliver them, brought pressure to bear upon the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">oba,</span><span class="font20"> About 300 people mobbed him, and he was compelled to fiee to his palace. In </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">the evening over </span><span class="font20">1,000 hysterical mobsters attacked the palace, sticks and stones were thrown at </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">the oba</span><span class="font20"> and he had to take refuge in an inner chamber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The following day a big gathering was held and the people declared themselves immovably determined that the Atingas should be allowed to work. A council meeting convened and the council weakly succumbed </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">to the pressure of</span><span class="font20"> the mob and gave their consent In the course of these demonstrations and riots 104 persons connected with the Atingas were arrested and jailed. The religious affiliations of these people have been listed and are interesting, showing that the Atinga racket Is not something confined to illiterate pagans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The 104 persona were made up of 69 Mohammedans, only 10 pagans, and, If you please, 25 “Christians”. Of these (including four “Christians”) twelve have now been charged with the murder of an old woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The public press reported further acts of violence In connection with Atinga witch hunts. Three Atingas were expelled from the railway town of Oshogbo and fled to Ola, where many women were in* timidated and tortured to confess that they were witches. Two police were sent there but were mercilessly beaten and chased out of town by the demonized Atinga supporters. More police were dispatched and caught the Atingas at work demonstrating their method of detecting witches in the presence of the chief. Chief and Atingas were arrested and criminal charges have been preferred against them </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">(Daily</span><span class="font20"> Service, January 25,1951, issue). According to the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</span><span class="font20"> of February 1,1951, thirteen Atingas were fined various sums amounting to £69-10-0 at the Ikeya magistrate’s court for unlawful assembly and assault and of accusing 19 aged women of being witches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Undoubtedly the demons are pushing the Atinga racket as a means of terrorizing and exploiting the credulous population. Village after village and town after town invite the Atingas to come to them. The fee demanded depends upon the size of the village. A small village must contribute £60 ($168.00), while a larger place as much as £350 ($980,00). Many of the people live in dirty, unhygienic surroundings and drink bad water, but they prefer to attribute their ailments to witches, and pass over their money to the Atinga racketeers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But some are beginning to realize that despite the many Atinga “dewitchments” in the area, their ailments persist. Among these are found some of good will toward God who, learning the truth, are tumipg to the one and only cure-all, Jehovah’s new world of righteousness, soon to be established here on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">HEN an ant looks up at a man, if the tiny creature has any thought at all, it must be that the whole world begins and ends right there. If the man is not particularly concerned over what becomes of the ant, this reasoning will likely prove at least half right. The world will end right there—for that ant. Ah, but when a man looks straight into the eye of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a full-grown elephant, what then ? Wilf not much of the man’s future happiness depend upon how the elephant feels? Should the powerful pachyderm not think the man indispensable to society, a mere sweep of the long prehensile trunk, a butt from the massive head, a gore with the sharp tusks or a few gentle pats by the great front feet, and the expendable one will be eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only by utilizing all of his mental alertness and by arming himself with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">powerful </span><span class="font3">hunting guns has man proved any match for the elephant. Even then, when best equipped, man is the only source of fear and watchfulness to the mighty king of beasts. “King of beasts&quot;—yes, despite unwarranted propaganda to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">contrary </span><span class="font3">favoring the lion. Other animals, without the mentality of either man or elephant and with nothing near the elephant’s might, can offer no formidable challenge to the mighty monarch. A closer examination of the elephant’s possessions only shows why this should be true. Since even mature adults can be tamed in a remark-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Elephant Is Very “Nosy”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Starting with the feet, the elephant from the ground up does everything in a big way. A large African specimen may have a forefoot boasting a circumference of sixty-eight inches. The underside is soft and picks up foreign objects easily. Regu-lar cleanings contribute to greater w</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">alkin</span><span class="font3">g comfort. Powerful ankles near the ground make the elephant a much better climber than the horse. Ordinarily, of course, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font3">horse enjoys superiority in running, since the elephant’s ponderous body structure will not permit more than two feet to leave the ground at once without </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">dang</span><span class="font3">er of capsizing. The result is a very singular shuffle effect. But when terrified, the ponderous pachyderm musters an unaccountable speed that, combined with the weight he can add to any situation, makes him the terror of the jungle. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Beyond all hope </span><span class="font3">is the man or beast caught in the path of an elephant stampede!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some foolish Jaymen might </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hastily</span><span class="font3"> conclude that tracking anything as large and</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">usually as slow-moving as an elephant would be child’s' piay. The elephant can anord to smile inwardly at such folly* Elephants “follow the leader” in strict order, stepping in the very prints of the one before them. In this manner a single herd can sink holes quite deep, and the rains fill them with water. Following tracks like that dll day will try the legs of any man. Also, despite his heft, at the they will be considerably smaller. The head dips, giving the nervous intruder an unwanted head-on view of two gleaming ivory tusks. Each of these will average the weight of a man, from 150 to 180 pounds apiece, in many cases. Record breakers over 200 pounds are known. You will sympathize to learn that carrying around such a load can be quite tiring. Frequently an elephant will rest his head in the fork of a tree to</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">sudden flash of a plunging tiger, the Asiat-take this load off his mind. Otherwise, he</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">ic elephant is said to whirl as quickly and silently as a ballet dancer. When necessary either the Asiatic or African kind can slip through a thicket without so much as snapping a twig. An inexperienced huntsman, not hearing any noise, might believe his quarry far ahead of him. Imagine his surprise when a gigantic bull elephant might decide to call his bluff, double back and confront him face to face at the top of a hill! It is the hunter’s move next. But, frankly, what would you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">This would hardly be the place for collecting technical data; but if he felt inquisitive enough, the young adventurer might calculate that the beast’s height at the shoulders is about twice the circumference of the forefoot, ft the particular specimen is an African the back will be about level from head Asiatic, two noticeable knobs will dominate the forehead and a de^ pression will be found behind the shoulder blades. This rises in a modified hump effect to a high point in the back’s middle* Shaking his head at the not especially welcome visitor, the elephant, if an African, will display great spreading ears; if an Oriental, may lean his entire body against a stout tree, or even lie down completely, perhaps using an anthill for a pillow*</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font20">to tail. If it is an</span></p><img src="g_E_19511022_files/g_E_19511022-10.png" alt="" style="width:283pt;height:263pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">The elephant’s hesitancy at the sight of the hunter at this moment might be due to some curiosity of his own* The elephant is truly a very &quot;nosey” fellow. In fact, his nose is probably his most obvious feature. Commonly called the trunk, it is a vital organ to the elephant, containing about 40,000 nerve endings. Humans who are “ticklish” can imagine how the elephant feels when some ants stray into the end of his prominent proboscis! The trunk is “Jumbo’s” vital attachment, and he is very “attached” to it. He breathes with it, smells with it, gives love pats and kisses with it (the latter by placing it in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">female’s mouth), scolds with it, wallops with it, uses it to uproot one-ton trees or to pluck a blade of grass by means of the delicate fixture on its end. It is an antenna of sorts, detecting the nearness of friend or foe; and when he chooses to saunter along a river bottom, the trunk protrudes above the surface in the manner of a submarine periscope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">JVoi </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Handsome, but Brainy</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There he stands, from three or four to </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">six </span><span class="font20">or seven tons of jungle giant. This behemoth does not claim to be handsome. His profile is not aided by the hanging nose effect, and his skin hangs loosely on him In the manner of an Inexpensive suit of clothes after exposure to a rainstorm. But when he wishes to combine his brawn with brains for a venture, the elephant needs no business partner. He is as shrewd an individual as will be found anywhere in the animal realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Martin Johnson once observed a herd charging upon a river. Rather than recklessly plunge into the current, they first paused for a very serious huddle discussion. Then they proceeded to cross the stream in the most logical manner available. In the Orient elephants are used prevalently for work, and they have produced the Eastern version of the &quot;machine age’*. In the most scientific way, they can work a log jam free, almost sensing which Is the key log, then jumping free in time to avoid the crash of the suddenly loosed logs. When a herd of elephants is grazing a distinct bowel rumble is audible for a great distance. Hunters can hear this. However, by that time or before, the elephant has smelled the hunters, and will promptly &quot;shut off&quot; the rumble. It is well they can do this, for daily they spend many hours eating in an effort to fill their great internal cavity. Enormous grinding teeth care for the great chewing job required. Describing an unusual system of &quot;built in*’ dentistry possessed by the elephant, the June, 1934, issue of </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">National Geographic</span><span class="font20"> adds: &quot;These huge molar teeth thrust upward and forward exactly in proportion to the wear on their crowns; so that when the tooth is worn down and useless it is pushed to the tip of the mouth and falls out. . . . Six of these molars, or cheek teeth, pass thus through each jaw on each tfde of the mouth. Thus the elephant in his lifetime uses 24 teeth/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The elephant’s usual courtesy and consideration for the “sanctity of the home&quot; properly fall under the heading of the beast’s intelligence as well. Consistently, even wild herds will usually not maraud a native village, though no guarantees can be made'for the food supplies in the fields. Occasional “rogue&quot; or outlaw elephants, however, can be very troublesome. In an unaccountable fit of distemper, or because maddened from a wound, such &quot;public enemies&quot; will forsake a herd and depart on a life of crime. They are the contempt of their fellow elephants as well as of humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">To show how considerate the normal elephant is, there is the verified story of the circus elephant which, while foraging for food near a circus lot, unwittingly upset a bird’s nest. With infinite delicateness, the massive monster replaced each scattered part with its trunk and restored the nest to the order in which he had found it. Then, with unbelievable gentleness, he backed away from the scene as if tiptoeing out of a nursery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Such pachydermic poise is not wasted. Not- all Oriental elephants are employed for menial labor. On festive occasions, they are seen in formal processions, adorned in the finest trapperies and wearing a king’s ransom in jewels. Frequently, even the tusks are sheathed in gold! In the open royal court, they take their places, come forward at the designated time, add their part to the celebrations by blowing beautifully colored flowers in the air, and &quot;curtsy&quot; before the ruler with incredible finesse. Their poise in circuses is well known and also demonstrates how they can be trusted with the safety of humans, even young children, their special delight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">AffcdUef and </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Make-Believe</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There are almost endless examples of </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font20">elephant’s thoughtfulness and consideration that reflect a high intelligence. Not unlike some other animals, elephants live by the code: “Never let a pal down/’ When one Is wounded by hunters’ guns, others will return even in the face of death, take their positions at either side of the wounded fellow and nudge him off into the jungles. Even in wild herds, the aged and inflrm members of the society are not cast off to shift for themselves, but the others continue to care for them. Parental love is outstanding and females will even take any orphan baby elephant and rear it. But early in life the babies betray the elephant sense of humor. They will hide in brush and emit loud cries. The mother rushes over, only to be met by the baby, which dashes out and butts the unsuspecting parent in the stomach!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But the juveniles are not the only mischievous delinquents. Adult examples are more sly but just as plentiful. If bothered with a cold or stomach cramps, attendants will usually give tame elephants a bucket of gin and ginger (a potent “cocktail” that only the elephant constitution could survive to describe). The elephant finds that such “medicine” truly hits the spot. The next day he feels much better but is as dry as ever. A convenient sneeze or agonized moan Is in order to signal a return of yesterday’s malady. The indulgent trainer responds with more of the same. But after a few days of this the most gullible trainer senses the ruse and cuts off the supply lest he have a confirmed alcoholic on his hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In a reverse way, Eastern elephants fcvoid the distasteful pills given them for heat stroke. Catching the bitter taste through the sugar coating, they hide the tablet in their jaw, reasoning that if the pill is spit out, the watchful </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">mahout</span><span class="font20"> will </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">call for help to force others down the hapless beast’s throat The», at an opportune moment, he will remove the pill with his trunk and blow it backward over his body and far away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Perhaps the “Jumbos” feel such mischief is only recompense for the fables credulous men have passed off concerning this royal monarch. The big one’s bulky sides literally shake with mirth to hear repeated the yarn that elephants are afraid of mice. Aren't they really? “No!” the big head shakes definitely in the negative. In fact, some elephants have even been trained to let mice run along their trunks to disprove this myth. Contrary to popular opinion, though, the thick, loose skin is highly sensitive, and ants and mosquitoes can plague the poor giant to distraction. This is probably one reason for “Jumbo’s” many shower baths via his trunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Biggest Rumor of AU</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Most noted of all elephant legends is the tale that for generations the great beasts have, by instinct, left their herds as death drew on and proceeded to a mammoth valley making up a great elephant cemetery. With their last breath they are said to heave themselves over the precipice into the chasm below as their last cries send jungle life for miles around scurrying to cover in tribute and fear. For years scientists and explorers, spurred on by the careless assertion that elephant remains dead of natural causes were never found in the jungles, sought such a place In the hope of fabulous treasures in ivory. About the time all stock in the theory was about to be abandoned, an aged native would show up with the tale that he had once seen the graveyard. But he would always turn silent when it came to divulging the location to white men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Actually this hoax is based on a fallacy. Elephant remains are found regularly in the jungles, though not in proportion to which they die, Answer to this is reasonable. The bones are quickly picked clean by the many forms of life about, and the flourishing vegetation covers the skeletons in short order. Many others are to be found in river bottoms, and the following from </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Our Dumb Animals^</span><span class="font20"> of December, 1931, seems to climax the story. After relating that herds probably have their own burial grounds, the article adds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">‘'This is always a swampy tract of land overgrown with trees and rank vegetation. Here he dies, and his great body buries itself by its own weight in the soft soil. Many of these elephant graveyards are known to the African hunters, who make journeys to them each year for the purpose of digging up the ivory tusks. Few white men have ever seen such a place, for the natives know that an elephant graveyard is as valuable as a gold mine, and they keep the secret.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But debunking such fables detracts: nothing from the magnificence and wonder of the jungle’s king. To watch an elephant stampede thundering through the jungles, the leader trumpeting the commands, his or her ears spread widely, trunk straight out before him, the earth- trembling beneath them, all life scattering to the sides in front of. thern<sub>;</sub> one can scarcely believe that this same beast is the most quickly trained for peaceful work and entertainment. Yet there is the living evidence, the silent, contented giant of the circus grounds, calmly entertaining small children, balancing on hind feet, swinging girls from his trunk. He seems quite happy —after all it isn’t a bad life. Why, he even gets weekly manicures, or perhaps we should say pedicures, his toenails filed and feet cleaned of aggravating perspiration. And he has not relinquished his crown. His power and prestige are knowh everywhere. He is the biggest thing on feet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">With </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">th&amp;</span><span class="font17"> sea stickleback, 'man's place is in the home’—and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">a home that</span><span class="font17"> is very temporary and not given to showing him much appreciation at that. Never hearcfof a stickleback? The weird little fish is not common. It dwells off the coasts of Britain and Western Europe, and spends its life swimming with its characteristic little jerky motions in the sea or large estuaries. When at rest, and probably for protection, the stickleback will /©sort to the stems of weeds and sea growths that it so closely resembles in color. There the crafty fellow will pose, head downward, reaping the benefit of virtually perfect camouflage. Birdlike, the stickleback builds a nest amid the sea plants when it wishes to “settie down”. Be it noted that the male performs this task, and it is he, as will </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font17"> seen, that is the true upholder of home life among the sticklebacks. The nest is sewn together by means of a thread secreted from the external opening of the stickleback’s kidney duct. As the fish passes in and out amid the materials it has assembled for the nest, thread trails behind and binds the walls in one. The home finished, the male simply awaits the arrival of a partner to share it, having no need of the aggressive conquest method usual to his sex in other life forms. Nor is he an “easy catch”. At the female’s first appearance (it is spring!) the male greets her belligerently with a barrage of biting. However, the egg-loaded female is not to be lightly shoved aside, and when the male sees her true Intentions, he mellows, Then his bites become mere love nibbles as he assists her into the nest,- then joins her there. The female’s eggs, once fertilized, she is content to leave in the nest which she now forsakes forever. The male fans them with water to supply oxygen and cares for the young when hatched. Then the sea scatters his family and the patient male starts again from scratch.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth.”—Acts 17:24,26, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Accounting for the foregoing, along with all the differences existing among men, is this very important fact about human genetics: all members.of all human nations inherit at birth sin and imperfection. Because of this the appearance 1900 years ago of the Messiah was history changing in nature. Commenting on this, the apostle Paul wrote afterward that it was God<sup>f</sup>s will that “all kinds of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth”. (1 Timothy 2:4, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">It will be well to bear this in mind while considering the many other things about man that geneticists, those experts in heredity, have at their disposal. The same principles uncovered in the study of plant and animal life will apply in human heredity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Assisting this process is the fact that dominant genes (genes are the carriers of</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Genes Make the Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Minute panicles in the eye’s iris will reflect blue light unless obstructed by a brown pigment, which, according to its density, will produce light or dark-brown, green or gray eyes. Brown is dominant to blue, and two blue-eyed parents could even, theoretically have a brown-eyed child. This could occur if one parent had a brown gene that in himself had been renressed due to some inhibiting factor not pass^n nn cniia. Though it appears an incredible exception to the rule, it would be unwise to say that two brown-eyed parents absolutely cannot' have a blue-eyed child. Hooton, in his work </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Up from the Ape.,</span><span class="font20"> even cites record of a dark-skinned tribe phenomenally marked with blue eyes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Concerning defects, susceptibilities, allergies, etc., geneticists keep supplying ready answers. Eye defects like myopia (shortsightedness, in which optical structures cause the eyes to focus on nearby </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">objects </span><span class="font20">while </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font20">rest) are attributed to gene action. Allergies may come from foods, pollen, or simply dust from hair. One authority lists among signs of such allergies hay fever, asthma, eczema, edema, hives and migraine. Such action is attributed to a dominant -or irregularly dominant gene, and it is claimed that members of a family may carry the same gene yet be allergic to different things. Hereditary influence is attributed to longevity as well as to the ace affliction, cancer. The latter often recurs </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">among members of the </span><span class="font20">same family at about the same age. But it is consoling to remember that an inherited tendency toward a disease does not necessarily mean the disease will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Two mentally defective persons marry. With monotonous consistency they produce subnormal children. Outright insanity takes a number of forms. Dementia praecox or schizophrenia, expressed by lack of interest in things about you, incoherent thought and action and delusions, Alls more than half the space in insane asylums. That it is inherited seems to be accepted; how is another questiop. Action by more than a single pair of genes is thought involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">And just as feeble-mindedness is Inherited, so, in degrees, is intelligence. But many other factors enter in here. Opportunity and environment appear to play important parts in giving expression to one’s inherent ability. But given the slightest chance, intelligence will show itself above the crowd. With regard to special arts, such as musical ability, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Liszt and Weber were produced by families noted for the talent. Apparently genes make the man. But at that their work is not through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Why the Roces?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Genetically, the races can be divided according to the frequency of certain genes</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In their make-up. In his authoritative book, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Genetics and the Races of Man,</span><span class="font20"> published just last year, Dr. William Boyd lists them accordingly as Early European, European, African, Asiatic, American and Australian. From their names the locality for these will be obvious. It will be necessary only to point out that Dr. Boyd’s map indicates an area between France and Spain as the heart of his “Early European** peoples; and that the inhabitable part of Greenland is assigned to the American division. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Iceland is European.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But the average layman is not so much interested in the technical discussion of what races are as in how the different ones came to be. </span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">Frequently </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Aw</span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">ake!</span><span class="font20"> </span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">receives questions from readers regarding tKi</span><span class="font20">T </span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">point and inquiries as to whether the B</span><span class="font20">i</span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffle gives answe</span><span class="font20">r. The Bible does trade the post-flood repopulating done by Noah’s three sons, and it tells of the rise of languages on the plains of Shinar. However, ous definite ^characteristics marking the the Bible nor science or any other source on earth can answqjr concisely. However, on page 192 of the previously mentioned book, Dr. Boyd grovides a^scieqyfis^ swerjhat, while not telling how the races came, at least gives logical reasons for not knowing. What we have already discussed on genetics in general in this and previous issues should be sufficient to understand this technical explanation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“The independent assortment of chromosomes in inheritance and the possibility thaj^genescancrossjoverbe^eenpairs</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">jgon. In a population of ‘mulattoes,’ for instance, it would be quite impossible to deduce the skin colors of their forebears, who might have been 'pure' white and ‘pure’ Negroes, or—mulattoes! Any types of mankind with differences pronounced enough really to constitute races must in most cases differ in a number of genes. ... In a mixture of two or more races, Independent assortment and crossing-over would soon mix up these genes to such a degree that it is very unlikely that any ancestral type would emerge, except perhaps very rarely, in a population descended from such a mixture.'*</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">This authority and others testify to the relatively minor differences among the races. It is known, of course, that, unlike different natural species, the races frequently intermarry with little obvious difficulty, (Though some say this may occasionally provide some disharmonious combinations of characteristics in the offspring.) Boyd cites authority for the belief that the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">characteristic</span><span class="font20"> differences between the white and the black races may be as little as only six pairs of genes. C. H. Waddington, In </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">An Introduction to Modern Genetics,</span><span class="font20"> modifies this somewhat with the belief that the difference from the South Africans may be but a few genes, while from the West Africans it is a case of difference of many genes. Dr. Boyd offered his own belief that the difference was probably a little greater than the figure of his authority but that it was proportionately very slight, then adds that “any outraged conviction that the difference between the two races must be much greatefc than this, which some persons might feel, ^^j^op^faetors. ... An inherited difference becomes vital as marking off a race only when someone chooses to treat it as vital, as Hitler did with the Jews in Germany, or as some individuals in the United States have chosen to do in the ^ase of the Negro”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chromosomes and World Domination</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Hitler followed his “master race” fanaticism to defeat and death. But with his claims no more than burled, the world shudders at the cries 'of today’s would-be “supermen” of the Soviet. Among many idolized Soviet “heroes” is the revered Ivan Michurin, who died in 1935, His laurels under, Russian communism were won through his championing the now-antiquated genetics theory, once hailed by evolutionists, that acquired characteristics can be inherited. This dovetails beautifully with the Marxist line that an eventual “dictatorship of the proletariat” will surround man with ideal environmental circumstances and weed out practically all of his undesirable characteristics. An enthusiast once even wrote that someday under communism mankind would discover the way to eternal life! Present Russian claims to 30,000 persons over 100 years of age within the Soviet were severely doubted by genetics authority Amram Scheinfeld. However, in a manner devastating to the Red “ideal environment” theory, Scheinfeld concluded a letter to the New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font20"> with this thought: “The greater the state of ignorance and illiteracy anywhere the greater will be the number of persons reported to be aged 100 or over.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Michurin’s current “heroic” successor Is one Professor T. D. Lysenko. He has been greatly favored by his government, a government that, during a Red “biological purge” in 1948, ousted the core of legitimate modem Russian geneticists. Of course, outside of Russia, Lysenko’s wild ideas have been universally denounced. And even within the homeland, ripples have appeared on the surface. An anonymous Russian tabbed him “the Rasputin of Soviet biology”. Moreover, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Time,</span><span class="font20"> January 1,1951, reports that the Russian magazine </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Life</span><span class="font20"> has dared to lift a questioning voice in its demand that all scientific theses be subject to review, even Lysenko’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But in the meantime, continued Russian arrogance makes the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">biological front a </span><span class="font20">center of increased attention in the East-West division. Delivering an address at Columbia University’s MacMillan Theater on November 15, 1950, Nobel Prize winning philosopher Bertrand Russell warned that genetic competition might add a grim new phase to the international armaments race. He talked of the possibiEfies of scientific breeding of humans after religious and emotional obstacles had been overcome. He pointed out that if Russia overcame these and went ahead with the program of breeding “a race stronger, more intelligent and more resistant to disease than any race of man that has hitherto existed”, the other nations might feel forced to do likewise or risk later military defeat, Thus, by a strained expression, we might say that some men foresee the stockpiling of chromosomes along with their atomic stores in their effort to survive the present hectic world crisis over the all-out bid for world domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible Survives the “Supermen”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">How vain to exalt one race or nation above another! Consistent, reputable findings concerning the minor differences among races, much less among nationalities, doom to utter disappointment the dreams of Soviet &quot;supermen”. Unfortunate in the other extreme are the many sincere persons who devote their entire lives to the work of eliminating all discrimination and inequality among races. Another superior force alone will ever wipe out all such evils from the earth. This will be the power of the Great Potter, Jehovah God, who formed from clay the original ancestor of today’s &quot;all kinds of men”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But, you say: 'Only the Bible tells about that, and scientists on both sides of the iron curtain seem to have little or no faith in it* True, but they are without excuse in this, for where it discusses scientific matters it nas proved consistently true and has verified the findings of true science. Where science disagrees point blank with the Bible, it has likewise been unable to prove its theories by any positive source. Do not forget, too, that God’s Word of warning proved true in the time of the Nbachian </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">flood,</span><span class="font20"> at </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">which time</span><span class="font20"> d race </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font20">hybrid &quot;supermen” bred by the intermarriage of materialized angels with women perished. (Genesis, chapter 6) They had thought themselves strong enough to scoff and get away with it. For the good of all, though with little regard for the sky-high vanity of a &quot;superman”, the Bible says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;For ‘all flesh is as vegetation, and all its glory is as a flower of the vegetation; the vegetation becomes withered, and the flower falls off, but the word spoken by Jehovah endures forever’.”—1 Peter 1:24, 25, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Do those who £boff at the Bible’s account </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">of man’s origin have a eounteran-</span><span class="font20">swer they can positively prove? No, but they leave listeners out on the proverbial limb, not even daring to positively account for the origin of races. Simply because the Bible denies something that scientists themselves cannot prove, is it to be considered untrustworthy? Without the Bible men can only be left to struggle on in the dark, with their race supremists on one hand and their race reformers on the other. With it sincere Christians today have a living hope in an impending new world society. Thereby all evils and oppression will be eEminated and replaced by an earth where righteousness shall dwell along with those from among &quot;all kinds of men” who show that they want it</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">M</span><span class="font20">ANY persons were surprised when they read in the March 15, 1951, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font20"> that Jehovah ’&amp; witnesses had scheduled a district convention at Verdun Auditorium, Verdun, Quebec, a suburb of Montreal, for May 25 to 27, After the amount of difficulty and persecution Jehovah’s witnesses have had in Quebec in recent years</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19511022_files/g_E_19511022-11.png" alt="" style="width:244pt;height:245pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">solicitor-general of Quebec, Antoine Rivard, is reported as “vehemently denouncing Jehovah’s witnesses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Verdun Takes</span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"> Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The lawyer for the City of Verdun is also a leading Knight of Columbus; so two days after the above meeting of the “Knights” the Verdun City Council passed a</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">the question would come to mind, Could fi such a convention be held? The very I thought of such things was a bitter pill for the Hierarchy-inspired officials of Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">On May 23, only two days before the convention, the Montreal newspapers reported that Mr. Justice Surveyer of the Superior Court had issued an injunction, which is a court order, forbidding the convention in the Verdun Auditorium, The building had been rented to the Society months in advance of the convention for the dates specified, May 25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">’ When intensive advertising and preparation began in April announcing Mr. N. H. Knorr as the principal speaker, Boman Catholic organizations began to bring pressure on the City Council of the City of Verdun to stop the assembly. A group known as the “Young Catholic Workers” (called J.O.C.) distributed a leaflet (in French) with a scare headline entitled “Verdun in Danger”. It made a lot of ridiculous and senseless allegations against the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Next the Knights of Columbus got started. At a special meeting held in Quebec city on May 6 they discussed the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. Judge Fabio Monet of Montreal spoke against Jehovah’s witnesses. At the same meeting the</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">resolution telling the operators of the auditorium that the assembly could not be held. However, immediate application 1 was made by Jehovah’s witnesses to the superior court at Montreal for an injunction to force the contract to he respected. On May 17, Mr. Justice Smith issued an injunction or court, order directing the operators of the auditorium to have it opened to the witnesses from midnight May 24 to midnight May 27 with full rights to hold the convention without interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">This order was a great blow to the City of Verdun. If they desired to upset it, the only legal move would be a motion to quash the injunction. But, of course, such a proceeding would require that notice be given to all interested parties and a fair hearing be had in open court Such a concept of justice makes it difficult for those trying to abuse the process of law. So instead of notifying anyone the city attorney went alone before Mr. Justice Surveyer, a French Roman Catholic, and got a second injunction prohibiting Jehovah’s witnesses from holding their convention; this on May 23, with the convention due to begin on the 25th. Moreover, May 24 was a general holiday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The legal position caused by the second injunction created a situation unprecedented in the history of English law. The injunctive order of Mr. Justice Smith on May 17 gave Jehovah’s witnesses the right to unimpeded possession of the auditorium for the three days of their convention. Anyone who tried to stop them would be in contempt of court. The order of Mr, Justice Surveyer said exactly the opposite. If Jehovah’s witnesses tried to go in, they would be in contempt of the second order. If the city tried to keep them out the city would be in contempt of the first. Yet both injunctions were equally valid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Caught Red-handed</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Watchtower Society’s attorney found out about this secret injunction late in the afternoon of May 23 and immediately addressed himself to the chief justice of the superior court to ask for a hearing on the matter. It was pointed out that to have two injunctive orders of Judges of the same court, each ordering the opposite to be done, was impossible and must be settled at once. The chief justice is a man of integrity and respect for the law, and it was possible to arrange special hearing for May 24, in spite of its being a holiday. The trial was before Mr. Justice Surveyer, asking him to quash his </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font20"> injunction. Having no case, the lawyers for the city tried to bluff their way by yelling, irrel-evancies and bad manners. In the latter they showed marked ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The injunction of the city was founded on statements contained in a petition and verified by affidavit of a civic official who said he had read the petition and that it was all true. On cross-examination it was admitted he had not even read the petition. In fact his affidavit was sworn on May 22 and the petition which he swore to be true was not even drawn till May 23. When questioned about the facts contained in the petition he denied virtually every paragraph. His sworn statement said the city would suffer a loss of $4,300 from the convention. When asked how this amount was computed, he could not think of a single way in which the city would suffer any loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">It was shown on behalf of the Society that people were coming from all parts of Quebec and Ontario as well as northern New York state to be at the assembly; that extensive preparations had been made and a great deal of money spent; that similar assemblies had been held all over Canada without causing any trouble to anyone, so there was no excuse for trying to stop this one. Among other things Justice Surveyer made the very unjudicial remark that Jehovah’s witnesses are a “scourge” that must be endured. The judge, even though dealing with a hotly contested and important case that was being reported on the radio from coast to coast, dozed off on several occasions during the hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">When the argument was over the judge was asked to give an immediate decision, because, according to contract, the hall was to be open for pi'epara</span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">turns that night </span><span class="font20">at midnight, just a matter of hours from the conclusion of the trial. Justice Surveyer agreed to give judgment the next day, May 25, at </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">2 ;30</span><span class="font20"> p.m,, but in the meantime would suspend the operation of his injunction. The suspension of number two injunction reinstated the first and meant that the assembly could get started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">And so at 9; 00 a.m. on Friday the convention began on schedule, with everyone feeling a little anxious and uneasy about the remainder of the sessions. At 2:30 p.m, that day the judgment of Surveyer J. was given. He was obliged to quash his own injunction given two days previous, much to the chagrin of the city attorney Who had engineered it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A telegram was immediately dispatched to Mr. N. H. Knorr, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">president of the Society,</span><span class="font20"> who was planning to fly from New York to Montreal the following day, Saturday, to advise that there was no further impediment to proceeding with the assembly. Then the Society's representatives drove to the auditorium to make the announcement. The Friday afternoon meetings were in session when the news bearers arrived. Mr. P. Chapman, the Canadian branch servant, announced to the conven-tioners that he had just sent a telegram to Mr. Knorr. He said, “I will read it to you. ‘Jehovah's arm Is not shortened. City of Verdun injunction quashed - convention continuing unimpeded - faith of brothers rewarded - further testimony added to the heap of witness that the Most High God is with us/ &quot;&nbsp;The reading of the wire just got down to the word “quashed&quot; when joy broke loose; everyone cheered so much it was difficult to get the rest of the message read- The auditorium manager's son heard one of the witnesses repeat the text at Isaiah 8:10: &quot;God is with us.&quot; He said: “You know I really think that must be true. The city has stopped things here before, but now they are stopped, It will really be a shock to them. There is something very unusual about you people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">With so much excitement around, the assembly was off to a fine start. Once the legal questions were settled, the City of Verdun officials changed their attitude. The mayor said he had “no comment&quot; on the decision. The city solicitor said he had &quot;no further plans&quot;. The city engineer who had formerly refused a permit to place a sign on the front of the auditorium gave the required permission without question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The director of police proved to be an able and honest police administrator prepared to see law and order enforced. When a number of hoodlums gathered on Friday evening two burly detectives quickly invited them to depart. In the early hours of the morning three carloads of troublemakers drove to the building. Before they could disembark, a police cruiser came alongside And said: “O.K. boys, you're not invited. Climb back in and get on your way!&quot; They did. The Verdun police department is to be commended for competence and a co-operative attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A very fine spirit was shown by many people in Verdun and Montreal in connection with the assembly. People of good will were disgusted with the antics of the Verdun City Council *in trying to stop the convention. Thirty-five hundred persons, including about one thousand strangers, attended on Sunday afternoon and gave rapt attention to the lecture “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land&quot;. They were thrilled to hear Mr. Knorr explain from the Scriptures the prospect of seeing an end of the present evil conditions on the earth and the establishment of true liberty in the new world. Boldly and fearlessly he pointed to the indisputable record that the great persecutors of Jehovah's faithful witnesses world-wide are Roman Catholicism and Russian Communism. “These two organizations follow the same course of action,&quot; he said. “What do they have in common? Neither is interested in the common people. They are both out for world domination.&quot; This uncompromising declaration of the truth was a real encouragement to people of good will who had long been fearful of the strength of the Roman Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The peaceable and highly successful conclusion of the assembly marked a real forward step for Jehovah’s witnesses in Quebec. To see a concerted effort to stop it and to see truth prevail were a source of great encouragement to many timid ones who did not think it could be done. Faithful ministers in Quebec rejoiced to see the standard of Bible education being strongly planted in the land so that many more prisoners could be set free and there could be a continuing proclamation of liberty throughout all the land.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The New York Times In July, 1950, released Public Library Inquiry figures proving that the average American devotes about a quarter of his wakijig hours at the radio, the theater or in readirg. This time usually falls between the evening meal and retirement. The’ survey states that fifty per cent of the American public claimed to have read a book in the previous year. This harmonizes with similar findings by the University of Michigan, which adds that more than half of all adults live within a mile of a public library, while only one-tenth average a visit a month. Television figures, growing increasingly more imposing, were not then available. Of course, radio outlets are always growing too. A Reuters dispatch tells of a fanner in southern Sweden who applied for a radio license at half price. Why? Because he is deaf In one ear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Ernest Kolesiak of South Bend, Indiana, had his time spent in viewing television at least temporarily curtailed last November when his TV antenna fell across a 27,000-volt power line. The results were nothing short of electrifying. Says the Associated Press report: &quot;Balls of fire bounced up and down on &quot;the roof with thunderous explosions. The high voltage burned out the television set and blew off one of the knobs . . . The telephone burned out . . . The house was scorched in three places where wires passed through the walls . . .

His ride wound up a mad gallop through the public streets, threatening aufoists, pedestrians and school children, all of whom fell back before the would-be Paul Revere. When hailed by police who gave chase, Wilder pulled his mount up to a halt. Upon dismounting he crumpled in a heap. He later admitted having been spirited on by &quot;sixteen drinks of gin and as many beer chasers”, generally enough to assure any wild ride. He was held for riding a horse while under the influence of liquor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A woman in Louisville, Kentucky, was halted by a policeman when he considered her driving reckless. The officer later testified to the judge that she had proved &quot;very talkative” when arrested.

But though he may consider feminine correspondence a waste of valuable time, two elevenyear-old American girls took issue with him, charging that &quot;boys talk too much&quot;.

At least you can learn something from the teachers.” Gotz concluded his letter, saying, &quot;Please supply me with a couple of letter friends. I'd even settle for a girl, if it just can’t be helped.” It is well he thus condescended, for the two American girls decided to supply him with firsthand data for further research.

<p><span class="font2">Which Is Practical — the Bible or Modern Civilization?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">ODERN civilization boasts of its progress and culture. It would have</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">us believe that it is wise, practical and scientific, and that the Bible is out of date. Topical of this attitude is the statement made by the head of a Denver, Colorado, (U.S.) theological seminary: &quot;The biggest challenge of religious education is to fit a camel-train philosophy into a diesel civilization.” Not only by words, but also by its entire course of action modem civilization condemns the Bible as a relic of the past, as being most impractical for our day and age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But how practical is this diesel civilization? What is there practical about the two world wars that drenched the earth with human blood and sent millions of the flower of mankind to untimely graved? Can the present fanning of hatred between the East and the West and the preparations for atomic warfare be termed practical? How practical is an economic system which enables a few to roll in luxury while millions eke out a bare existence? Is inflation practical? Is political corruption practical? And what about the soaring divorce rate, the rising tide of crime and dope addiction among both juveniles and adults. Are these practical? Can a civilization that goes at such a pace as to cause an alarming increase in mental and nervous breakdowns be termed practical?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A &quot;practical” civilization ignores such principles of the Bible as &quot;All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them”, and &quot;You must love your neighbor as yourself”. (Matthew 7:12; 22:39, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font20"> Yet if these were followed would there be any &quot;hot” or “cold” wars? economic injustices? political corruption? crime? divorce? racial discrimmation? Of course not! As well expressed by the head of a national law-enforcing agency (U. S.): &quot;I never saw a criminal who believed in the golden rule.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Man cannot solve his problems by pursuing a course of selfishness; he merely makes himself and others miserable. To illustrate: Because of selfishness price controls are needed; these in turn fail to work because selfishness resorts to black markets, and so on and on it goes. On the other hand, by exercising unselfishness, love, we make others happy and ourselves even more so. &quot;There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”—Acts 20:35, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But some will object, saying, “All that is easier said than done!” Of course it is! Everything is easier said than done, but does that mean we should leave everything undone? It is easier to talk about principles than to practice them, true; it is also easier to make taws than to enforce them. Since that is so—Jet us not have any laws? Would anarchy be easier, better, than the enforcement of laws? Of course not! Well, then, why does the diesel civilization try to prove that moral anarchy is easier, better, than moral discipline? If that were so, then God would be proved to be a liar, for he states, “Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,” and again, “They have</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.*’ (Hosea 8:7; Galatians 6:7) But God is not a liar; no one has ever proved him to be a liar and no one ever will, not even all the wise men of our diesel civilization!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Just as a child gradually learns to talk, to keep itself clean, to obey its parents and teachers and to respect the rights of others, so the principles of truth and righteousness can be learned even by adults who have neglected them. It all starts in the mind. It must be made over by filling it with the right kind of knowledge. Christianity is based on that very principle, —Romans 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But, some argue, since the great majority of men would not follow such principles it would be impractical for Christians to do so. In this, however, they are inconsistent. Men agitated against slavery when the majority were still in favor of it Had they not done so we still would have slavery. Men fought and are fighting for political and moral reforms even though they are in the minority. What is wrong and foolish is such regardless of how many are practicing it, and what is wise and right is such even though it may require our standing alone; yet not alone, for Jehovah God is always on the side of right—Romans 3:4; 8:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The principles of the Bible are sound and as far above human reasoning as the heavens are above the earth. (Isaiah 55:8,9) Man wants to give like for like, but the Bible tells us: “A soft answer tum-eth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger,” and “keep conquering the evil with the good”. (Proverbs 15:1; Romans 12:21, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,}</span><span class="font20"> Yes, love begets love, just as hate begets hate, greed begets greed. We are most reluctant to do anything for a lazy fellow or to give to the miserly one. If we fail to trust others they will become suspicious of us, but if we show generosity they will want to be generous: “Practice giving, and people will give to^you. They will pour Into your laps a fine measure, pressed down, shaken together and overflowing. For with the measure that you are measuring out they will measure out to you in return.”—Luke 6:38, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Further, the Bible assures us, “Cast your bread upon the surface of the water, for after many days you will find it.” Also, “The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.” (Ecclesiastes 11:1, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans,;</span><span class="font20"> Proverbs 11:25) Modem civilization pursues happiness but, get what possessions it may, it does not realize its goal. Christians who follow the principles of the Bible seek Jehovah, righteousness and meekness and show unselfishness, and do realize happiness, have godliness with contentment, are “made fat”, “watered” themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">And not only do they themselves appreciate this fact but others also notice it. At the conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses the joy, orderliness, and unselfish cooperation cause much comment. All such is living testimony to the fact that the Bible is practical, that its principles can work, do work, in this very second half of the twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But that is not all. Because Jehovah God is almighty, just, practical and consistent he will not always tolerate the present impractical, unjust and corrupt system of things which dishonors his name, persecutes his servants and spreads so much misery. At Armageddon he will make an end of it and will reward those who have shown love for his practical and righteous principles even to the extent of being willing to suffer persecution for them. Then all people will be united in the righteous principles of His Word.—Luke 18:7,8; 2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 16:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;">Demon Voices That Destroyed a Nation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>K</sup>Awuk*!” to rrwpondent tn South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">T</span><span class="font20">HE history of Africa shows that this continent has had its followers of the cult of necromancy. Most infamous of all was Nongquase, a thirteen-year-old prophetess who, in 1857, caused the destruction of her own native tribe, the Amaxosas. This wealthy tribe, possessing over 200,000 head of cattle, was settled in Kaffraria, an easterly region of the Cape of Good Hope colony. The territory covered an area of 22,000 square miles in which resided less than 1,000 Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Wishing to colonize the territory, the British authorities encouraged immigration, and from 1850 onward increasing numbers of white settlers arrived in Table Bay, These colonists introduced various industries into the country and also built hospitals where the natives were treated free of charge. Confidence in the white man’s medicine grew steadily, particularly when it was found that the European doctors frequently cured cases the tribal doctors could not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The arrival of the white man in ever-increasing numbers to take up the land, and the harm his medicine was doing to the reputation of the tribal doctors, began to cause unrest among the native people, particularly the chiefs and witch doctors. It was at this psychological moment that Nongquase took the stage. Under the control of &quot;voices” Nongquase began to preach an awe-inspiring gospel. The people must kill and eat the best^cattle in the herds. All grain must be destroyed, no land was to be tilled, no planting done, and no crops reaped. Only weapons and implements of war were to remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the place of the destroyed cattle would later rise from the ground herds of cattle finer than any that man had seen. The land would be covered with fine golden com, and from their graves would rise the tribal warriors of old, and these soldiers would lead their people to victory. After the white man had been destroyed a paradise condition would envelop the land; the old would regain their youth, sickness and misery would be no more, and the tribe would increase mightily in power. But, first, every edible thing was to be destroyed as a sacrifice to the gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Messages were sent by Kreli, the tribal chief and father of Nongquase, to the far-flung sections of the tribe, and the mass slaughter of cattle began. The carnage that followed lasted for many weeks. People gorged themselves on the butchered cattle; their dogs became satiated, vultures circled and were filled, but still the slaughtered animals could not be disposed of. The carcasses were left to rot until the air became foul with the stench of decomposing flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">At first only the fattest cattle were killed, but the appetite of the spirits was insatiable and, as the months passed, the destruction increased until the British authorities, becoming alarmed, sent warning notes to the Amaxosas. But this advice, together with the dissenting voices of some of the subchiefs, was ignored and the hysterica] slaughter continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">After nearly ten months of this systematic waste the spirit voices instructed the now-starving people to prepare the kraals for the arrival of the fat new stock. Large skin sacks were made into which would stream the milk that was to flow more abundantly than water. Pits were dug to hold the promised grain and as the emaciated people labored to perform these tasks, Nongquase goaded them on with a final triumphant pronouncement. Only eight days to go before the destruction of their enemies, the opening of the graves, and the joy and feasting that was to be theirs!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">She prophesied that when the moon entered a certain phase which coincided with the date 18th of February, 1857, a blood-red sun would rise in the east. At noon it would reverse and travel back again to set in the east instead of the west. At midday when the sun changed its course the heavens and earth would meet and a terrifying hurricane would sweep away the enemies of the people. Then would come the resurrected warriors, the cattle and the corn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The famished Amaxosas now mustered what little strength they had and spent the last few days reinforcing their stockades and huts to withstand the hurricane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">As the appointed day approached the excitement and hysteria of the survivors of this ten-month religious orgy reached breaking point. Throughout the night preceding the fateful dawn the Rarabe and Tembu tribes kept a nervous vigil out in the open, but the Galeka tribesmen shut themselves in their huts to wait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The sun rose upon that memorable day, normal in color and aspect. And as it journeyed'across the sky in its usual leisurely way without showing any sign of abnormality, it is not difficult to picture the impatience, the apprehension and finally the panic that arose in the breasts of the watchers. Fear reached a crescendo at midday when the promised solar upheaval failed to materialize. But too terrified to abandon hope entirely, they waited until the sun sank in the west before they gave way completely to disillusionment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Then the hunger-crazed people lost all control, and bedlam broke loose. Carnage returned as father turned against brother. Bones of the slaughtered animals were dug up and gnawed hungrily. The skin containers that had been prepared for the promised milk were ripped to pieces and devoured. Those natives with sufficient strength struggled to the farms of the white settlers and to the military frontier posts where they were fed from the stores of food which the colonial administration had collected during the past months for this very purpose. Unable to drag themselves away, many perished where they lay, and for weeks the wild dogs prowled and again the vultures circled overhead. For years the land was strewn with the remains of the dead; skeletons of entire families were found seated under trees or huddled in the crumbling huts, and human bones were found in family cooking pots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Of the original population of nearly 105,000 natives, it is estimated that less than 37,000 survived, and these were scattered; most of them remaining as rough servants on the land of the settlers who fed them. However, Nongquase escaped to British territory and spent the remainder of her days an exile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">As we turn the pages of our history books we feel a great surge of pity for these ignorant dupes of the demons. Surely such things could happen only in the last century and during previous dark ages. Enlightened man of today could not possibly commit racial suicide by destroying his crops, slaughtering his cattle, ravaging the land, and by turning all his energies to the making of weapons of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But that is precisely what twentiethcentury man is doing! Every year great areas of arable land are laid waste by erosion, industrialization, pollution, and soil starvation. Vast regions are set aside for atom bomb tests. The birds of the air, the fish of the sea and the natural fauna of the land are destroyed in the name of “sport” or for commercial gain. Crops by the tons are plowed back under the soil, forests are laid waste, watersheds impaired, the air we breathe is befouled and the earth is drained of mineral content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Guns before butter!** is the cry today, just as in Nongquase's day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; &quot;&nbsp;'Suspended’ is the term which best defines the current state of the world/’ said noted news analyst Anne O’Hare McCormick, as reported in the New York crimes (8/25). That statement is true. A world of suspense today awaits the next danger signal, from Iran, India, Indo-China, Korea, Moscow, East Germany, or some other danger spot. Suspense continued in Korea as the war pressed forward during the truce talk interruption from August 23 until the Red Command announced willingness to resume negotiations September 20. Suspended between war and peace, the U. S. Senate approved (9/13) a $59,508,-009,630 war appropriation bill, the largest single appropriation in U. S. history; and war production now runs at the fantastic rate of $3,000,000,000 a month, according to Charles E. Wilson, head of Defense MobilizatlcHh Fear in Europe leads toward German rearmament and alignment of German troops with British, French and American. <sup>iJ</sup>Simpended&quot; is still the term which best describes the state of the world, and all man’a efforts have been unable to change it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Big 3 and. Atlantic Pact Meet </span><span class="font17">&lt;&amp;&nbsp;France’s Robert Schuman, Britain’s Herbert Morri son and the United States’ Dean Acheson . completed (9/13) three-power talks in Washington, reaching accord on Germans in the European army, agreeing to integrate them into a “European Defense Community&quot; under Elsenhower’s </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">SHAPE command,</span><span class="font17"> but not allowing them a German general staff or separate German army. The occupation will end, but the Allies will retain rights to station defense (not occupation) forces in Germany. A “peace contract&quot; (npt treaty) will also be proposed and signed, if the Bonn government agrees to provide troops for the European army and share the Ruhr’s coal and steel under the Schuman plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A few days later at Ottawa the North Atlantic Council recommended (9/20) that Greece and Turkey be included in the North Atlantic treaty system. Its guarantee of mutual military protection will now probably include the entire Mediterranean sea (but not necessarily its shores, which would include such nations as Egypt, not members of the Atlantic Pact).</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Giving No Real Hope</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; When New York’s Governor Dewey returned from his Pacific tour he proposed (9/18) a complete mutual defense alliance, one treaty to cover all countries from Japan through south Asia to Australia and New Zealand, as a line against Communist aggression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A different suggestion was made by U. S. Supreme Court Justice William Douglas, who said the U. S. is “relying on guns and dollars rather than ideas. . . . Out there you never hear the U. S. voice raised In defense of the little guy. - . . What Asia needs is sympathy, understanding, an attitude of co-operation&quot;. But what ideas should be relied upon? Land reform? That might do much good, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">but</span><span class="font17"> it </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">will not</span><span class="font17"> solve all the problems. East German refugees have said U. S. propaganda gives no real hope for the future. No government today can give such hope, for all have rejected God’s kingdom, the only hope for suffering humanity. Bible students rejoice to know that the real hope and blessings this kingdom will bring to earth are near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">How High Can it Go?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Congress took the matter of inflation quite lightly when it passed the economic controls bill last July. Highly technical amendments were sketchily explained, speakers in the House were limited to 30 seconds’ debate. The rush to pass off such serious matters could not produce satisfactory legislation. Even* further, the new law removed the power to fix slaughtering quotas, stopped roll-backs in beef prices, entitled producers to include in their costs all but “unreasonable and excessive&quot; increases in expenses prior to July </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">26 </span><span class="font17">(which Truman called a “bulldozer, crashing aimlessly through existing price formulas, leaving havoc in its wake&quot;). Truman reluctantly signed the bill (7/31). Since then 1,000,000 automobile workers received slight wage increases </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(8/24), auto prices </span><span class="font17">went up 5 to 6 per cent 0/7), Truman demanded $10,000,000,-000 tax rise (9/20), the House voted pay rises for L500,000 U. S. employees (9/20), and cheered vigorously the suggestion that their own salaries be doubled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Fantastic spending continues to boost Inflation. 'Federal, state and local government expenditures In this fiscal year will equal the entire income of the 22 states west of the Mississippi, plus 5 southern states. Federal expenditures alone equal the income of almost 20 of these, while back In 1929 government spending would have consumed just two-thirds of the income of California.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; &quot;For eighteen months the Government has carried on the affairs of the country with a very small majority In the House of Commons,” said Prime Minister Attlee of Britain (9/19) when he called for a new election October 25. The last election was February 23, 1950, when Labor retained a majority so small that it could be counted almost on the fingers of one hand. Attlee's statement said the government should receive “adequate Parliamentary support” for the &quot;Important issues with which the country is faced”. The Conservatives hope current issues will help tip the balance of power to their side. The main issue, however, will be whether the British want more Socialism or a return to more free enterprise. The elections will give them the opportunity to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">State Aid to Catholic Schools</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Shall tax money, taken from all the people, be paid out to a religious organization for support of its schools? The pope said it should (9/14). Non-Cathollcs frequently disagree violently, recognizing the right of others to reject public schools, but not wanting to pay for religious teaching that is against their own belief, whether In a school or church. This has been a violent issue in many lands. In France state aid to parochial schools has monopolized attention since the new National Assembly convened in July, and has even blocked Cabinet activity In other fields. Finally the national assembly agreed (9/10) to break through former laws on secular education and grant direct state aid to private and Roman Catholic schools. A similar issue<sup>1</sup> came up in Wisconsin (9/12), when a father was called Into court for refusing to send his two sons to a public school where several nuns were teaching, “because I don't like the parochial nature of the school.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Employment, World-wide</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; The International Labor Office in Geneva, Switzerland, reported (9/17) that unemployment dropped sharply in most countries during the summer. Israel and Norway were the only lands reporting large Increases in unemployment this year. The reduction of unemployment will prtfbably continue, because the 18 nations forming the European Marshall Plan Council have planned to Increase their industrial production by 25 per cent within five years, and U. S. defense mobilizer Wilson predicted (9/16) that wage scales and productive economy would never go back to preKorean levels. Although present conditions contribute toward full employment, the somber side of the picture is that fear of war and production of weapons is what has added to employment worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Propagandist Blips</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Soviet press pictures the U. S. economic system as being In a bad way, with fantastic unemployment and beggars groveling in the streets. Yet A. A. Soldatov, Soviet representative at the U. N., has apparently overlooked reading the papers from home, because he proposed (9/12) that the U.S. pay 50 per cent of the U.N.'s operating cost, since it Is best equipped to do so. To the Soviet bloc's 10 per cent, the U. S. now pays 38.92 per cent. Soldatov’s argument does not speak well for his government's claims, but it does show the inconsistencies of political propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Water for Mexico City</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">$ Mexico City celebrated the end of its immemorial water shortage in September. It could well rejoice over this. The new distribution system was opened by President Miguel Afemfin, who spun a wheel that brought Lerma River water through 40 miles of ditches and tunnels into the city, where, for the first time in modern history, there was a 24-hour water supply. But under the strain of both the new water supply and heavy rains the city's ancient drainage system broke down, and before a week was out the abundant supply of water had to be reduced. Overhauling the drainage system will probably cost more than twice the amount spent for the water project</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Wrinkle</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Search had been under way nearly two months in a 1,000-square-mile area of the English Channel for the British submarine “Affray”, which sank in April with 75 men and officers aboard. This was no old-fashioned search, with deep-sea divers doing the work. It was carried on with sonic gear that located 90 different wrecks, after which a television camera (mounted with special searchlights In a watertight container) would be lowered to peer at the wrecks on the Channel’s rocky bottom. On the 59th day the camera, 285 feet down, picked up the image of a submarine. The watchers above saw the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">conning tower, the side of the boat, then the name, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Affray,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">New TV Color Tube</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Promise of lower-cost color television was made by a new television tube designed by Prof. Ernest O. Lawrence of the University of California. It was privately shown (9/19) to engineers in New York, where it was reported that the tube is simple to manufacture, and can be mass-produced at a cost only slightly higher than present black-and-white tubes. It is supposed to be adaptable for black-and-white programs, as well as forC.B.S. (mechanical) andR.C.A. (electronic) color broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">700-MPH Robot Bomb</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">$ Self-propelled guided missiles are directed to their targets by remote control. They are similar to the perman V-bombs used In World War II, except that V-Kxnbs had no guiding mechanism. U. S. experiments wltn true robot bomba have progressed to the point that a new Air Force unit has been formed to operate the B-61 Matador, a 30-foot-iong, radar-g u I d e d, jet-propelled, stubby-winged missile, which is believed to fly about 700 miles an hour, It may carry the new reduced-size, atomic bomb at speeds fighter planes cannot intercept.

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Armageddon Coming</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; In discussing the changing conditions since </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">1914, when </span><span class="font17">Britain was the greatest empire in history and France the leading state In Europe, the New York Mirror (9/11) said, &quot;The great changes which 37 years of war, revolution and economic distress have brought about have not yet influenced traditional attitudes. But the world is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font17"> close to Armageddon that there Is no time for sentimentalities?<sup>1</sup> The Mirror could more accurately have said, The world Is so close to Armageddon that there is no time for anything except gaining God’s favor to survive it/ but the ' Mirror was talking about political changes, and apparently it has made the common mistake of considering any violent, decisive war as “Armageddon”. Actually, conditions since 1914, Combined with accurate Bible chronology, prove that Armageddon, the “great day of God the Almighty^ </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in which all</span><span class="font17"> wickedness will be destroyed by Jehovah's power, will come in our day, after which God's kingdom will bring peaceful blessings forever to earth. It is sure; it is of vitally more importance than the world's traditional rivalries, and it is worth working for!</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
