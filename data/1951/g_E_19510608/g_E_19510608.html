V., June 8, 1951 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 11</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark19"></a>SECURITY</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">F</span><span class="font0">EAR can rip open the strongest defenses. Like a deadly dagger that slips through the walls ot flesh and passes into the internal organs of a man, so can fear cut straight to the vitals of a nation of men. Also, the same thing that makes one man fearful is responsible when a nation is so afflicted. This common denominator is insecurity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the ancient peoples dwelt in tribes, then in small kingdoms, their quest for security made them gather together, at first by families, then by cities and so on. The Bible, most ancient of our reliable histories, unveils the initial act outside Eden responsible for fear and insecurity in Cain’s murder of his brother Abel. In the same murderous, aggressive spirit of Cain, violent rulers of the world since have piled new fagots on the coals he ignited. When compared to the civilization we know, man of antiquity would be considered by the modems as not possessed of much. But if he had little to protect aside from home and personal possessions, he had as well very little to protect against, to compare with this same modem civilization. In the sense of material values, today’s world can probably be said to have 'everything'—everything, that is, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">except </span><span class="font0">security. If men have come to where words fail to describe their progress, they have also come to where their ‘hearts are failing them for fear’. Alas, for all of its rocket missiles, international leagues, knowledge of atomic energy, radar and television, this age has failed to remedy that. This world is scared stiff!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A look in any direction proves the truthfulness of the foregoing. Passing time does little more than show the weakness of each remedy. Five years ago some persons thought that a compelling reason for uniting in peace had been discovered in the atomic bomb. Now, however, this is clearly belied by the facts. More than ten years ago, security was sought by appeasing the conquest-minded forces of totalitarian aggressors. But on December 15,1950, the president of the United States said, “The world learned from Munich that security cannot be bought by appeasement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This time a different pattern is proposed. Said Mr. Truman, on the occasion just cited: “We will build up our own army, navy and air force and make more weapons for ourselves and our allies.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fearing, though, that in this vacillating world even professed allies cannot be trusted, former president Herbert Hoover recently called for cessation of U.S. men and money for Europe and concentration of American power in defending the Western Hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Preparing for possible attack against the United States, cities of this land are swinging back to civilian defense programs utilized during the last war. Educational measures detailing proper action during an air attack are being circulated, including information on defense against biological and chemical warfare. A twenty-one-minute motion picture in color describes what to do if your city is hit by an atomic bomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Security measures of another type have cropped up in legislation, such as the “Internal Security Act”. But this legislative crackdown on communists is so severe that its opponents accuse it of undermining the very free institutions it claims to protect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Loyalty oaths have been either adopted or proposed by many leading industries and professions, such as teachers and lawyers. However, the pressure often accompanying the signing of such oaths all but destroys any significance they might have. Loyalty oaths only loom as another search for elusive security, a search now at desperation proportions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other side of the globe trepidation is just as evident Mounting tension since the war’s close in 1945 has been paced by ever deeper secrecy on the part of Russia and her satellites. Bristling with strength, Russia’s never demobilized armed forces and those of her deputy states have stood poised around the vast frontiers of communism like ominous sentinels. In pretended defense of the security of these borders, this vast octopuslike war machine has lashed out with its tentacles to produce sample wars, as in Indo-China and Korea. Veiled threats currently belch forth from the'parent Soviet that efforts of the West to rearm Western Germany may provoke further defense of communist “security”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Over the entire seething structure of division and trustless hate the United Nations sits brooding. Its official forces are dispatched to fight aggression while some of its members support the aggressors. The U. N. is but an international clinic where all the world’s cases of shattered nerves are collected together in one spot. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fear</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Doubt</span><span class="font0"> hold permanent seats in the security council and general assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some form the search for security is evident in every branch of human society: price and wage controls to meet the economic crisis, religious councils and leagues for moral unity, youth movements to fight delinquency. Individuals, too, have their suggestions. One man offered a cave in which to hide leading scientists, professional men and young people capable of starting anew the race following a global holocaust of World War in, in which he felt all civilization would be wiped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To look upon this fear-struck world moves one with a desire to offer it a true hope. But what? When'Jesus the Master Prophet foretold these fearful days he added, for benefit of his believing followers: “But as these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.” (Luke 21:28,</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.) </span><span class="font0">Their deliverance is near because Christ’s kingdom is near, “even at the doors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That makes this a time of choice, with eternal destiny in the balance. Those leaning toward human schemes do well to hear what Paul the inspired apostle said concerning their chances of success: “Whenever it is that they are saying, ‘Peace and security!’ then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape.”—1 Thessalonians 5:3, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For all of its apparent efforts toward security, this world is not even a pale substitute for God’s kingdom by Christ. Remember, the Kingdom can furnish deliverance, peace and everlasting life. How much better is this than an international collection of nervous breakdowns or a cave! It is well worthy of your choice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">SCIENCE CULTIVATES THE OYSTER'S GIFT</span></p><img src="g_E_19510608_files/g_E_19510608-2.png" alt="" style="width:643pt;height:203pt;">
<p><span class="font0">considerably. If the baby oyster can get a start on a hardsurfaced bottom in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">i/AUT </span><span class="font0">you go!’ says </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">V/ </span><span class="font0">in effect the oyster's proud parent. Simultaneously, the elder oyster opens the valves of its shell and propels its offspring larva into outside waters. Thus the baby oyster gets its start, brutal in any language. The brood begins life with two and a half strikes on it. Hungry marine life may devour the larva at once or it may be washed away to localities unfavorable to oyster development or become buried in soft mud or become the victim of a sudden change in weather for the colder, all of which things spell doom to the oyster larva or “spat”. So many are its perils and so meager its defenses, it appears certain that were it not for its very prolific nature the oyster would long before now have been known to civilization only through encyclopedias. It is believed that American female oysters produce literally millions of eggs. Some oysters are Ttemwi-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">phroditic^</span><span class="font0"> possessed of both male and female sex organs in one animal, though with most species the sexes are distinct. Some are known to undergo a change of sex during life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though present admirers admit that the first to try the succulent oyster must have been a man of brave digestive traits, the fact remains that this shell-bom delight was known and loved by the ancients. Britain’s sea-food capital, Colchester, was the site df the first Roman colony in the land A.D. 50, and the rich oyster beds nearby are thought to have influenced the Romans shallow water, it is on its way. By the first year the average oyster will have grown from one-twentieth of an inch at birth to an inch in diameter. Thereafter they grow at the rate of about an inch a year, and are considered in their prime around the five-year mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The oyster's life, however, remains harrowing, Number one on its “hate parade” is the starfish. Schools of these clamp themselves on clusters of oysters and apply suction to draw the shells apart. At length, the adductor muscle within that holds the shells closed becomes fatigued, gives up, thus opening the door and at once the starfish peculiarly turns its own stomach inside out and slips it within the shell to devour its defenseless prey. But the underdog has been known to “come off the ropes” and score an upset by clamping its shells shut again upon unsuspecting animals out hunting at low tide. Rats have been known caught in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The interior these predatory foes as well as gourmet man so earnestly seek is truly remarkable among living organisms. One cannot make head or tail of it, or foot either, <sub>(</sub> for it has none of these. In the middle, though, are the intricate heart, reproductive organs, liver, stomach and adductor muscle. Lips, mouth and gills are found as well as a covering of skin around the inside of the shell. For nourishment the oyster lets in a fresh supply of water. Anything digested must first be sifted through the gills, then pass the approval of the lips which, if it is desirable, will relay it into the mouth. The oyster is a fastidious eater, confining its diet mainly to microscopic plants and animals.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Cultivating a Tastier Morsel</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Through oyster culture much has been made up to the oyster in a highly scientific way for its otherwise very hard life when left alone in open waters. The early Romans inaugurated oyster culture, at least as far as England was concerned,' when they transplanted English oysters to their own shores, Today there are oyster farms in England where oysters are cared for in water of the right moderate temperature and shallow depth with the proper hard bottom. Extreme care is exercised to protect the oyster from the larva stage onward, that it may have every aid in waxing fat and succulent</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The United States too has given all-out attention to oyster farming in an effort to halt the staggering drop in production that sent the crop reeling down to 90,000,-000 pounds a year by 1945, about half its size of sixty years ago. Oysters are cared for even before they exist. Where it is determined a cluster of oysters will discharge their &quot;spat”, hard shells are distributed on the bottom. After they have settled and grown on the shells for two years, they are raised and knocked free that the crowded quarters (of twenty-five or thirty on one shell) may be relieved and better growth assured, Then they are transplanted into new beds selected as favorable for their next period of growth. After the three-year level they are again transferred, this time to beds specifically designed for fattening. At five years as a minimum they are raised for sorting and marketing. That is, the finest, largest, most juicy ones are packed for shipment Those not measuring up to specifications are sorted out for return to the beds and further fattening. Government protection guards against poachers, and the beds are defended as well against the natural enemies of the oyster. Even when on board the dredging boats the oysters are kept on deck to prevent pollution from the engine fumes below. Of course, all this scientific cultivation primarily benefits man, the donor. Yet no honest oyster can deny that those so cultivated gain a far greater life-expectancy as a result thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the height of science’s cultivation of the oyster’s natural gifts reaches far beyond the palate. Everyone knows the product for which some oysters are world famed. Everyone knows—the women who primarily wear the breath-taking pearls, as well as their husbands, suitors, fathers or brothers who buy them.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The <sup>1</sup> Million-Dollar Look?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though the expression “You look like a million” might be a trifle inflated, an attractive young lady could very easily look like $300,000. This goal can be achieved by wearing the following pearl jewelry as displayed in the New York </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mirror</span><span class="font0"> of May 21, 1950: a pair of earrings ($10,000), shoulder straps (three on each shoulder, $50,000), a brooch ($5,000), bracelets (three on each arm, $65,000), pearl rings (two large pearls, $10,000), a handbag (of 12,000 cultured pearls plus twelve carats of carved rubies and ten carats of round and baguette diamonds, $40,000) and six individual necklaces in graduating lengths, $120,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Actually, just as oysters have been enjoyed since ancient times, so have pearls. The ancients obtained thejr pearls mainly from India and the Persian Gulf. However, fruitful pearl fields have been found as *well in the Sulu seas, off the coast of Australia, off Central America’s coastline and among some of the South Pacific islands. For long, divers have used similar methods, A cord with a sinker of stone weighing some forty pounds is used to lower the diver, if he wishes. They work in pairs, one watching the line with which he raises first the sinker, then the baskets of oysters, while the other dives for the prize. Divers can remain under for an average of from fifty to eighty seconds, although some exceptional individuals have been able to remain for longer periods. Since sharks are quite at home in most pearl oyster haunts, the native Indian diver will never go down without first obtaining the incantations of shark charmers sent along for the purpose. However, due either to contact with too many “uncharmed” sharks or to this steady exertion in ‘the tropical climate, most divers are never bothered with old age.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Science of “Home-made” Pearls</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ordinarily, pearls are formed when a tiny parasite becomes wedged between the shell and the mantle, the layer of skin just inside the shell. Some have thought that a grain of sand could cause this as well, though this no longer enjoys widespread acceptance. As the parasite remains in its position within the shell it becomes a permanent irritant, gathering about it increasing amounts of the “mother-of-pearr substance lining the shell. Time and nature trade the worthless parasite for a rare gem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With cultured pearls the irritating agent is placed in the oyster by hand, following which event the creature is returned to its ocean bed to sleep for from three to eight years. During this time layers of pearl will form around the irritant. The size of the pearl will depend on the length of time allowed for development. The cheaper grades of cultured pearls come from oysters that have been injected with larger irritants and permitted to remain in the ocean for a shorter period of time. The Imperial Pearl Syndicate, world's largest importers of cultured pearls, developed an irritant of true mother-of-pearl, thus producing a “pearlier” pearl. Of course, for all the culturing, the pearl-producing Asiatic oyster still has to do the job in its native waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At f\rst oysters were artificially furnished with irritants by having the shell forced open. This resulted in a high oyster death toll and a proportionate defeat for the purpose of culturing pearls. Thanks to science again, however, this method has been scrapped in favor of a way far easier on the oyster. Now a suitable anesthetic has been devised which effectively knocks out the oyster long enough to permit the injection of the Irritant. And so again the oyster benefits from a step dictated by its value to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pearl proves a glowing fruitage, well repaying man’s care for its producer. For instance, there is the famed “Star of the South Seas” necklace, consisting of seventy-nine cream rosea pearls. David Goldstone, joint head of the Imperial Pearl Syndicate, informed the New York </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mirror </span><span class="font0">that this masterpiece from the ocean floor of the Dutch East Indies required eight years to assemble. From oyster shell to its new abode on the fair sex of mankind, the pearl's story is novel and sparkling. Lending its own beauty to that of woman, it is indeed enough to provoke the “other half” to brand it a ‘million-dollar look<sup>1</sup>, even though the gem’s value may not be quite that great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus, the humble oyster, cast out of its home as a mere “infant” and subject to a continuous chain of perils through life, finds itself persistently cared for by man and science to whom it represents the height of delicacies in food and a ’glittering treasure in jewels.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Most readers from their school days will fondly recall the humorous daring of the Spanish self-made knight in makeshift armor whose horse, through leanness, “had more quarters than pence in a sixpence.” Besides achieving fame for the author, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Don Quixote’s</span><span class="font0"> wild jousts in the cause of chivalry satirically broke the back of the Spanish knighthood craze. Best known of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quixote’s</span><span class="font0"> exploits is his one-man charge upon a row of windmills that he fancied were an army of invading giants with great swinging arms. The first of the imaginary foes put him to rout when its wind-driven sail caught and shattered the knight’s lance, then lifted horse and rider thereby into the air. A badly shaken Sir Don Quixote landed in a heap some distance away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And who today is the modem </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Don Quixote</span><span class="font0"> of Spain? Who but the Fascist dictator that in 1939 imagined himself the glorious victor over “communism” at the death of the Spanish Republic? But American correspondents, including George Sel-des and Alexander H. Uhl, besides a host of other sources, have long since punctured that fable. They did not, however, end Franco's use of the “Red scare”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">El Caudillo’s</span><span class="font0"> Bourbonish “castle in Spain” and the pomp and inordinate tastes that inevitably go with dictators have been maintained at the expense of a wretched people whose condition has steadily worsened. To periodic outbursts of discontent the Franco regime has been alert to always attach the Red label. Only this March, a unified action by the workers of Barcelona brought virtually all city activity to a standstill, in a strike protesting the terrific rise in living costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At once, the “windmill warrior” screamed “communism” according to script, and sharpened his lance to go trotting out to give battle. Singlehandedly the gallant </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Don</span><span class="font0"> of the twentieth century faced the hordes of Barcelona “giants”, the workers, dangerously armed with malnutrition and poverty, from his well-guarded Madrid stronghold some 300 miles away. Bravely he poured troops and armed police into Barcelona to quell the violence which did not begin in earnest until the police moved on the protesting public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font0"> March 24, 1951, J. Alvarez del Vayo said concerning this action by Franco’s government; “The Cabinet met hastily in the night and in its bewilderment decided to send four warships to Barcelona, apparently not considering what an impression of weakness this might create abroad. Afterward it lost what little respect it still enjoyed at home by explaining that the ships had gone to Barcelona on a ‘visit’. Hungry and sad as they are, the Spanish people have not lost their sense of humor, and they are exchanging jokes about the 'tourist fleet’. But the damage had been done abroad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With rare courage, the generalissimo issued his fearless decree that all participating strikers should be deprived of their wages .for the time lost Then later, in a display of mercy probably unsurpassed in modern history, he relented and decided they should have a chance to make up for these lost wages by working overtime. Ah, is it any wonder that the Spanish people are so in love with their kind </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quixote®</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Do not think that this Barcelona incident is weak or isolated or of no political significance in or outside of Spain. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font0"> article Vayo made haste to point out that the press’ figures counted 300,000 workers involved.. The writer states that private sources from inside Spain put the total at half a million. Further, Mr. del Vayo states that when Franco falls the Barcelona date, March 12, 1951, will be recorded as the beginning of the end. He recalls that under Franco law, the slightest word, written or oral, that can be construed in a subversive way is enough to land the originator in jail. Yet here the largest city in Spain lay buried under a flood of pamphlets and posters voicing the people's protest. The public had found its voice and was calling the bully's bluff. Adding insult to injury, American news agencies stated that the strike was no more than over when other leaflets were systematically being distributed calling for another walkout on April 1, a celebrated date, Franco’s “Victory Day”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>“Giant Killer” Brought Low</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The communist scare seems at last to be wearing thin in Spain, though probably few Spaniards have ever taken it seriously. Correspondents report that popular feeling considers official “communism” charges in the Barcelona incident pure nonsense. C. L. Sulzberger, in a recent series of articles appearing in the New York </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font0">points out that, as ever, substantial and organized underground opposition to Franco operates entirely independent of communism. Ironically though, whereas the communists constituted no threat when Franco launched his revolution in 1936, they have grown in strength under his regime. Correspondent Sulzberger states that some sources contend there are now 250,000 communists in Spain, but adds that the government keeps this information suppressed from foreign embassies. With reference to conditions in general Mr. Sulzberger states, despite Franco’s ability thus far to remain a jump or two ahead of his adversaries:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Nevertheless, one thing he has not been able to do is to endear himself to the people. Opposition representatives hold that only the functionaries of the government and large elements of the army and church support him; that the huge mass of the Spanish people remains surly and opposed, if for the present unvocal”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perhaps more and more of them are perceiving in Franco no “giant killer” instinct as advertised. They know the 1936 government he murdered for and with the help of Hitler and the Nazis was democratic, not communistic. They know the Barcelona strike was their own protest against inhuman living conditions. And thus they know Franco's “giants” are only windmills. Instead of a glorious victor over communism, perhaps they see him in the same pose in which the legendary </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quixote </span><span class="font0">found himself, piled up in a jumbled heap of rusty armor clutching the shattered stump of a broken lance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How important it is to review the true pose of Franco today, now that he represents fascism’s last stand in Europe; now that he is the last reminder of the scourge that took the horrible toll in life and wealth during six long years of World War II. So important, yes, because this same Franco, without a shade of change, has within the past few months been recognized anew by the U.N.'s making possible diplomatic ’exchange with the independent member governments, and provided with a $62,500,000 American loan.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Protestants in Spain</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How does Franco stand on the freedoms so vital to the West? His iron curtain of censorship, taboos on free speech and police-state rule are as notorious as Stalin’s. Despite pretensions of Catholic propaganda in the democracies, Protestants have suffered in the extreme under Franco rule. W. E. Garrison has the following to say in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century</span><span class="font0"> of October 18, 1950: “It is notable that Spanish Catholic papers, being published for home consumption, say nothing of this kind [that Spain provides freedom of worship]. The term has no propaganda value in Spain. When they mention the Protestants at all, it is to say what a godless, immoral, revolutionary and un-Spanish gang they are, to exhort the faithful to see to it that these heretics are kept in their proper subordinate and inconspicuous place, and to stress the restrictions which the fundamental law of the country puts upon them rather than the small liberties which it guarantees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The deep significance behind this Ione point lies in the fact that the world’s most powerful Protestant country, the United States, has concluded a $62,500,000 loan’to Franco Spain. What a high price to pay an assassin to help you commit suicide! Furthermore, talk now persists that America is dickering with Franco over possible Spanish entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Certainly all sense of moral values and common principles must be swallowed to tolerate a course like this for a nation like the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The moral question has deep roots. Already such whispering has shaken the confidence of the North Atlantic partners. Britain and France have cautioned the United States on hasty fraternization with Spain, stressing Franco's grave European unpopularity, even in strongly Catholic France, Also, it is well to note that Spain is today a land whose industry is dead and its poverty deplorable. Sanitation is unknown. Disease runs rampant and young children run naked. Her vaunted standing army is in no way. equipped for an all-out war with communism. Already the Franco government is reported to have asked U.S. materiel as a prerequisite to Spain’s contribution of man power in a Western European army. Spanish highways and railroads are far below even the minimum required to make the country a Western defense fortress. Total costs to rebuild Spain in such a way as to solve these basic needs would place a continuous drain on the West for an incalculable period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Furthermore, the evidence mounts daily to show what a poor investment this would be. Referring again to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation’s</span><span class="font0"> article on the Barcelona flare-up, we note that writer Vayo said: “The Barcelona strike has destroyed the myth of ‘external order’ from which a regime like Franco’s draws its strength. It has shaken the government’s confidence that nothing would ever happen in Spain and that to stay in power it only had to increase each year the amount allotted to the police in the budget—and hope for more money from Washington.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Final embarrassment rises from the view expressed in a publication called “The Churchman” for January 1,1951, that even the pessimistic ones among Franco’s opposers in Spain were estimating that eighty per cent of the populace was against him, U.S. aid and diplomatic overtures have suddenly caused the Franco press to go wild in hailing American support to the regime. What a cup of cool water such aid must be now to a tottering government whose people are at last finding courage to defy its tyranny. Has America come to the aid of*a Franco facing ruin at home just in time to save him from his own people?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Company She Keeps</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But if her allies and the liberty-loving Spanish “underground” have been shocked by the company she keeps, America can reap solace from the flexible mouth of Spain’s new ambassador to the United States, Don Jose de Lequerica y Erquiza. This one-time pro-Nazi, who intermediated France’s 1940 surrender and later served as Franco’s ambassador to the puppet-Nazi regime of Vichy, recently presented his credentials in Washington. President Truman, who openly opposed Congress* favorable action on Spain, cut the whole affair, including handshakes, to three minutes. But Don Jose managed to get in a nice diplomatic mouth ful-of-noth in g first, saying: “The present efforts of your country, perhaps unparalleled in the history of man, have made it the nation towards which all countries desiring </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">international morality </span><span class="font0">turn.” But such a statement from a representative of Franco’s government does not mean much. It means even less in light of the fact that to reopen relations with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Franco, the U.S. had to backtrack on its past concepts of “international morality”. With a representative from a man as Internationally lmmdtal as Franco in her house, while her own ambassador now lives under Franco’s roof, it is difficult to understand how America can hope to long preserve her international reputation, if any remnants of it actually remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Desertion of principle to embrace Franco is only another example of the infidelity of man-rule under demon influence in this old world. There is the very real possibility that American democracy is now courting a government that the majority of the Spanish people do not want. More than one authority now claims that his populace would be unwilling to fight a European war under Franco. Remember too, Franco is no comrade-to-the-death. It is obvious that he has considerably greater love for fascism than for democracy. Yet, never did he declare open war on the side of Germany and Italy during World War n, simply because they never came close enough to victory to satisfy him. How long would he wait in a World War in before joining his now-avowed friends in the West?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do you think he would not chance waiting to be left with a communist Europe about him ? He held back to let his enemies surround him Jiefore. Already he has given assurance that Spain would deal with the Reds if Western aid were not forthcoming. This international poker player is a political chameleon whose colors change with every wind. One more switch would never stumble him,</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>&quot;Quixote's” </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Last Ride Near</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So we ask, Why does democracy support a fickle, totalitarian tyrant? Why does the strongest Protestant power on earth shower so rich a gift on the world's outstanding persecutor of Protestants? Why does the democratic West come to the aid of Europe’s fascist oasis just in time to prevent its desolation? Why do champions of liberty offer the strong right hand of fellowship to the black-hearted murderer of freedom who once wrote love letters to Hitler and Mussolini, who offered to jump in on their spoils, who once said he longed for the day when German bombers would blast the skyscrapers of New York? Why? For the temporary and questionable end of military expediency. They woo a potential ally, the dead weight of whose poverty-ridden, industry-stilled nation may cripple their progress elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In such manner they laud and embrace a supposed gallant victor over “communism” on the battlefield. A “communism” this, that championed the separation of church and state, that refused to permit feudalism and serfdom in the twentieth century, that treated all religions alike and allowed each an equal right of practice, that tried to bring its country out of the Dark Ages and up with the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Franco is a fraud! He fought against things communism has never advocated-He opposes the very principles America swears to uphold by its Constitution. He is no gallant knight; he is a cheap fraud in rusty armor; and his imaginary foes are only “windmills”, if one of these does not catch him with its sail and topple him from his swayback, totalitarian nag, he will fall at the very latest beneath the fist of almighty power delivered by Jehovah God through his unconquerable warrior, Christ Jesus, at Armageddon. It will be of no advantage then to have aided a fascist slaughterer of innocent lives. Men may gag on their own principles and spit them out in a crisis, but Jehovah God remembers every syllable of his Word of truth. Never will his conquering warrior retreat from the principles championed by God’s kingdom government. Rather, he wifi fulfill these and promote the worship of the true God in all the earth. He will remember, too, his sworn program of righteousness, destroying all wickedness and bringing to his subjects everlasting life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">Piot on </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Pope and Vatican?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">The People <sub>f</sub></span><span class="font21"> a paper from London, England, of January 28, 1951, headed one of its columns: &quot;Red Plot to Seize Pope and Vatican.&quot; The article, compiled by the paper's diplomatic correspondent, related a report emanating out of Russia by an East German diplomat to the effect that Palmjro Togliatti, head of the Italian Communist party, had laid before Cominform leaders a plan to liquidate the pope and the College of Cardinals. While the Cominform's attitude toward the alleged plan, which would require exertion of pressure in Italy designed to produce a revolution within the next eighteen months, was unknown, the correspondent pointed out that &quot;Russia has so far regarded Germany as 'top priority’ The item continued, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;I learned that Togliatti told the conference: &quot;The conquest of Western Germany may give communism industrial control of Europe, but we cannot win ideological control, we cannot establish the revolution firmly, until we have smashed the Church. Therefore, we must put the Italian revolution first and end the power of the pope and the cardinals. Togliatti added that a successful revolution in Italy—where there are 2,000,000 Communists, more than in any other nonCommunist country- would draw off Allied forces from Germany, Austria and Trieste. That would leave the way clear for German Reds to take over Berlin and then march on West Germany to establish ‘Home Rule’.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By *'Awake!&quot; correspondent In Gold Coast</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">C. P. P.; those are the call letters ringing through the Gold Coast, wealthiest British West African colony. Small children hardly able to speak can yet repeat, “Cee Pee Pee?&quot; The three consonants are printed with durable plantain on inland roads and busy intersections of main towns. They are plastered on buildings, billboards, posts; hung from the rear of cycles, taxis arid transport trucks; scrawled on blackboards by school children; blared out in code from the horns of vehicles of every description and put to song by joyful crowds dancing through the streets almost continually day and night. Why all this extreme excitement? For what reason could almost everyone seem so happy? What is this C. P. P.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is the eve (February 7, 1951) of the first election in this country. Tomorrow the people go to the polls for the first time in their history to elect 38 African members to a new Legislative Assembly which brings with it the greatest measure of self-government given to any West African colony in the Commonwealth. The existing Territorial Councils will elect another 37, and at most there will be nine Europeans in the house of 84 seats. Africans are to be given eight out of eleven cabinet posts and will control everything except defense, external affairs, the civil service, finance and justice.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Loudest Voice</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Loudest of voices in this struggle has been the Convention People’s Party (C. P. P.), and with little opposition they are as determined to take the majority of seats as they were in obtaining S. G. (self-government) when launching their Party, June 12,1949, on a policy of “self-government now through positive action”. Seven months after the lusty pursuit of their party program, strikes and agitation brought emergency measures by the government which lasted three months, teaming the party leader, Kwame Nkrumah, with six other party members, in prison charged with inciting others to take part in an illegal strike and printing seditious articles in his newspaper, the Accra </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News,</span><span class="font0"> Far from being dampened in spirit, the party leaders mounted boxes and gathered groups in the villages to zealously foment hatred for imperialistic practices and to further their political aims at- “freedom”. In the Legislative Council the government was considering possibilities of an early election in conformity with the provision laid down in a new constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“The eyes of the whole empire will be on the way in which this election is conducted,” quoted Governor Arden Clark in his address to the last meeting of the Legislative Council and referring to the words spoken of the Gold Coast in a recent debate in the House of Commons. By strenuous efforts a large staff, with 16 trucks carrying charts and recordings in five languages, had been touring the country explaining registration to people speaking about 25 languages and dialects and who were asked to vote before they could read or write. Preparation has been extensive for this challenging date, February 8, 1951. About 70,000,000 Africans are watching the developments of this experiment, for if S. G. succeeds here, other African colonies will cry, &quot;What about us?’* On its result rest untold millions of European capital investment. &quot;This is not an election/* stated the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Graphic,</span><span class="font0"> a British newspaper in the colony, &quot;it’s a crusade.” The African contends: &quot;The challenge is with us—inexorable as death.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>E-Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cheers! E-Day! Newspapers are filled with political news this morning: who to vote for, where to cast your vote, how the results will be declared from the Town Hall and broadcast over Z. O. the Accra broadcasting station. Red, green and white cars sporting flags of the same colors announce C. P. P., to sweep the polls. &quot;There is victory for us in the struggle of the C. P, P.; there is victory for us, Oh yes! There is victory for us,” sing the many groups dancing through the streets of the capital city. Blasts from horns and whistles of railway engines signal out the &quot;Morse code” of C. P. P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the evening upward of 8,000 people assembled at the Town Hall, and, though quite orderly, their exuberant joy broke into singing and dancing as results were announced from the balcony. The police band and native drums supplied entertainment. Finally, the long awaited climax in returns came through. Like a shot from a cannon came the announcement: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kwame Nkrumah is elected!</span><span class="font0"> Still in James Fort prison on the charge of sedition against the government, the zealot for independence had won a seat in the new government. His party, with a motto; “We prefer self-government with danger to servitude in tranquillity,” walked away with 34 seats, while the United Gold Coast Convention party took three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hilarious with excitement the crowd rushed out through the town leaving the grounds of Town Hall dark and vacant in but a few minutes. beer bars opened wide their doors; petty trading stores were in some cases forced to open for business; car groups pulled up to a darkened building soon to set it aglow with excitement &quot;Mad with Nkrumah victory they sang and danced in streets night long,” wrote a staff writer of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spectator Daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nor did the festivities quiet down much in the capital city next day, but there was a new trend of thought to the discussions. Groups gathered on street corners around bill postings of the daily news headlines. Rumors, whisperings and gossip spread like wildfire. ‘Kwame Nkrumah will be coming out today,’ 'Surely, the government will not hold the seven party members in prison now.’ Unrest and tension seemed to run through the populace and the daily newspapers whipped up the enthusiasm. Gbedemah, now acting chairman of the C. P. P., was in jail not so long ago for political offenses and now he might find himself minister of education, which would also give him control of prisons. This gave a new twist to discussions. Confident of realizing their expectations and trusting in lusty insistency of its demands, the political camp continued in song: &quot;Kwame Nkrumah’s body is behind prison bars, but his soul goes marching on. Fight the good fight with all thy might, Kwame Nkrumah is on thy right.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Radio Bomb</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Vague rumors and speculations about Nkrumah’s release proved to be false until a few days later, when, like an atomic bomb explosion to the Gold Coast, the British broadcasting station announced during its afternoon news feature that the governor had released Kwame Nkrumah from prison. People were practically blown out into the streets by the flash, and in Accra, less than half an hour after the premature release of the news, there was a convergence at James Fort prison. “Freedom! Freedom was the shout coming from the gathering, numbering well over 9,000. Traffic was jammed as people ran from every direction. Women, faces daubed with white powder and dressed in large white cloths, symbol of victory, danced wild with joy, singing, “Peace will come from Kwame Nkrumah/* When released, their hero was carried shoulder high, to a special car, and with a police escort the maze of humanity moved at a snail's pace through the streets to the West End Sports Arena where an additional assemblage was waiting, increasing the number of spectators to over 20,000, Held high, cheered, praised, yes, worshiped, he was carried to the platform to join others of his party,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sheep was slaughtered on the platform and the feet of the discharged men were smeared with blood as a sign of the removal of past faults. The throng increased. Schools dismissed their pupils and business houses closed, bringing down a great deluge upon the already assembled masses. One small lad must have gotten lost, because I saw them handing him one to another over their heads to the outside. Addresses over, the flood of humanity flowed into the streets where police were busy directing traffic. A European police officer standing at a busy intersection was approached by one of the happy crowd who shook the hand at the end of the extended arm. Others standing by followed suit and for a few minutes the embarrassed officer found himself unable to continue his job.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Dominion Within British Orbit</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The governor of the colony has expressed his desire to consult Nkrumah about the new executive council. Nkrumah states his willingness to meet with him, but says, “The [new] constitution is bogus and fraudulent, but I think it is a stepping-stone to self-government. What the people of this country want is real political power to manage their own affairs, without leaving power in the hands of a single person appointed by an alien power, however paternalistic or kind. We the C. P. P. want dominion status within the British Commonwealth.” Foremost member of the opposition party (U.G.C.C.) says Nkrumah’s release will benefit the Gold Coast, but “the C. P. P. has climbed into power chiefly by means of misrepresentation of the aims and conduct of the founders of the United Gold Coast Convention”. Both parties are at one, however, in seeking a complete break from Britain's political apron strings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Education is the first concern of C. P. P. and in education-hungry Gold Coast it is universally popular; even, as they contend, it is better to have half-trained teachers than none at all. A close second on their base of operations is the removal of colonial laws restricting freedom of speech, press, assembly and of movement. They are not overlooking free medical services, better village housing, more piped water supplies and a minimum wage of £7 ($19.60) a month. At the present time Gold Coast workers earn about £3 or £4 ($8.40 or $11.20) a month, and £20 ($56.00) a month ranks as high pay. And in verbal conquest of its objectives the party is not specializing in soft-spoken diplomacy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“In a democratic country, if a political party is in the minority, it forms the opposition; if it is in the majority it forms the government. Coalitions with the other political groups in this country . . . will be dangerous. The party system must therefore be established . ,.. We expect to be obstructed by the maneuvers of British bureaucratic officialdom. Should such contingency arise, we do not rule out the possibility of another Positive Action. I am strongly of the opinion . . . that all party members of the assembly and ministers should surrender their salaries to the party and in turn draw agreed remuneration from party funds. This will prevent careerism and induce comrades in high office to live simply and modestly and thus be undivorced from the masses/’ With this declared prospectus by Nkrumah and his party the Gold Coast begins on its historic career of autonomy or self-government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was a beautiful sight when members arrived for the informal opening of the Legislative Assembly. (Only two members </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of the previous council</span><span class="font0"> had been re-elected by the people to the new parhament.) As they took their respective seats they threw the Town Hall into a maze of quilted color with their varied patterns of cover cloth, some native made and some British made.

<p><span class="font26">Religious &quot;Freedom” in Spain</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;1 In an effort to excuse the modern Spain of Franco, monstrous propaganda circulates free- JJ ly concerning alleged &quot;freedoms” possessed M there by Protestants to deceive discerning in- </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font21">dividuals. However, too much sound evidence to the contrary exists, of which the following is but another small example. About four years </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font21">ago, Dr. Zacarias Carles, director of the Span- J3 ish Christian Mission, provided the publication M </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font21"> of Los Angeles, California, with a 3 portion of a letter received from Spain. This Jj information, quoted by </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font21"> in its Sep Jj tember, 1947, issue, we reproduce in the same h form here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;On May 12th, 1945, in the Barracks of Mon- £ tefaro the recruits of that year swore aile- g giance to the flag. In Spain this ceremony has ► a great importance and is always preceded by J the celebration of the mass. Brother Jos6 Mo- £ rado manifested to his chief that in his mill- h tary attestation his religion was recorded as £ evangelical, and, for this reason, he asked that ► he be relieved from attending the religious h act of the Church of Rome. His request was &gt;&nbsp;not granted, and he had to go to the military ff parade- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“There he entreated that he be permitted to M leave the parade. He pointed out that he was M very pleasantly obeying all that was related ** to the military service as well as to his duties for the fatherland but that he refused to render to the Divinity a cult that is prohibited in the Sacred Scriptures. He was forcibly constrained to stay in the parade, and in the moment of the elevation of the host, when the bugler sounded the signal to kneel down, Brother Jose Morado remained standing. His chief ordered him to kneel down, but he remained standing—alone among the kneeling crowd of soldiers—closed his eyes and did not open them until the bugler sounded the rising signal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“When the ceremony ended, he was confined to the Detention Barracks. Brother José Morado was then, and he still is, ill from pulmonary lesion, for he had just been released from sick quarters to fulfill his duties in relation to the swearing of allegiance to the flag. On October 30th, 1946, he was court-martiailed for the offence of &quot;disobedience to the sound of the bugle.’ The prosecutor asked that the indictment be the punishment of six years and one day in the penitentiary. The defending attorney asked one year of correctional reclusion. Several Christians in Spain have solicited from His Excellence, the Chief of the Spanish State, the indult for our Brother Josi Morado.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The Big Schmidt Telescope Locates Astral Bodies for Study by 200-inch Giant Eye</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">TULY 1949 marked the beginning of a a gigantic project, the mapping of all the skies visible from the Palomar Observatory in California. Is the 200-inch mirror telescope, famous for its range into space eight times greater than any other telescope, to chart the heavens? No, because thy &quot;Big Eye”, in reality a colossal camera, photographs deeply but narrowly; a mere “peephole” of sky can be concentrated under its gaze. To perform such a prodigious* task it would require 5,000 years! But the sky atlas is expected to be finished in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">four years by</span><span class="font16"> another instrument almost as remarkable, the Big Schmidt telescope.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19510608_files/g_E_19510608-8.png" alt="" style="width:124pt;height:187pt;">
<p><span class="font15">jr.y/r s, j.95/</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">Designed as a “perfect complement” to the longer range 200-incher, the 48-inch Schmidt took almost as much time to ten years. It is located in a smaller dome, one-quarter of a mile from the 200-inch reflector. Purposed to pinpoint fields for the Big Eye to concentrate on, the Big Schmidt is often called ‘Scout’ and is engaged in some highly interesting performances of its own. About 300,000,000 years into space, photographic reproduction is flawless!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Big Schmidt is what is called a wide-angle camera. It can cover 44 square degrees of the heavens in each photograph. In comparison the Giant Eye is limited to one-fourth of a square degree or 15 minutes of an arc in each photograph. To understand this dimension, we are told that the moon is one-half a degree or 30 minutes of an arc in diameter. On a moonlit evening the queen of the night looms large, but if you hold a pea at arm’s length you can black out her silvery face. Even less area than this is pinpointed by the Big Eye. But the Schmidt covers an area hundreds of times as large and one-third as deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the total heavens, or celestial sphere, there are 41,259 degrees. Of this, three-fourths is visible from Palomar, the other one-fourth lying beneath the range of this observatory, in Southern Hemisphere skies. With less than a thousand plates the Schmidt will chart 75 per cent of the dome that has hung above man since his creation. Actually the Big Schmidt survey will constitute an unparalleled exploration into the unknown. While in a few places the 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson has penetrated the sky somewhat deeper than the Schmidt, this reflector is subject to the same limitations as the 200-inch. The result is that only about one per cent of the sky has been explored to the distant reaches of 300,000,000 light-years. (To translate this colossal figure into miles multiply by 6 trillion.) Discoveries which the Scout is making almost daily astound the men of science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An explanation of the construction or the Schmidt reveals the high hopes placed upon the new sky chart, and much of the reason for the 'success of photographs now delighting the astronomer. Designed by the optical genius Bernhard Schmidt, it is a combination of the two major types of telescopes, the refracting type and the reflecting type. In other words, it employs both a lens (refractor) and a mirror (reflector). It is said that the principle of telescopes was discovered by a Dutch optician named Lippershey. At first crude, the refractors were enlarged and improved by Galileo and others, until this type reached about the limit of its efficiency in the Yerkes 40-incher, Williams Bay, Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief fault common to all types of lens telescopes is an aberration called chromatism—“the fact the refracting lens splits the light slightly into its spectrum of wave lengths, thereby producing a colored fringe that makes the image hazy.” The reflector type of telescope, which is now the design of all the largest types, eliminated chromatism but in turn suffered from other aberrations. By designing a lens to change the direction of the rays before they reached the reflecting mirror, Schmidt managed to eliminate spherical aberration and another fault called coma which affects the rays of light falling on the rim of the mirror. It is coma that limits the useful reflecting power of the Big Eye. In the Schmidt, his object glass, called a correcting plate, directs the rays upon a 72-inch spherical mirror, which focuses at a point between the plate and the mirror. Here the well-defined photographs are made. It is because the Schmidt possesses the two essentials of telescopes in superlative degree, light-gathering power and resolution (the sharpness or distinctness of the images made), that its large-area photographs delight the astronomer.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>mapping ike Visible Universe</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The entire heavens are spoken of as the celestial sphere. This name has been employed because all heavenly bodies appear to lie upon a spherical surface. Its aweinspiring depth or height is not suggested to the eye. For example, the moon, a mere 238,000 miles distant, seems to decorate the same velvet screen as a star trillions of miles deeper in space. The 200-inch telescope is now penetrating this star-populated universe to a distance that staggers the imagination, one billion light-years. Light traveling at 186,000 miles per second could make the circuit of the earth 7½ times in a second. Yet the little sparklers on the darkened dome, appearing like matched gems on satin indigo, are vastly separated. For instance, the nearest known star to our sun, Alpha Centauri, is over four lightyears away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Into this depth or vastness the giant 200-incher, a 500-ton “precision star camera with a million times the power of the human eye”, will probe deeply into mysterious and hitherto uncharted realms. But with so much sky to explore, limited both by its field of vision and the number of clear nights in a year, what sky targets should it select? The Big Schmidt with its vast sweep and deep-seeing power was designed to provide the answer. Already the Sky Scout is turning in some astounding reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The largest star grouping is called a “galaxy” or “nebula”. They have also been referred to as “spirals” and as “island universes”, because great voids of space separate them “like islands in a limitless sea”. These units are vast. For example, the Milky Way galaxy, our own home in space, contains 5 billion stars, and extends like a disc or coin 200,000 light-years across. The Milky Way is thought to spiral or whirl like a Fourth of July pinwheel about a central nucleus somewhat obscured from</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">earth by cloud or dust masses. Thus our home has three motions, revolving around its axis daily, circling a minor yellow star, the Sun, every year, and moving with the solar system about the perimeter of the Milky Way Galaxy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One single plate of the Scout reveals 17 clusters of galaxies, “almost as many as all previous telescopes had shown.” Some are oval, others &quot;dwarf”. To our amazement, astronomers consider a galaxy with a bare 1,500 light-years in diameter and numbering less than a billion stars a mere &quot;dwarf”. In two of these, 200 individual stars could be distinguished. In the space beyond the Milky Way (extragalactic) single pictures by the Schmidt reveal as many as 15,000 to 20,000 galaxies—ovals, spirals, ellipses. Occasional photographs reveal these star clusters from the side, as one would view the edge of a plate, slightly bulging in the center. Dr. Baade, of Palomar, estimates more than 25,000,000 galaxies to be within the range of the Big Schmidt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is expected that the survey will reveal more about the novae &quot;(Latin, &quot;new”), which received their name from old-time astronomers, who, seeing them suddenly appear where no stars had been observed before, thought them &quot;new”. These stars burst or flare up suddenly to &quot;hundreds of millions of times their former brightness in a few hours or days”. The supemovae are as much as 10,000 times the magnitude of the ordinary novae. Novae are sometimes used to gauge the distance of a galaxy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sweeping everything, near and far, in its field of view, the Schmidt is bringing to light interesting phenomena in our Milky Way, and, closer home, within the Solar System. In July 1949 near the start of the survey it photographed what has been called the North America Nebula, an immense cloud of luminous gas in the Milky Way. Its contour resembles the North American continent. Another nebula called the Cone Nebula, found by the Schmidt and pinpointed by the Giant Eye, &quot;resembles a comet leaving a wake of black dust.” A huge, shining cloud of gas and dust, located in the constellation of Monoceros, the Unicorn, has been called the Rosette because it looks like a full-blown rose. Immense clouds of this opaque or cosmic dust (&quot;nebulosities”), photographed in entirety by the Schmidt, cover areas many times the moon's extent. One objective of the Schmidt is to find apertures or &quot;windows” in the cosmic clouds which obscure much of our galaxy, and thus permit the Big Eye to view the Milky Way's opposite side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In our own solar system what has the Schmidt discovered? The solar system is known to contain quite a few things besides Sun, nine large planets and their satellites or moons. Authorities state that it also contains &quot;at least two thousand tiny asteroids or planetoids, an unknown number of comets, and innumerable meteoric bodies of assorted sizes”. &quot;New members of the solar system, the little asteroids or subplanets, that circle around the sun, are being picked up by the score. Astronomers used to think these asteroids might be fragments of an old planet that once followed an orbit between Mars and Jupiter, and later broke up, because most of them circled the sun between these two planets. But now, with asteroids showing up all over the solar system, this idea may have to be changed.” The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font0"> has this to say about asteroids: &quot;[They] differ from the nine planets in several particulars, the most obvious being that of size. Only for the four largest have diameters been successfully measured. Using the great 36-inch Lick refractor, Edward E. Barnard in 1894-5 secured the following values: Ceres, 485 miles; Pallas, 304 miles; Vesta, 243 miles; Juno, 118</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">miles. He considered the last at about the very limit of measurability. . . . As for their shapes there are many reasons for believing'that they could not in general be spherical but irregular.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Two new comets have been found by the survey, one of which speeds in near the sun and out again into space on a circuit that takes only two and a third years. The other is now moving toward the sun and will come closest to it in January, 1951.” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—National Geographic,</span><span class="font0"> September, 1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this writing it is impossible to estimate the importance of a sky atlas charting the heavens around our earth to a depth or distance of 300,000,000 light-years. It is bound to bring some intensely interesting if not epochal discoveries. A little more than a hundredth of this realm has ever been looked at by man. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scientists </span><span class="font0">and others keenly anticipate the results of the survey. Besides conducting a voyage of discovery the Schmidt is “suited for statistical study of a large number of objects”. The sky atlas, which will contain 935 sections on 14- by 14-inch plates, in twenty volumes systematically arranged, will constitute a veritable storehouse of knowledge, an invaluable reference sheet for future discoveries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides information on the position, distribution, motion and brightness of stars and galaxies the Schmidt is expected to answer important questions by analyses of their color. For this important information each field will be photographed twice, once with a blue-sensitive emulsion and once with a red-sensitive emulsion. This in effect is &quot;equivalent to a rough spectral analysis”. Colors of extragalactic systems are important for their composition and remoteness. From the spectrums of a great many of the star systems, scientists hope to find the answer to the hotly debated “outward explosion of the universe” hypothesis offered to explain the &quot;red shift”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The &quot;red shift” is a characteristic of distant galaxies, particularly those on the outer fringe or limit of visibility. Analysis of light from these distant nebulae after it has been split into its component parts, ranging from blue or violet to red, as in the rainbow, and comparison of .these spectrums with the spectrum of known materials have divulged much information about their material and distance. A peculiarity about stars in the Milky Way seems to indicate that those approaching have a concentration of their spectrum toward the. blue or violet end while those receding show a shift toward the red. But all the most distant galaxies show a shift toward the red, the more startling because the greater the distance the more pronounced the shift. This has led to the theory that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the universe is expanding or exploding </span><span class="font0">away from the earth. In other words the “red shift” is thought to signify that light waves vary when the body is moving away at great speeds approaching almost one-twelfth the speed of light itself in much the same way that sound waves vary as their source, such as a locomotive bell, recedes from the ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What has already been revealed by these great telescopes has led some writers to the conviction that “there is order and plan out there”. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Collier’s,</span><span class="font0"> May 7, 1949) &quot;The growing Certainty that there is order and plan out there, no matter how far we go, is a tremendous aid to human faith.” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Reader's Digest,</span><span class="font0"> August, 1949) Another ends his article with these words: &quot;Not all astronomers are religious men; yet when the Palomar Observatory was dedicated, the program bore on its final page those well-known words from the eighth psalm: &quot;When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him?”—Contributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">THE committee wants to know if </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">J. </span><span class="font0">gangsterism in America is to gain supremacy over law-abiding citizens—and whether the criminal does have the upper hand?’ So spoke Senator Herbert R. O’Conor, member of the Senate Crime Investigation Committee headed by Tennessee’s senator Estes Kefauver, as that highly publicized body moved the scene of its activities to New York city on March 12,1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Crime is a cancer in the nation’s vitals. Its intricate organization was underlined by a United Press dispatch of March 15, concerning an alleged photostatic copy of a “master plan” chart outlining the attempt of a national underworld syndicate to gain control of all crime in the United States. A Fort Worth, Texas, grand jury was in reported possession of the chart. In the meantime, public office seekers fire eloquent threats at crimeland, while officeholders consistently miss the bull’s-eye. While one generation of political officials gives way to the next, the smug mobsters and gamblers remain complacently entrenched. Occasionally, an overt act, public indignation and an official crackdown combine to trip up an individual, as in the case of Salvatore T. Sollazzo, the basketball “fixer”. But the underworld empire goes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Shockingly, a general official tolerance in the face of knowledge of the great majority of underworld figures gives an air of legitimacy to their “occupations”. The gentle treatment accorded such “gentlemen” in Washington by the Kefauver Committee startled some observers, and this practice continued in New York. The New York </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font0"> commented on this on March 13, saying, “The surface respectability that racketeers and professional gamblers have achieved in American life was evident at yesterday’s Senate Crime Committee hearing in the Federal Courthouse. Two men, who in flouting the gambling laws had reputedly aided in the corruption of public officials or given orders for violence, took the witness chair and were as suave and well-mannered as their investigators.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of these latter individuals was Joseph Doto, known as Joe Adonis, often linked in the past with Brooklyn’s coldblooded “Murder, Inc.,”* killers. In this regard, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font0"> continued: “But Charles Lipsky, a retired businessman and ‘old friend’ of former Mayor William O’Dwyer, testified that he had found Adonis ‘an attractive young fellow with an engaging personality’.” The stage was set for the committee’s New York hearings amid all the spectacle &lt;if a Hollywood production. Newsreel and television cameras ground away, usually with a free rein. Noted exception was with Frank Costello, called the “prime minister of the underworldwho, when he would speak at all, demanded the television cameras be not focused on him, at least not on his face. Though called several times, Costello usually declined to talk at all, preferring to either stare dumbly at his questioners or answer hoarsely that he was suffering from a long-standing throat ailment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The procession of testimony to follow only enunciated the strength of the underworld encampment, the apathy of officialdom, and the smug complacency of the culprits. Charles Lipsky, Brooklyn businessman, claimed that a great majority of Brooklyn Democratic leaders were obligated to underworld primate Joe Adonis. James J. Moran, formerly a lifetime water commissioner and intimate friend of exMayor O’Dwyer, implicated himself by swearing he had seen Louis Weber, convicted policy racketeer, only two or three times in recent years. Weber similarly denied knowing Moran. Then# Gerald Martin, receptionist at fire headquarters, came in to testify that in two and a half years, while Moran had been first deputy fire commissioner, Weber had visited him some fifty times. Later testimony concerning bribes caused Mayor Impelliteri to force Moran’s resignation as water commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Three top officials of the New York State Police were subjected to the wrath of the committee for what appeared to be their willful failure to lay a hand on illegal gambling and violations of the liquor license openly carried on at Saratoga, New York. They admitted that the violations were obvious and well known to the state troopers, but limply argued that it was a matter for local police to handle. Under questioning, John A. Gaffney, superintendent of the New York State Police, was unable to produce or to tell what became of a comprehensive report on gambling at Saratoga which had been placed in his possession after subordinates had completed it for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Money, influence, political protection, clever lawyers, and where all else fails, strong-arm tactics, have served to nurture the crime monster to its present growth. The “monster’s” riders, cornered by the committee,. have masked discomfort and distress with unconcern. Some have defied authority and sneered at justice. But whether or not any of them are yet to be influenced enough by law, order and reason to change their attitude, thinking persons should be able to see beneath their veneered exterior. Furthermore, they should discern how the shoulder-padded, trim cut, smartly suited gangsters have influenced responsible officials in high places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For those who will be completely honest with themselves, there are Scriptural facts to consider. The severity of world conditions, emphasized by the total breakdown of morals and the flourishing success of gamblers, hoodlums and their lot, contribute to a mounting proof that these are the “last days”, likened to the times of moral breakdown that once overtook the forsaken people of Israeli “Hear the word of the LORD, O Israelites I For the Lord has a quarrel with the inhabitants of the land; because there is no fidelity, no kindness, and no knowledge of God in the land. Cursing, lying, murder, theft, and adultery—they break out, and one crime follows hard upon another/’—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hosea 4:1,2, An Amer. Trans.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Honest, decency-loving people will rejoice at the news of a new system of things now at the door. Long have they prayed, “Your kingdom come”; long have they anticipated the possibilities of a rule of righteousness by the “Prince of Peace”. Regardless of the dubious final results from more investigating committees, crime probes and crackdowns, the promised rule under Jehovah God’s ‘government of peace' lies immediately before this generation. To offset the woe-bringing and disheartening news of crime’s present dizzy spiral as reported in the daily press, it is now possible to open the Bible and see how the administration of this kingdom will soon annihilate the old corrupt order with all of its hangers-on and replace it with the new world of your heart's desire.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font27"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Bullfighting in Costa Rica</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake! correspondent in Costa Rica</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">H</span><span class="font21">IGH light of Costa Rica'S annual winter </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">fiesta</span><span class="font21"> (officially, from December 28 to January 1) is probably the world’s most unusual bullfight. To the outside observer some of the “unusual” features become at once apparent. In the ring, as the hour to begin nears; are some 500 men and boys of all ages. Some are dressed as clowns and some as women, providing reason to expect considerable entertainment throughout the afternoon. But one acquainted with normal procedure for bullfighting may ask, “Why all this unorthodox crew in the ring?&quot; Herein lies the first big difference in Costa Rican bullfighting: anyone who chooses may enter the ring and fight the bulls. The young fellows always like to show off in front of their girl friends, so their presence can be expected in force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;L The color, splendor and tense atmosphere mount, then break as typical bullfight music is punctuated by a bugle-blast. At one end a gate swings open obligingly before the charge of the day’s first bull, a huge black beast with powerful horns that have been shorn of their tips. He seems to know why he is there, and with his head low and hind hoofs high, starts for the first man in sight. A veil of humor overrules the general consternation in the ring. Though but moments before there had been About 500 would-be bullfighters present, many are now climbing the wall as though they had sudden business in the stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">C Among all the self-styled bullfighters present there are a few genuine </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">toreros</span><span class="font21"> who make an effort to stop the bull with their </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">capotes. </span><span class="font21">As the bull sights the red cloth, he halts, then madly charges toward it. Adroitly the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">torero </span><span class="font21">side-steps the animal—when he can! Often, however, he is scooped up by the bull's quick horns and tossed high overhead. Again unlike '‘orthodox bullfighting”, the men, never the bull, suffer the only casualties. Eight to ten bulls supply one afternoon’s thrills by exhausting themselves in rotation for ten minutes each. The only harm experienced by the beasts comes when an occasional &quot;Ferdinand&quot; refuses to fight. To stir him to action his tail is pulled or twisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;L Now the second, more ferocious bull charges to the crowd’s roar He hits a man squarely and tramples over him to head for the next victim. The trampled one appears dead or out, and as four men carry him to first aid by the feet and arms, the bull about-faces, scores another direct hit on the whole convoy, knocking the attendants down and on top of the Injured man. This is how they do it in Costa Rica. A water pool is provided in the center of the ring as a refuge for beleaguered bullfighters. The tide of battle and fury of the bulls has by now well populated this pool with soaking-wet men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;L The crowning achievement comes to a fighter who manages to ride one of the bulls, for which purpose a leather strap is fastened about the body of the bull and just behind the front legs. When a man rides the bull for any distance he becomes a hero in the eyes of the crowd, and is put up into the stands to walk around and receive gifts. We watch a daring young red-haired chap slip atop a bull and draw cheers after himself as he circles the ring. Passing near the stands, he is lauded and handed gifts by eager admirers. At the completion of the circuit the proud youngster's pockets literally bulge with money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;L </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ab</span><span class="font21"> the sun sets over the maneuvers of the last bull, the fight, or more appropriately the riot, closes to the exit of the homeward bound.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Be Baptized?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Go therefore, and make disciples </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">\_T </span><span class="font0">of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matthew 28:19,20, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> In apparent obedience to that command practically all professed followers of Christ Jesus practice some form of baptism. Some claim that baptism washes away original sin and so baptize infants. Others claim that baptism is the door to the church and so limit it to those mature enough to make a decision. Some baptize by sprinkling, others by immersion. Why should a person be baptized? when? and how?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For Christians Christ Jesus set the proper example. Was he baptized in infancy or did he and his disciples baptize infants? There is no record to that effect. Was he baptized for the remission of sins? No, for he had no sins. (Hebrews 7:26) Then why was he baptized? Let the Scriptural record answer: &quot;Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him. But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: T am the one needing to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?’ In reply Jesus said to him: ‘Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.’ ** —Matthew 3:13-15, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What did Jesus mean by the words “to carry out all that is righteous”? The apostle Paul, at Hebrews 10:5-10 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(New World Trans.),</span><span class="font0"> answers our question by showing that at that time Jesus carried out that which is righteous by dedicating himself to the doing of his Father’s will: “Look! I am come ... to do your will.” So instead of there being baptized by John’s baptism for the washing away of sins Jesus was instituting something entirely new, and that for his followers. And that is why, years later, when some Christian believers were found to have been baptized with John’s baptism they were again baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.—Acts 19:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to Matthew 28:19, 20, all who would observe the commandinents of Jesus should be baptized. Before they can observe his commandments, however, they must first come to a knowledge of Jehovah God and his purposes, repent of their wrong course of action, and accept Christ Jesus as their Savior and Redeemer. After having determined in their mind to do God’s will to the best of their ability, they may and should be baptized.—Matthew 16:24; Acts 3:19,20; Romans 10:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But is it necessary that baptism be by immersion? Is it not true that both general custom and convenience have caused immersion to be replaced by sprinkling? Yes, but convenience and general custom are not valid authorities. Note that immersion in water pictures one’s death to his will' and being raised out of it well pictures being made alive to the doing of God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Further, the very meaning of the words used are conclusive in the matter. The original Greek words have the meaning of immerse, dip, submerge and are so translated by such modern translators as Rotherham, Wilson and others. And while the words baptize, baptism, etc., have a religious connotation today, their originals did not have any such meaning. The Greeks, in using </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">koine</span><span class="font0"> Greek, spoke of a shipwrecked person’s being baptized, meaning that such a one was submerged in water. Also, the Scriptures tell that a whole world was baptized, at the time of the Flood (no mere sprinkling, that!) and that all the nation of Israel was baptized at one time, when they passed through the Red sea, walls of water being on each side of them and a water-filled cloud above them. Also, we read that Jesus and John chose places where there was much water to do their baptizing. Why have the crowds go to such places if sprinkling would have served just as well, and it could have been performed where the crowds were, in the cities?—John 3:22,23; 1 Corinthians 10:1-3; 1 Peter 3:20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And as for the baptism of infants. Not only is there no record of infants’ being baptized but in all the accounts of baptism performed by the apostles or disciples of Jesus we find that knowledge and the exercise of faith were prerequisites. Infants cannot receive such knowledge, much less exercise faith there! n.—Acts 8:34-38; 9:17-19; 10:44-48; 16:14,15,30-33; 18:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But someone will ask, What about those mentioned by the apostle Paul as being baptized for the dead? Does not that show that baptism is not just a picture of consecration? The text in question (1 Corinthians 15:29) reads, according to the if mgr </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">James Version:</span><span class="font0"> “Else what shall they, do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">First of all, let us remember that the Bible clearly teaches that the dead know not anything; that in death man has no pre-eminence above a beast; and that there are no changes in death, as the tree falleth there it shall be.—Psalm 6:5; Ecclesiastes 3:19,20; 9:5,10; 11:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Further, the apostle Paul, at Philippians 2:12 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(New World Trans.),</span><span class="font0"> admonishes us to “keep working out your </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font0"> salvation”. No one else can do that for us. The faith and works of others will not save one who is lacking in them himself. “For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.”—Romans 10:10, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If one cannot be baptized with benefit for others, and least of all for dead persons, then what did the apostle Paul mean by being baptized for the dead? The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font0"> makes the matter clear showing that the ones so baptized are baptized with benefit to themselves; they themselves are the “dead ones” referred to. Note: “Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of being dead ones? If the dead are not {o be raised up at all, why are they also being baptized for the purpose of being such?”—1 Corinthians 15:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Without doubt Paul is here referring to those followers of Christ who are baptized into the body of Christ; those who by faith, consecration and God’s action on their behalf, are made members of Christ’s body. Such are baptized for the purpose of being dead with Christ that they may also live with him, and are spoken of as being baptized with the holy spirit the way Jesus was at Jordan and as the early church was at Pentecost. If there were no resurrection of the dead then such would of all men be most miserable.—Acts 1:5; 11:16; Romans 6:3; 1 Corinthians 15:17-19; 2 Timothy 2:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus, in summing up we see that Christ Jesus commanded baptism; that it is required of all those who have agreed to do God's will (thus excluding infants); that immersion is the only proper form, and that those “baptized for the dead” are “baptized for the purpose of being dead ones”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">T</span><span class="font0">HE vale of Kashmir, the “Kashmiri Love Song” and the Kashmir (cash-mere) shawl have long made Kashmir one of the best-known provinces of India. In recent years, however, another Indian province and people have come to the fore and bid fair to eclipse Kashmir for international interest. It is the province of Hunza and its people the Hunzakuts (more generally, though less accurately, known as the Hunzas).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, compared with almost four million inhabitants of Kashmir, the twenty-odd thousand Hunzas seem insignificant indeed, but it is not a matter of size but of health. Yes, remarkable tales have been and are being told of the health of the Hunzas, and the reasons given therefor make the Hunzas a people of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Hunza province is situated north of Kashmir, where Afghanistan, Russia and China meet, in a valley between two mighty glacier-covered mountain ranges of The Himalayas, whose peaks average from 20 to 25 thousand feet in height. The province runs along about seven miles, at an altitude of some seven to eight thousand feet. Due to the remoteness of its location, shortage of food supplies and means of transportation few travelers have visited Hunza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the winter the land presents a depressing and almost lifeless appearance. All is barren and gray, with low overhanging clouds on the horizon, and the weather is so cold as to keep the Hunzas practically housebound. But from early spring, through summer and into fall, nature blossoms forth with profusion to present an ever-changing panorama of beauty, while the temperature rises to as high as 95 in the shade.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Hunza History</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Hunzas are a tall and light-skinned race, fairer than the natives of the northern plains of India. According to tradition they sprang from three soldiers of Alexander's armies who got lost in the gorges of The Himalayas in the fourth century B.C. The chiefs or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mirs</span><span class="font0"> claim to be descendants from Persian royalty that came to Hunza about six centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The language of the Hunzas is Burusha-ski, a language which has never been recorded and is not even written by themselves. It is said to be a perplexing tongue and not related to any other, thus furnishing no clue as to the origin of the Hunzas. The educated and ruling class use Persian, but the rest, about 99 per cent, are illiterate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There was a time when the Hunzas, although practically unknown to the outside world, were a terror to surrounding provinces. In those days they literally followed in the footsteps of their religious leader, Mohammed (in Medina), plundering desert caravans laden with treasure. All prisoners of any commercial value, men, women and children, captured in these raids were sold as slaves, either directly to the Chinese or to the slave traders, the Kirghiz. A British expedition headed by one Colonel Durand put an end to this state of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The last chieftain or mir to rule the Hunzas before the British took a hand in the affairs of Hunza was Safdar Ali Khan. He came to his throne in 1886 by poisoning his father (who in turn had also murdered his father) and throwing his two brothers over a precipice. He fled the country in 1892 to escape British wrath. Ali Khan thought so little of his subjects that he used them for target practice. And though thirty years of British supervision had passed at the time Sir Robert McCarrison (a British physician) spent a decade with them, yet there was little change in heart of the rulers. For, among other things, he tells that the mir objected to his efforts on behalf of the aged. Why not rather a lethal chamber by which to get rid of all these unproductive old folk? the mir reasoned.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Hunza Characteristics</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Hunzas may be illiterate, but they are not lacking in intelligence. They have, according to a Royal Geographical Society report, “charm, intelligence and physical stamina” and are the “most cheerful and willing set of men with whom we have ever traveled”. General Bruce, experienced mountain climber, tells that they are incomparable as slab climbers and “most charming and perfectly companionable”. Other travelers also comment on their self-reliant, intelligent people. TYft ‘ski.W tha zas in conducting warfare won the highest respect of the British soldiers sent to subdue them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The family life of the Hunzas is well-ordered and peaceful. A mother-in-law and three daughters-in-law will work from dawn to dusk without bickering or quarreling. Children are brought up in kindness and seldom interrupt their parents. As tots they learn to work in the fields and continue patiently throughout life. Moral standaids are high and divorce is rare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Hunzas are Moslems who agree with Mohammed that God knew that man was weak and so he made religion easy. They do not have a caste of priests but certain ones among them officiate at funerals, weddings, etc. One thing they do take seriously is their national pastime, polo, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font0">village has its polo field and teams of expert poloists. After working all day they will play a strenuous game of polo and think nothing ot it. They seem to know no fatigue, one writer states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Which brings us to their outstanding characteristic, their health. According to Sir Robert McCarrison, “They are unusually fertile and long-lived, and endowed with nervous systems of notable stability . . . The powers of endurance of this people are extraordinary,” and cancer, diabetes, appendicitis, the common cold, etc., are unknown among them. “Indeed,” he continues, “their buoyant abdominal health has, since my return to the West, provided a remarkable contrast with the dyspeptic and colonic lamentations of our highly civilized communities/’ Though surrounded by peoples afflicted with goiter and cretinism more than almost any others, yet the Hunzas are also immune to goiter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why are the Hunzas so healthy? yes, and why so remarkable in other respects also? And especially remarkable when we consider the fact that the neighboring peoples are as far "below the average mentally, morally and physically, as the Hunzas are above. It cannot be due to the high altitude in which they live, as the surrounding peoples also live in high altitudes. Nor can we lay the cause wholly to the fact that they are essentially a rural people. The myth that country boys are healthier than city-bred boys was dispelled once and for all time during the last war when statistics showed that in one year (1943) 36 per cent of all farm boys were rejected as unfit for the army, while less than 20 per cent of the city boys were rejected.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Reason far Hunza Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the factors doubtless having a bearing on the health of the Hunzas is the fact that they are a very poor people. They must live very frugally and therefore do not overeat. Meat is practically limited to that of goats and they may have it once in ten days or once a month, usually on feast days. Also, in contrast with surrounding peoples, and highly civilized peo-pies too, they are very careful about their drinking water. How many modern cities pour their sewage into the same river from which they take their drinking water! And, according to government reports, 75 per cent of the drinking water used on farms in the United States is unsafe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About 30 years ago Sir Robert McCarrison came to the United States at the invitation of the Mellon Society for Biological Research (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) to give a lecture on the subject “Faulty Food in Relation to Gastro-Intestinal Disorders”. In this lecture he called attention to the remarkable health of the Hunzas. But evidently the deductions he made from the facts he presented were too simple to be accepted and acted upon by learned members of the medical profession there assembled. What a paradox' modern medical science is losing its fight against degenerative diseases while the illiterate Hunzas are not even plagued with them! According to their mir, barring accidents, the Hunzas live to be at least 80 to 85 years old. Greatgreat-grandparents are very common.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dr. McCarrison gives four prime factors as the reason for the remarkable health of the Hunzas. First: “Infants are reared as nature intended them to be reared—at the breast.” Second: “The people live on the unsophisticated foods of nature:, milk, eggs/ grains, fruits and vegetables.” Third: “Their religion prohibits alcohol, and although they do not always lead in this respect a strictly religious life, nevertheless they are eminently a teetotaling race.” And fourth: “Their manner of life requires the vigorous exercise of their bodies.” In connection with their diet it should be added that dried apricots play a prime role. And of these four reasons, that diet comes first was borne out by experiments made with rats; those fed on the Hunza diet were as healthy as the Hunzas, and those fed on the prevailing diet of modern civilization developed the ills that modern man is subject to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Hunzas have been called “astonishingly intelligent farmers” and “the most painstaking of all husbandmen of Asia”. By means of terraces they make use of every bit of available land. There is no erosion of land, nor do their species of grain, fruits or vegetables die out. There is no such thing as “ex-orchard” or “ex-potato” land. Insects do not wreak the havoc that they do in Western lands. No question about it, their methods of farming are practical and produce healthy crops. And their healthy crops produce healthy Hunzas. With them it is quality, not quantity, that counts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For one thing, the glacier water they use is highly mineralized, and the silt from the irrigation ditches is applied to the land. Then, they also practice crop rotation. And further, instead of using commercial fertilizers they make the greatest possible use of all refuse, plant, animal and human. Nothing goes to waste. They even know enough to let their manures remain in a compost heap for six months before applying them to the land, thus allowing time for the elimination of harmful bacteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Hunzas seem to have learned how to make the best use of what little resources they have and to be content with it. Their remarkable characteristics demonstrate that a homely wisdom is superior to textbook knowledge. Hunza methods are being copied with good success. Surely others could also benefit from their example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, let us not forget that man’s problems are far greater than to be solved by any Hunza method. The Hunza may live ten to fifteen years longer than do others and his declining years may be without the buffering of cancer, etc., but eventually he too dies. Only God's kingdom </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">will </span><span class="font0">be able to make an end of all pain and death, and in His due time it will.—Revelation 21:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">MacArthur on Asia Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; One of the most controversial issues faced by the world’s governments has been what to do in Asia. Numerous nations have continued to provide the Chinese Reds with supplies while their own troops were fighting the Chinese communists in Korea. The ouster of Gen. MacArthur has brought this debate to a head. MacArthur wants an all-out effort in Korea, wants to bring Chiang Kai-shek into the fight against the Chinese communists, and argues that failure to press the Korean fight to £ conclusion would lead to World War III. The U. S. administration feels that Communist forces must be resisted, but that the Korean war should be limited so as not to imperil the defense of Europe through a growth of the Korean conflict into World War III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">MacArthur expressed his view before Congress May 3-5* Then Defense Secretary Marshall appeared May 7 to present the administration<sup>1</sup>^ view, after which other administration witnesses were expected to testify, and then MacArthur will probably be given the opportunity for a rebuttal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Both MacArthur's' proposals and the administration’s could lead to World War III. MacArthur and the republicans had one viewpoint. The administration and the democrats had another. Both may be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Big Four&quot; Wrangle</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; The job would usually take just a few days, but after more than two months of wrangling in Paris the “Big Four&quot; delegates had still failed to agree on the subjects the foreign ministers will discuss, if they ever get together for their proposed meeting. Despite the almost hopeless situation neither side wanted to conclude the talks and be accused of the responsibility for their failure. An April 25 tirade by Russia’s Andrei Gromyko insulting the other delegates was outstanding. He said, “There will not be room enough in Korea for the white crosses over the graves of the interventionist troops . . . Churchill’s statement [about U. S: arms deterring aggression] was the statement of an aggressor clanking with atomic weapons . . ■ Churchill's language is the language of Hitler . . . Churchill and his cannibalistic advocates such as Davies [British deputy] would make even Cleopatra blush.&quot; It was real news, however, when the delegates all agreed on one point' that they would not meet on May Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">May Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; “May Day” is an ancient celebration. It is a pagan festival that goes back long before the days of the Romans and the time when the Celts held a festival called Belfein (Baal’s fire) on the first of May. It has been adopted into so-called &quot;Christian” practices in various lands. In 1889 it was selected as an international labor holiday, and is noW a special Communist holiday* This year in Moscow it was celebrated with a gigantic rnili-tary demonstration. In Peiping more than 600,000 Chinese marched in a six-hour parade reviewed by top Communist leaders. In Teheran, Iran, the outlawed Communist patty (the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Tudeh)</span><span class="font21"> packed Parliament Square with 30,000 cheering demonstrators. In Berlin approximately 400,000 participated in the Communist parade and 500,000 in an anti-Comtnu nist demonstration. New York witnessed the mildest celebration in its May Day history, yet eggs, taunts, and a few cheers greeted the left-wing parade. In most of the world’s capitals similar demonstrations were staged under the false Communist slogans of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Government Spending</span></p>
<p><span class="font21"># In the discussion about the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Herbert Hoover, president when the RFC was established in 1932, argued (4/30) that its emergency need had long passed, since the depression has been replaced by chronic inflation. He feels there is no legitimate excuse to continue the. fantastic practice of lending government money to distillers, brewers, theaters, poolrooms and even snake farms on the theory that these loans are in &quot;the public interest&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This brings up the 1949 Hoover Commission report on government waste, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">found bad drganlzatlbn, scrambled information, duplication, red tape, waste and poor coordination in the government. Fifty per cent of its recommendations have now been approved by Congress to save probably $2 billion. The 18-volume Hoover report showed that at .that time one dollar in ten of federal funds was being wasted. It was estimated last March 10 that a saving of more than $5.5 billion annual* ly could be made if all the reforms recommended by the Hoover Commission were enacted. An illustration of this waste was the federal agency that had a 93-year supply of fluorescent bulbs and enough loosedeaf binders to last 247 years. In one department there were 24 supervisors for 25 employees. The Veterans Administration had 4 times as much man power per policy as did private insurance companies. Big government means big taxes. A waste of taxes is one cause of dreaded inflation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Vigorous Protests in Spain</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Fourteen years after Franco proclaimed his one-party state in Spain, Spaniards can look back to see that prices have risen twice as high as wages, that they are among Europe's most impoverished, and that rations are insufficient. In March Barcelona workers walked off their jobs in the first major strike under Franco’s dictatorship. For three days almost every factory and business in the city was closed. Then on April 23 Bilbao, the largest city of the Basque country, did the same. The government ordered strikers back to work at the threat of losing their Jobs, but 250,000 stayed out for two days. Similar strikes occurred in neighboring towns. About 30,000 workers in Pamplona struck on May 8 in protest to the notorious black market. Women paraded to the governor's pal</span><span class="font0">ace demanding that ration offi</span><span class="font21">cials be hanged. One Worker in Bilbao was quoted as saying: “We made our' protest. Now it’s up to the government to do something about it so we can live. . . . Don’t make any mistake. Tm not a Communist and I am not against Franco, but I want to live and I’ve got a family to feed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">“People’s Justice’* In China</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; The “People’s Government” of Communist China has resorted to “people’s Justice”, commonly called lynching. A nation-wide purge campaign set up February 20 continues to grow. In Peking 25 prisoners faced a howling mob of 5,500 persons. Often an uncorroborated accusation shouted by someone in the crowd will start the mob at these “trials&quot; shouting, “Shoot him,” “Cut his head off.” These mob trials have been broadcast over the Communist radio, and at one of them a voice shouted into the microphone, “Spit on them, ■ bite them, beat them!” Peasant militiamen taking landowners to the execution grounds is an everyday scene. People are hauled off trains and killed on the spot. Youths have cried for the execution of their parents, and parents their children. On April 30 the communists executed 376 persons in Nanking, and the previous day 343 were shot in Shanghai and Hangchow,</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Conditions before the communists in China were terrible. Mob rule is terrible now. Political change is not the solution. God's kingdom is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Argentina*^ Dictator a God ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">$ Apparently Perin’s wife' thinks her dictator husband is a god, for (according to </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Time </span><span class="font21">magazine, May 7) she delivered the following invocation before government employees assembled in Buenos Aires to thank Perón for a pay rise: “Perón is the air we breathe,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perón is our sun, Perón is life. </span><span class="font21">. . . I have pledged myself to collect the hopes of the Argentine people and empty them in the marvelous heart of Perón so that he may turn them into realities. The humble people, my general, have come here to prove, as they have always done, that the miracle that happened 2,000 years ago is occurring again. The rich, the learned, the men in power never understood Christ. It was the humble and the poor who understood, because their souls,, unlike the souls of the rich, are not sealed up with avarice and selfishness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Evolution to Switch Again T</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; The evolution theory has undergone many changes since it was taught by the ancient pagan Greeks, and today it still must be continually revised as new discoveries prove former theories false. In April Prof. Carleton S. Coon of the University of Pennsylvania produced evidence, in the form of three skeletons found in a cave called Hotu in Iran, that “modern man” existed at the same time that “primitive” types lived. The New York </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font21"> reported (April 27), “Consequently modern man may not have evolved from the Peking Man at all,” and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font21"> magazine said (May 7), “Backed up by further study, [this] discovery may upset the prevalent notion that modern man is descended from the subhuman [?] Neanderthal. According to Coon, the Hotu man, a true human (Homo sapiens), may actually have preceded Neanderthal.” Coon did say that this skeleton (which he thinks is 75,000 years old) had a smaller brain than present-day man, but its cranial capacity (1,150 cc.) was much larger than that of African pigmies (900 cc.), who are definitely human. Evolution continues to have to re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Blood Substitutes </span><span class="font21">(£&gt; Despite the Bible’s straightforward commands to ’abstain from all manner of blood’ (Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 3:17; 7:27; 17:10,11,14; Acts 15:20, 29; 21:25) a concentrated propaganda drive for transfusions continues to grow. On May 1 the Red Cross opened a new central headquarters in New-York thoroughly equipped to handle 30,000 pints a month, more than double previous capacity. With such large sums of money invested in this practice the Red Cross puts out a monthly </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Blood Program News* letter</span><span class="font21"> to propagandize its appeal for blood, and newspapers and magazines frequently aid this publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">An INS bulletin reported (May 9) a blood substitute known as PVP-Macrose, &quot;which if made generally available may virtually do away with the need for costly blood banks.&quot; It is being made in limited quantity by Schenley Laboratories, Inc., of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and further research on it is under way. Germans - used it under the name “Periston” in World War II, described its results as &quot;dramatic” and made no attempt to maintain blood banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In a world that thinks it is “smart” to discredit the Bible, that prefers evolution to God's Word, it is little wonder that those who abstain from violations of God’s law are often considered fanatics by godless persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Salvador Quake—Magnitude 6  </span><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; Seismologists, men who measure earthquakes, rate a quake’s Intensity on a scale which runs from 1 up to 10, a mark which has never been reached. The most violent recorded quake was 8.5 in Assam, India, in 1897. The August, 1950, quake in Assam which swallowed whole villages was 8.4. The San Francisco quake of 1906 was a fraction less. Seismologists rated the May 7 quake in El Salvador as magnitude 6. Early estimates were that 1,000 lives had been lost in the city of Jacuapa alone, and hardly a building was left standing. Other cities were seriously damaged. Thousands were injured and 20,000 refugees were under government care. This was the most destructive quake in El Salvador's history.</span></p>
