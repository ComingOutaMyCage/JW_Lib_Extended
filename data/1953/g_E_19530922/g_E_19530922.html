<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font33"><a name="bookmark21"></a>To Get Them Back to Church</span></h3>
<p><span class="font39">T</span><span class="font28">HERE was a time when a drugstore sold drugs, a five-and-ten-cent store confined itself to low-priced merchandise, and in the country church one heard preached the &quot;old-fashioned religion,” Now times arc changed! All three of these &quot;businesses&quot; stock many more articles. One ran purchase Ribles and Rih)e literature in the drugstore or the flve-and-ten, and he can even go to church and eat a* meal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">If you enjoy syrupy hutcakes and coffee on Sunday mornings, but you would rather not get up and prepare them, then hear the ‘‘call&quot; of this Chicago church, as reported in the Philadelphia </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">Enquirer</span><span class="font28"> of March 9, 1953, under the heading, “Oddities in News”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">&quot;The Midwest Bible Church started a campaign to Increase attendance today by serving free pancakes and coffee to 600 breakfast guests. The guests attended after they had eaten their fill. As part of a Midwestern Lenten drive to increase Sunday School attendance, the church plans to feature different attractions each week until Easter. Next Sunday, 2,000 helium-fillcd balloons will be released from a parking lot next to the church. On March 21 and 22, a blimp will hover 200 feet above the church with streamer promotions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Is there Scriptural support for these Sunday morning repasts? There come to mind the two essential free meals that Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Jesus served to the 5,000 and 4,000 weary travelers. But where is there any similar: ity in this Chicago church affair? Christ fed those who had followed him on foot and had listened until a late hour. The</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font28">spiritual f'</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font28">came first, then the material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Also Jesus perceived the real motive of</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">material-food seekers: &quot;Most truly I say to you, You are looking for me, not be-' cause you saw signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied. Work, nut for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for life everlasting.” —Matthew 14:13-15; John 6:26,27, New WorM Trans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">The miracles that the Master performed were for the purpose of glorifying bis heavenly Fattier, for identifying who the Son of God was, and in fulfillment of Bible prophecies. He did not stoop to offer drawing cards for Increased membership by planning different “attractions&quot; weekly, but he concentrated on one dear message, the kingdom of God. “The Law and the Prophets were until John. From then on the kingdom of God is being declared as good news, and every kind of person is pressing forward toward It.&quot;—Luke 16:16, </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">How foreign to the Scriptures and to real Christianity are the varied theatrical presentations and entertainment programs of modem religious organizations! In their misguided quest for mure followers the tentacles of organized religion reach out into the political field, commerce, sports, the theater, and even into the restaurant business! Just to keep their customers satisfied, for without such efforts they might not keep their customers. There are proper places to discuss politics and receive advice on voting, but the church is not one of them. “My kingdom is no part of this .world/’ said Jesus* Commerce is not to be carried on in buildings dedicated to God, for Jesus said further: “ ‘My house will be called a house of prayer/ but you are making it a cave of robbers/’ Bingo parties, movies and athletic contests are certainly out of place in church. As for elaborate church suppers or “free pancakes,” the apostle Paul reminded: “Certainly you do have houses for eating and drinking/* -^Tohn 18:36; Matthew 21:13; 1 Corinthians 11:22, </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">“Jack of all trades, master of none” is a popular axiom that appears to aptly fit Christendom’s conglomeration of religions. The one work that Christendom is obligated to do—by her name and by her possession of God’s Word—is sadly overlooked, and left to a small minority to carry out: “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (Matthew 24:14,</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font28"> In the midst oFfamine-ridden Christendom during the past seven decades there has arisen a rapidly growing group of gospel-preachers to fulfill this divine prophecy and command.<sup>f</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Jehovah’s witnesses, called by some “the world’s fastest growing religion,” need no revivals to increase attendance at their meetings or assemblies* From some hundreds at the turn of the century they now number over 510,000 active ministers in 143 lands, and each week they hold Bible studies with at least a half-million others* They rise early on Sunday mornings and devote several hours in distributing spiritual food to truth-hungry people at their homes. They appear regularly on* the streets following the example of Jesus and Paul, “keeping a tight grip on the word of life/* using every possible avenue to provide the public with &quot;the food that remains for life everlasting.” (Philippians 2:16, </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font28"> With true worship as their only drawing card, their ranks continue to swell, both in their individual Kingdom Hails and at great national and international assemblies. The increasing numbers come because they know they will benefit from the real spiritual food that is offered freely* Jehovah’s witnesses are living proof of the fact that when such is offered, inducements like coffee and hot-cakes and balloons for the kiddies are not needed*—</span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">Contributed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">REGARDING COMMERCIALS</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">When advertising executives recently met in Los Angeles a district represent-atfve ot General Electric said; &quot;Television commercials have almost reached the</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">point where I don’t believe a doggone thing I hear on the air* For instance, we have not manufactured a certain vacuum cleaner for twelve years. Yet it is being</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">boosted on TV as the latest thing*” A swelling volume of dissatisfaction is heard from viewers and commentators. Among them is </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Advertising Age&gt;</span><span class="font25"> which said TV</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">is mortgaging '&quot;its wonderful prospects” “by the acceptance of high-pressure scarcely credible, and scarcely honest advertising that observes the rules of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">1870 pitchman</span><span class="font25"> [a public novelty venderL and practically nothing else.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font28">proud when</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">time when a man had just reason someone referred to</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font28">to be him as a bigot. As first used, some eight centuries ago, the twin was applied to &quot;men who were staunch lovers of freedom. Concerning these we read In </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">What Price Tolerance?</span><span class="font28"> (Paul M. Winter), on page 340:</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">&quot;Rollo, the first Duke of Normandy, when commanded tn kiss the foot of Charles ITT, the Simple, King of the West Franks, in return fbr the province of Neustria, declared, ‘Ne se, bi gott’—(Not so, by God!) This oath by Rollo earned for the Normans the title Bigotti, and later changed to Bigots. According to the twelfth century chronicle the Normans remained steadfast in their fidelity to each other, much to the dismay of King Charles.” Yes, as used then, those freedom-loving Normans had just cause fur pride in their title &quot;Bigots&quot; even though not intended as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Today, however, the term is one of shame, for instead of referring to one who insists on his rights of conscience, it refers to one who would refuse to grant others those rights, to one who would practice injustice and intolerance because of his religious beliefs. Thus Webster defines bigotry as “obstinate and unreasoning attachment to one's beliefs, with intolerance of beliefs opposed to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">A striking case of bigotry in modern times has been featured in the French press, particularly since March, 1953. It ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font28">concerns itself with two Jewish orphans, Robert and Gerald Finaly, who were but three and two years of age when their parents were apprehended by the Gestapo agents of Hitler on February 14, 1944, never to be heard from again. It seems that the father turned his children over to a Catholic foundling home run by a Mile, Antoinette Brun. An aunt nf the boys located them in 1945, a year later, just after the war was over, and asked for their return, but Mile. Brun, having determined to make Roman Catholics out of these Jewish boys, refused to turn them over to their closest living blood relations. Three years later, when the hoys were seven EUld six years old, Miss Brun had them baptized into the Catholic Church. In 1949 the relatives of the Finaly boys presented a mandate in the French court asking for the .boys. After almost four years of legal battling, the French court ruled in favor of the Jewish relations and against Catho-</span></p>

<p><span class="font28">Brun obey the court’s the boys over to their No, she refused to give was arrested. When the</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">pulice came for the boys, they were nowhere to be found, fur she had arranged with Catholic priests to smuggle the boys from one Catholic school to another until finally they got across the French border into Spain, where Miss Brun and her coconspirators felt the boys would be safe from the French police. Within a month seventeen Frenchmen, including six Roman Catholic priests and two nuns, were</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">either in jail or out on bond because of being involved in the disappearance of the two boys.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Attempts at </span><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Justification</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">A Catholic priest, who had been arrested for his part in smuggling the boys across the French border and into Spain, claimed that his action of running off with these boys could, not be termed kidnaping because the boys themselves were in sympathy with his </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">actions</span><span class="font25"> and did </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">not want </span><span class="font25">to be turned over to their Jewish relatives; also that “their only regret was not to be able to write their mother,” Miss Brun. But Miss Brun is not the mother of the boys, and had she not kept them since 1945 in spite of the objections of their Jewish relatives, those boys would not have felt the way they did about wanting to remain with their Catholic guardians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font25"> magazine, March 16, 1953, which reported on this matter, did its best to minimize the gravity of the action and its blameworthiness by implying that there was doubt as to the wishes of the parents in the matter of the religion of their offspring. True, the boys had been circumcised, but </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font25"> questions whether it was done for health or religious reasons, and says that the father had not specifically stated whether he wanted his children brought Up as Jews or as Catholics. But let </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font25"> ask Catholic parents how many of them would want to have their boys raised as Jews and it would know, since it seems not to know at present just how Jewish parents would feel about having their boys raised as Catholics. To advance such arguments merely reveals how weak the case is for Roman Catholic Miss Brun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Miss Dorothy Thompson, American columnist, regrets the issue that has been raised, dwells at length on the hospitality of those taking in Jewish orphans and describes the incident as that of a French court asking that Jewish boys, who had become Catholics, be returned to Jewish relatives, But how had these become Catholics? After having these boys just one year, the relatives requested their return. By what right did Miss Brun refuse to give them up? Is that what their parents would have wanted? By this action was she not in effect robbing the dead parents of their children?</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Miss Thompson speaks of the love that </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Miss Brun-had for these boys, but does lows </span><span class="font25">for orphans manifest itself by changing their religions as radically as from Jewish to Roman Catholic, when they are too young to know what religion is all about; and especially to do so in the face of bitter opposition from the orphans’ closest relatives? Miss Thompson speaks of the boys’ disappearing in spite of the efforts of Catholic authorities to recover them. Despite </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font25"> efforts to recover them, yes; but despite Catholic efforts? Would six priests and two nuns have gone against the orders of their superiors in such a matter had their superiors really wanted the boys returned to their Jewish relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Did not the aunt ask for the custodyjaf the boys when they were but four and three years old, only a year after Miss Brun had taken them in, and in spite of which she persisted in catechizing them, making Catholics out of Jewish boys and then having them baptized three years later? Miss Brun may </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">talk</span><span class="font25"> much about the fove she had for these two Jewish orphans, the “most abandoned” of her charges, but it is apparent that religious bigotry, a desire to gain converts for her church, and not love for the children, their rights and the rights of their relatives, was the motive prompting her.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Repercussions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">Baron Guy de Rothschild, head of the international banking house and lay leader </span><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">or French Jewry, expressed the way the </span><span class="font25">Jews, particularly those in France, felt about this Finaly affair. He pointed out that the Jewish community would never accept the forced conversion of the Jewish boys and that whereas for years this matter had been a private legal battle between the relatives of the boys and the Roman Catholic social worker who had become their legal protector, “Now, within a few weeks, the private persons have passed into the background and one finds engaged in this affair the French Government, the Catholic Church and all of Judaism. Simultaneously the case has jumped into the forefront of the news and has provoked so much violent feeling and so much passionate debate in public and private meetings and in all circles that one is tempted to give it an importance analogous to the Dreyfus or Petain cases.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Baron de Rothschild continued*. “Nonrestitution of the Finaly children to their family and their conversion to Catholicism constituted one of the worst abuses of confidence vis-a-vis their unfortunate parents. . . . Too many priests have played an active role in the Finaly case for us to hesitate in incriminating the entire church, which is a highly organized and hierarchized body.” The New York Times, which carried the foregoing expressions of the Baron, concluded its report with the following significant observation of its own: “Several Roman Catholic officials and lay persons have criticized those who baptized the children for violating canon law, since it was done without parental authorization. There has been no direct criticism by a high church official of those who have hidden the children.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">True, the archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Felton, asked for the return of the children, but why? Because what had been done was in violation of the principles of Christianity and justice, not to say anything of its being in violation of canon law? Not at all, but merely because the law should be obeyed. He, however, prefaced the remark with a request for clemency for those involved in this kidnaping and forced conversion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">The Finaly affair was taken seriously not only by the Jews and Catholics of France, but also by French liberals. Said the New York </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Times;</span><span class="font25"> April 15,1953, on this aspect:</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">“Paris Group Warns Church on Powers. Sees Case of Jewish Orphans as an Attempt to Assume a Temporal Role.” Referring to numerous Catholic statements, none of which, however, emanated from high officials, to the effect that the church had a right “to assume physical control over baptized children, the manifesto issued by about thirty educators and writers declared that it represented 'an offensive to restore a doctrine that gives the church, in addition to Its sovereignty over suuts, an ill-defined portion of secular government also.’ The manifesto said that in accordance with the French Constitution the church’s spiritual mission gave it no right to intervene in civil matters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">The New York </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font25"> further observed that in the face of growing protests against the way the Catholic Church has handled this whole affair, the Jesuit monthly, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Etudes,</span><span class="font25"> manifested a much-remarked softening in attitude. In this publication a Catholic priest, Robert Rouquette, asked “whether it was in fact the duty of the modem church to take baptized children away from unbaptized parents or relations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">What does this indicate? That only because of the pressure brought to bear by popular opinion aroused in righteous indignation at the Dark Ages policy pursued by the Catholic Church has there been a softening in her attitude. In other words, it is all right to steal Jewish infants from their dead parents by baptizing them as</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Catholics before they are old enough to know what is involved, and in spite of the pleas of their relations for their return, until an outraged public has to be reckoned with—then be willing to question whether, after all, such things are right or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Christ Jesus commanded that we were to do to others all the things we wanted others to do to us. (Matthew 7:12) Would Catholics want their children taken over by Jews, raised as Jews? Christ Jesus also commanded not to prevent parents from bringing the little children to him, but do we ever read of his authorizing the forcing of children to be brought to him in spite of the objections of their parents or closest living relatives? (Mhrk 10:13, 14) If a church were following those principles of Christ, would it be necessary for her to be forced by an unbelieving world to do that which is right?</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">On April 16 the press reported that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received a communication from Spain to the effect that it would return the children only if Miss Brun and the Jewish children had reached an agreement, which actually amounted to siding in with the kidnaper of the children, Miss Brun. Then France’s highest court upheld the decision that the orphans should be placed in the custody of their aunt in France. Forty-eight hours later (June 26) they were returned. Under an agreement between the cardinal primate and the grand rabbi the boys are to live with their aunt until they are 21, when they will make their own choice between Judaism and Catholicism. The robbing of dead parents was defeated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">VATICAN MISSION STILL A MYSTERY</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">When Myron C. Taylor was appointed the personal representative of President Roosevelt to the Vatican, it left the impression that there was a vital need for such a mission. In 1948 Mr. Taylor published the book </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Wartime Correspondence Between President Roosevett and Pape Pius XII</span><span class="font22"> in an attempt to prove the importance of the Vatican mission. Yet the contents of this book revealed no good reason for the existence of the mission; the lofty and pompous words of mutual esteem left one in a fog. What was the need for such a mission? The book offered no clue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But the mystery only heightened when Mr. Taylor published a book on the correspondence he handled between President Truman and Pope Pius XII. Not long ago </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century,</span><span class="font22"> May 13, 1953, tried to .find a clue that might justify the existence of a Vatican mission. The magazine commented on Taylor's recent book:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“If the summary of its contents published in the New York </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font22"> on April 27 is adequate (and the </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font22"> reporter evidently was trying to find </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">something</span><span class="font22"> of interest to quote) the whole exchange consisted Qf more unexceptionable remarks on the importance of religious faith in the pursuit of peace. Writes Mr. Truman to the pope: 'We must employ every resource at our command to bring to this sadly troubled world an enduring peace, and no peaee can be permanent which is not based on Christian principles.’ The pope replies in kind. Mr. Truman replies in kind. The pope replies in kind. And so on to a final exchange of admirable Christmas good wishes. What reason was there here for the services of an ambassador? Or even of a 'personal representative’ whose office expenses ran to about $40,000 a year? After all, the overseas airmail service is the best postal service we have, and overseas airmail stamps cost only 15 cents.”</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font22">ciety Assembly of Jehovah’s </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnssn now </span><span class="font22">Is history—and what history! </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">For eight </span><span class="font22">days an average of 130,000 Christian ministers from 96 different lands filled Yankee Stadium, occupied the overflow tents or assembled at (he assembly's Trailer City, near New Market, New Jersey, some 40 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The climax of the assembly was reached on July 26 when 165,829 assembled at four o’clock hi the afternoon to hear the public address of the president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, on the widely advertised subject, ’'After Armageddon —God's New World.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Sophisticated New York gaped in amazement that a Bible convention could attract such crowds and marveled at their orderliness. As one policeman expressed it: ‘'These people pravlicv what they preach!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">96 Land A</span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"> fte </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">present fid</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Emphasizing the assembly’s world-wide scope were the names of each of the eight days: &quot;Earth’s Four Quarters Day,&quot; “North America Day,<sup>1</sup>* &quot;Islands of the Atlantic Day,” &quot;South America Day,” “Asia Day,&quot; &quot;Africa Day/’ &quot;Europe Day/’ and &quot;Islands of the Pacific Day.” Each day’s name was lettered on the grass in front of the speaker’s platform together with the number of lands and ministers in those lands in that part of the earth. The reports of branch servants and niis-</span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">nesses came </span><span class="font22">from Canada, upward of 800 </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font22">England, </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">287 </span><span class="font22">from Germany, etc., for </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font22">total of some 22,000 fiorn 95 different foreign lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">During the assembly discourses were given in twenty languages besides English. Attendances al such meetings ran from 54 for the Albanian lo 4,075 for the Spanish public meeting hold on Sunday, July 26, 1 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Within the Stadium</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The international aspect of the assembly was also emphasized by 90 signs fastened on the girders around the stadium, on which were greetings together with </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">a suit</span><span class="font22">able illustration for each land. Among these were: Harvest in Philippines </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Great! </span><span class="font22">South Africans Present </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Leap </span><span class="font22">for </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Joy! </span><span class="font22">Japan Blossoms in Holy Array; Though Divided—Still United, Germany; </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Love </span><span class="font22">Penetrates Iron Curtain. Behind the bleacher section was a beautiful sign, 70 by 12 feet, that carried the welcome by the United States* witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Concerning the platform setting the New York </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font22"> July 20, 1953, said: &quot;The transformation of the Yankee field was wholly remarkable. Home plate was covered by a cluster uf sixteen amplifiers, hanked with potted plants. The pitcher’s box became a circle of red, white and yellow blotssoms. The orchestra was seated behind second base with an upright golden harp where the hag would be. Spreading</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">around from first base to third was a </span><span class="font25">mAss array of ager&amp;tum, marigold, geranium, lily, petdnla, hydrangia, dahlia and scarlet sage. A clear fountain played all day near the spot identified with second basemen. . . . Most impressive, separating infield from outfield, was a green barrier of balsam fir, espaliered in the form of a castle’s parapet, with jutting watchtower.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Spiritual Food</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">The New World Society Assembly certainly provided a rich spiritual feast for Jehovah’s witnesses. Its theme was struck b$r its president, N. H. Knorr, in his Monday afternoon speech, “Living Now as a New World Society,” in which he forcefully outlined the history, purpose and progress of this society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Throughout the assembly the discourses stressed the various aspects of living now as a New World society. It means engaging in a pastoral work of feeding Christ’s “other sheep&quot;; it means walking in the name of Jehovah our God, putting that name ever to the fore; it also means fleeing now before Armageddon makes it too late to flee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Repeatedly the ministers were reminded of their teaching commission and particularly the requirement to teach from house to house. The purposes to be served by this ministry were noted. New World society training of children, the manners of its ministers and woman’s proper position were discussed. The need of having an unselfish motive and having one’s acts directed by the living Word of God was also brought home to the assembled ministers, Stressed also were the privileges of full-time activity and especially that of the missionary; and special and pointed instructions were given to the various groups of full-time ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Increased light was shed on Gog, he being Satan the t)evll himself; “the desire of all nations” of Haggai 2:7 was identified as the men of good will now taking their stand; the founding of the new earth dates from 1919 when spiritual Israel was freed from modem Babylon.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>New Publications Released</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">New publications of the Watch Tower Society are often released at an international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, and this assembly was the best yet, 75 publications having been brought forth in many different languages. The three major English releases were: “iKafce Sure of </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">All Things?’,</span><span class="font25"> a 416-page pocket-sized Bible handbook containing more than 4,000 quotations of Bible texts under 70 main themes; the </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures,</span><span class="font25"> Volume I, consisting of the first eight books of the Hebrew Scriptures known as the Octa-teuch; and the 384-page Bible study aid, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth<sup>33</sup>,</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Three English booklets were also released: </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">“Preach the Word<sup>33</sup>,</span><span class="font25"> which gives a Kingdom witness in 30 languages; </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World,</span><span class="font25"> prepared especially for missionaries in Oriental lands, yet valuable for all encounters with Bible doubters; and the booklet containing the public lecture, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">After Armageddon—God’s New World.</span><span class="font25"> Four new timely tracts were also released and also four issues of the assembly’s 16-page newspaper, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Convention Report of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>23 Assembly Departments .</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">The New World Society Assembly was well organized. Several months before it began, the work of obtaining rooms was brought under way. Close to 50,000 rooming accommodations in private homes were obtained; some 35,000 witnesses stayed at hotels, one hotel alone accom-</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">modating 1,900; and upward of 45,000 stayed In tents and trailers at Trailer City. About 5,500 took port In looking for rooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In the Trucking department 60 tracks, </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">ranging from half-ton to double trailers, </span><span class="font22">were volunteered and operated by 289 workers. Forty expert technicians took care of the sound department and publicaddress system, which utilized 250 loud-s peaks </span><span class="font23" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lb</span><span class="font22"> and three miles of wire, and with the help df the telephone company tied In both Trailer City and WBBR to the assembly's programs. The music was furnished by an orchestra of 77 skilled musicians under the able direction of V, R. Duncombe, who also led the singing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The cafeteria, operated by 4,500 willing workers, was a model of efficiency that amazed outsiders with its capacity of 30,000 mealfl per hour. A lieutenant from a nearby naval base came to see how it was done, with n. view of using such n system “in case of bombings or other disasters.&quot; Ln the refreshment stands, 5,500 volunteers supplied conventioners with sandwiches, milk, soda water, ice cream, co flee, “hot dogs,” etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The First Aid department, consisting of 20 doctors and a staff of nurses, took care of the emergencies and minor mishaps, which were very few considering the size of the crowds, the weather and other circumstances. Among other departments were “Attendant” (Usher); Press and Public Relations; Cleaning; Convention Reporting; Engineering and Installation; Bookroom; to mention but a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Provision was made to translate the lectures into the sign language for the 60 deaf-mutes that attended, and also to put the lectures on tapes; some 11,000 tapes, each containing two hours of lectures, were ordered. Radio Station WBBR had a staff on hand to tie in the programs with its own whenever possible and to make </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">recordings for broadeasting at such times as the assembly was not in session.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">And all this work was done without a single cent in remuneration, all giving their skills and abilities because of their low for Jehovah and their neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Trailer Citg</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">A considerable segment of the New World Society Assembly found itself at Trailer City, where, on the last Sunday, 49,027 heard the public lecture. Situated 40 miles from Yankee Stadium, near New Market, New Jersey, it covered 200 acres, on which 1,500 trailers were parked and 6,000 tents were pitched. Laid out in streets and avenues, which bore Biblical and other names associated with Jehovah's witnesses, it bore a Now Worldsociety look. Registered as staying In Trailer City were 45,453.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">For its various departments 78 buildings were erected, which, if placed end to end, would have stretched out a half mile. Eight miles of pipe were laid, and 23 miles of electric wires supplied light and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The New York </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune,</span><span class="font22"> July </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">21, </span><span class="font22">1953, in reporting on the assembly and Ilie Trailer City, under the heading “A City Is Burn,” had, among other things, the following to say: “In a close-mown 160-acre whcatficld at New Market, N.J., 30,900 Witnesses have settled down and created the nation’s politest, neatest and certainly newest municipality”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Other Conuvttiion High Light*</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">An outstanding feature of the assembly was the resolution offered at the conclusion of the president’s Monday afternoon speech, “Living Now </span><span class="font23" style="font-variant:small-caps;">as</span><span class="font22"> a New World Society,” in which resolution were highlighted: that Jehovah’s witnesses recognize that 1914 marks the date of the establishment of God's heavenly kingdom; that the New World society takes no part in</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Crowded stadium showing Sunday afternoonSbublic lecture attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">any political activity, disavowing all subversive movements and the use of violence in the overthrow of governments; that it is united in one common bond despite differences of language, race and nationality; and that regardless of opposition it will continue to bear witness to Jehovah’s name, his supremacy and kingdom. The resolution was seconded by convention chairman Percy Chapman of Canada and adopted amidst thundering applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Another assembly high light was the immersion. On Wednesday after the discourse on baptism 4,640 persons of good will indicated that they had dedicated themselves to do Jehovah’s will, and these were baptized. Special buses took these candidates for immersion to the Riverside Cascade Pool, where two teams kept busy immersing for five hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead was made prominent in the assembly. Not only were its missionaries on the program every day, but the first day of the assembly was largely given over to them. In the afternoon 127 students from 28 different lands forming the 21st class were graduated and given missionary assignments in 44 different lands. (Picture of graduating class appears on page 15.) In the evening the graduates gave a two-hour demonstration of Gilead life, telling about their studies, classrooms, etc., as well as furnishing a very interesting musical program, consisting chiefly in folk songs of the various nations from which they came, by which they depicted how they relaxed while at school. A particularly effective feature was the impersonation by one at the women students of Mary Magdalene on. Jesus* resurrection day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">On Thursday afternoon missionaries from past, present and future classes combined to provide a very colorful pageant in native costume in which eight different very effective answers were given to the question: “How do you witness to Oriental people and cultivate interest in the Bible?” Included were branch servants’ reports from Burma, India, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Pakistan, Singapore and Thailand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">And still another striking feature of the assembly was the streamlining of the work carried on by the traveling representatives of the Watch Tower Society, known as circuit and district servants, and the emphasis that these are to place on the house-to-houSe preaching activity in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Publicity</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">The publicity &gt;that the public press gave Jehovah’s witnesses immediately before and during the assembly was by all odds the best that it had ever given. The reports were quite friendly and generous in space; by the morning of the last Sunday of the assembly 6,000 column inches on the convention had appeared in New York papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Weeks before the assembly began the Brooklyn </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Eagle</span><span class="font25"> gave a good news story telling of the quest for rooming accommodations made by Jehovah’s witnesses. And on the first day of the assembly/ in addition to news reports it featured more than a full-page story entitled </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">“Jehovah’s Witnesses:</span><span class="font25"> From Brooklyn to Armagbd-don. Their Message Is Warning of Final Battle and Promise of ‘Wonderful New World to Come*.” By picture and word it told of the headquarters home, factory, radio station, and rather objectively discussed what the witnesses teach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">The Sentinelj</span><span class="font25"> a weekly published near Trailer City, gave pages of publicity to the assembly, particularly as represented at Trailer City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">For a more detailed coverage of the New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses we refer our readers to the 96-page </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Convention Report</span><span class="font25"> for 1953.</span></p>

<p><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Colorful Indians of Ecuador</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!” correspondent in Ecuador</span></p>
<p><span class="font34">I</span><span class="font22">N THIS little South American country of Ecuador, in the jungle west of Quito, between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, is a spot that the Colorado Indians, some of earth’s most colorful people, call home. Once numerous, it is estimated that now only about three hundred are left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Tliree of us in company with two American naturalists went to see them. The trip itself was as absorbing as the Colorados. We went up and out of Quito’s valley until the magnificent and brilliantly green mountains surrounded us. They were cultivated to the very tops in neat, measured squares. Oxen strained powerful muscles pulling plows on their steep sides. A llama was silhouetted on a mountain. Then clouds began drifting in white mists between the mountains and filling in the. valleys below. At times we could see only the road ahead of us. The grandeur of the mountains was hidden and the white cloud-mist turned the visible world into a fairyland. Gigantic trees were weirdly shaped by hanging moss and vines. We stopped for lunch and stretched our legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Baek in the bus we raced down narrow mountain roads, and that night reached tiny Santo Domingo. The next morning we struck □ut for the jungle to get an intimate view of the country of the red people we were to visit. The path zigzagged down a steep hill to a roek creek of clear, fast-moving water. The mammoth trees overhead came together and shut out the sky like a great, green, leafy roof. Glorious birds waited in the branches above us. Blue and black butterflies eight or ten Inches across ignored us in their flights among the trees and vines. Insects sang and buzzed. Overgrown, painted beetles in green, blue and red crawled from under leaves and rocks. Scorpions hid under bushes and centipedes lay along leaves and branches. Monkeys chattered in the trees well out of reach; animals hid. The gleaming colors of tropical flowers made a dream of the underbrush. </span><span class="font23">*1? </span><span class="font22">Painted Colorados make an unforgettable splash of color in the dark green of the jungle. Their bodies are completely covered with a red so bright that it startles the eye. The hair, too, is scarlet. It is rubbed full of what at first appears to be red clay, but turns out to be </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">achiote,</span><span class="font22"> a small red seed that readily gives up its color just by touching it with the hand or mixing it with water. The Colorado smears his body and hair with this dye. He molds it into his hair so well that it looks like a bright plastic cap that comes down almost over his eyes. It is cut straight around, even with the eyes, and the back is shaved up to that line. The Colorado’s face is striped horizontally with black stain. Chest, arms, legs, even feet and hands are decorated with black and blue stripes and dots over the red. With a sharp yellow shawl over his shoulder and a scarlet red sash holding up a black-and-white-striped sarong, his dress is complete. Some Colorados. however, add wide gold bracelets, and top their red hair with a straw ring like a twisted doughnut dyed in bright colors. The women decorate their bodies, too, but leave their hair black and long. They wear only a striped cotton skirt with dozens of strings of brass and colored beads,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">*8? </span><span class="font22">They are a happy people, honest and respectful. A traveler told of spending the night in a Colorado hut. His horse was fed, watered and tethered, and he was invited to slfcep in the Indian’s bedroll. He awoke with a start. The hut was empty. He dashed outside, confident he had been robbed of everything, including his horse. But there he saw ^Jus horse, tethered under the hut, and the Colorado family was asleep in a lean-to they had thrown up so the stranger could be comfortable in their hut by himself. Their little huts generally house families of five or six. But if one member dies, the hut and all possessions of the dead one are burned. The family moves to another spot and builds another hut. The Colorados have no books to disclose their history. Their legends are told in their own peculiar tongue and seem to reveal an ancient connection with the tribes of the sierra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">*8? </span><span class="font22">In this green jungle with strange animals and brilliant birds these painted Indians are fast disappearing. They live not only at an end, however, but at a beginning, for the Almighty who made possible such an interesting variety in man, animals and all nature has promised that under His kingdom the beauty of the earth will be focal].</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font33"><a name="bookmark35"></a>TELLS WHAT AILS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font39">T</span><span class="font28">HE &quot;old fashioned” pre-elect ronic doctor was often a man of integrity who used souxid judgment to give sound advice. His equipment was perhaps crude, but it was used with groat skill acquired by diligent work in college and as an intern. Today’s doctor is not limited by etude equipment. 1 Ie can use electronic equipment tn diagnose and even to treat his patient’s ailments. This equipment is no substitute for skill and sound judgment, but il can be of great benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Each day seems to bring forth more of this equipment. Many of these diagnostic machines write down in a chart form the information they ftynish. The names nf these machines usually end with &quot;graph/' meaning that they draw or write. Thus they tell the skilled physician what aiis you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Suppose a doctor believes a pattent has heart trouble. To verify this he may use a device that records the action currents produced by the patient Is heart as it pumps the blood. This is possible because the muscles of the heart expand and contract, setting up action currents. A highly trained expert, then analyzes and decodes the information that the machine has supplied. Many heart ailments can be accurately diagnosed by this process, and it is widely used today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Heart ailments are also detected by the use of sound amplification. This method tells the condition of the heart valves by the sound they make. The sound is used to produce a graph that shows, for example, which valves arc more or less leakv. With T&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">this device not only heart sounds can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER 195^</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detected* and recorded</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">► &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also those of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">\ lungs and stomach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Another device used in </span><span class="font33">YOU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font28">obtaining information</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">about the heart records ....... the state uf fullness of the blood vessels, and, thereby, the heartbeats. Also, a record can be made of blood pressure, which may give more Information about the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">When the heart pumps it produces considerable mechanical force. If the patient lies on his hack, there is enough force developed to move the whole body. This movement can be detected and recorded by means uf a pickup device laid over the shins 'and fastened in place. Thus from these various ways of checking the action of the heart the doctor can obtain invaluable information about cardiac conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">The liftiin</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Electronic devices ar? used to record the electrical activity of the brain. These devices are comparatively new, and the various electrical waves sent out are not understood completely. However, the knowledge based on experience and experiment is growing, and this has become an important tool in diagnosis of many conditions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to diagnose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Brain wave signals have been compared with frequency-modulated (F.M.) radio signals, ft is thought that this prevents other electrical discharges from interfering with them. Small metal electrodes are held to the scalp by a drop of collodion. A small shielded w’ire from this connects to the input of a sensitive amplifier. The signal is amplified enough to operate a recording pen or stylus. These devices have been able to locate brain tumors and to diagnose various forms of epilepsy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">An interesting diagnostic method is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">recording of electrical potentials produced when muscles are active, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a</span><span class="font25"> smaN needle with an insulated shaft and bare tip is thrust into the muscle. The small exposed area at the tip permits contact to be made to an individual muscle fiber or a group. By means of an amplifier the potentials are displayed on the screen of an oscilloscope to be seen and photographed and also converted to sound by a loud-speaker. Most of the signals are produced in the muscle when contracting; the sound heard in the loud-speaker sounds like machine-gun fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Then there are machines called stimulators that produce electrical signals that are used to test nerves and muscles to find out if they are intact or have been damaged. In other fields of electronics this would be called signal tracing. Normal test signals have been established for all the major muscles and nerves so that they can be used for comparison in future tests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">It is possible to test liquids by means of a photoelectric meter, which measures the amount of light passing through the solution. For instance, samples of blood or urine are treated chemically to produce a solution in which the depth of color is used to indicate the presence or absence of various substances. The meter then indicates the depth of color. This technique is highly accurate and is accomplished rapidly.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>X Rays and Fluoroscopes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">X rays are used to penetrate what we think of as solids. Simple X-ray equipment is composed of a high-voltage transformer and a vacuum tube that contains a cathode producing electrons and a tungsten target. When the electrons strike the target, the X rays are produced. Various types are built to produce X rays that will do the particular work required with the least expense. Skilled doctors know how to use them with perfect safety to the patient and to themselves. Their major use in diagnosis </span><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">has been to take pictures of broken bones and abnormalities of internal organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">The fluoroscope is another use for X rays by addition of a fluorescent screen to view the bones or organs immediately and directly without photography. The patient is placed between the X-ray tube and the fluorescent screen. This diagnostic method has been limited by poor visibility and lack of definition. But now by adding the modern science of television the former limitations have been overcome and this tool will be more valuable.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Electronics in Treatment</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">Electronic devices not only tell what is wrong, but are also used in the treatment of various ailments. Electrotherapy is the use of direct current and low frequencies of pulsating direct and alternating current. The therapy is not really new. The electric eel and the torpedo were known in the Nile and Mediterranean long ago. But very little was known about electricity and just what these fishes produced. However, many ancient physicians prescribed shocks from one or another of these fishes for various illnesses, so that electrotherapy is really very old indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">There are several common types of ^lec-trotherapeutic waves, such as galvanic current, pulsating galvanic, surging galvanic, slow sinusoidal, etc. Results from these various currents may be increased circulation, destruction of tissues (bloodless surgery), infusion of drugs into the tissues, and stimulation of muscles and nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Electric shock therapy consists of applying current to the brain for very brief periods of about two tenths of a second. In certain types of mental disorders, strong medicines were used to provide a great crisis to jar the nervous system and brain, thus bringing relief. Now this is being tried by electrical means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">It has been found that a malignancy like cancer can be destroyed by X rays. Many</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">ways barebem devrod to apply the X rays where they are wanted witbout burning adjacent tissues. Since the hums can be disastrous, skill is required in the applies’ tian of X rays for beneficial results. This </span><span class="font22">is done by timing, shielding and directing the output of the X-ray tube. A normal tissue Is always rebuilding worn-out cells and repairs any minor bums due to this or any </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">other cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Short-wave diathermy is the use of radio waves to produce heat or an artificial fever deep within the tissues. Heht has been recognized and used for centuries to aid the curative powers built into the human or* gun Ism. It Is now known that heat, light and radio are all similar electromagnetic waves. Heat can be used as an aid to recovery when produced by heat lamps, electric heating pads, radiant electric heaters, steam baths, exercise, massage or even a red-hot stove or open fire. The type of malady and condition of the patient would determine which application would be best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Langer radio waves were formerly used in diathermy, but today the short waves are in favor. In this therapy, production of heat Is felt by the patient and the benefits derived can be ascribed to this heat and the increased How of blood that it causes. This blood brings more leucocytes and antibodies to fight off infections at a particular place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ultrasonic Wave*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Ultrasonic waves ore sound wu^es &gt;.kjsc vibrations are so rapid that our </span><span class="font22">ears cannot respond to them. These.and other sound waves can travel in air or liquid and most solids. Therein they will be absorbed and reflected. Some work has been done on using ultrasonic waves in cases of neuralgia. arthritis, infections, malignant tumor^ ulcers, prostate trouble and asthma. The results are encouraging and more re* search is looked for. The action is much like a deep vigorous massage that generates heat in the tissues and so is also called diathermy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In diagnosis, ultrasonic waves can also he used tn easily detect when the stomach, bladder and kidneys nre full or empty. By a technique similar to radar, gallstones, kidney and bladder stones can be detected with ultrasonic waves. This method will surely have a part in a future system of competent and accurate electronic diagnosis of ailments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Numerous other diagnostic instruments are available to the modern physician, such as those that detect alcohol in the breath, the blood flow in the stomach, and locate bullets or other objects imbedded in the body. But by a discusion of the moat important ones it is obvious that today’s physician is better qualified to answer his patient's question * “What ails me, Doctor?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">WHAT A LUMP OF “GLASS”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Today’s largest cut diamond is the Great Stir of Africa, a flawless jewel weighing exactly 5163 carats/This enormous gem la cut from the mammoth Cullinan diamond. The fabulous Cullinan stone was discovered in South Africa In 1905 by a mine captain. It la said that he took Lite diamond to Ute mine's- president, Sir Thomas Cullinan, and was presented with a cheek for $10,000 posthaste!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">But the mine had a problem. Who would buy such a monstrous diamond?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Their problem was solved when the government of the Transvaal bought it to present to Edward VII of England on his siity-sixth birthday. The selling price?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It is reported to have been SSDO.OOO! Of course King Edward wanted to see this gargantuan gem of 3,100 carats before it was cuL Upon handling it the king remarked: “This is a great curlaslry, but I should have kicked it aside as a lump of glass if I had seen it on the road!&quot;</span></p>

And what is the value of the numerous “wonder foods” that so often become a fad?</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Cure-alls, both mechanical and medicinal, are almost everywhere. Some manufacturers stay within the law by not misbranding the product, Others take a chance with advertising. As soon as the atomic age came bursting in, quacks began to capitalize on the widespread belief that atomic energy could work miracles in medicine. The charlatans borrowed some of the wonder words from the new vocabulary of nuclear fission and soon were high-salaried experts in the art of quack healing. With the weirdly named medicines and fantastic-looking gadgets, the quacks pulled the wool oyer the eyes of the health-seeking public and cold-bloodedly fleeced their “patients.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Quack nostrum peddlers had reaped such a rich harvest that by 1949 the Food and Drug Administration announced that federal inspectors were being kept busy by a boom in “atomic remedies.” They seized such fake remedies as radioactive bath salts, an “atomic” shin-plaster, an “atomic” drinking water called U-235, and a device that sold briskly at $50 each<sub>4</sub> on the claim that it emitted “Z-rays”^ that would lengthen life by “expanding the hydrogen atoms” of the body.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font25">Radioactivity, wrongly used, is not a healer but a killer. So federal inspectors are genuinely relieved when they find that most quack “atomic cures” are merely worthless. It was advertised that one product known as “vrillium” emitted germkilling rays. It was made of small cylinders supposedly containing vrilfium. Prominent businessmen and politicians bought them, paying as much as $300 each. When federal agents seized this “germ-killer” they discovered that the cylinders actually contained a cheap rat poison. When Barnum said there was a sucker born every minute, he might have added that there was a quack born every hour to fleece them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">One “atomic” device called Atomotrone is said to sell for about $300. Actually it is a kitchen cabinet containing filters and sun lamps. Drinking water is placed in the cabinet and “irradiated” for twelve hours. According to testimonials one pint of this tvater </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">has healed people of high blood pres</span><span class="font25">sure, and doses in various amounts have cured heart disease, ulcers, arthritis, diabetes, cancer and many other chronic diseases. Promoters of such “atomic” cure-all devices find fertile soil in the people who shy away from medicine and drugs. They also hit “pay dirt” when they sell them to people of a certain religion. Then to stimulate sales they can say to new prospects that many people of “your religion” have them. Just why a device has</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">to be an authentfecure-all because others of “yow relieion<sup>1</sup>’ have it is never explained/But it makes a good selling point</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Those Formidable Machines!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Not ail quack devices profess something “atomic.” Some feature flashy appearances and corn plicated-loo king dials. Other quacks, knowing that there is a measure of successful and legitimate use of radio frequencies in treatment, induce the gullible to believe that an electronic machine has been invented to cure all the ailments that afflict mankind. Whenever a quack says the principle is radio waves, too often people, without investigating, immediately believe a device Is capable of extraordinary powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Radio engineers have made some enlightening statements regarding radiohealth “instruments/<sup>1</sup> One said: “Many formidable machines without any scientific justification but apparently with much psychological and 'box-office' appeal, have been used for years by quacks and charlatans, the modern versions of the medieval mystics. One of these electrical gadgets supposedly was based on a theory that disease causes the body to radiate electrical energy at some specific frequency peculiar to that disease. The same machine diagnosed and likewise treated all diseases.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">This machine, called Radloclast, was investigated by the Police Radio Bureau of a large City. And a reliable magazine (fiadio </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Craftj</span><span class="font22"> February 1944; now called </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Radio-Electronics)</span><span class="font22"> published the results of this investigation, including the circuit diagram and the rta^ons why the claims made for it could not he true. The machine sold for $1,000 and was supposed to detect, diagnose and cure everything from double vision to a bone in the coion. However, an analysis of the circuit diagram showed tha t the machine could not really function in that manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The patient holds an electrode in his hand, and the doctor, with one hand, rubs his fingers over a little glass plate and turns dials and knobs with the other. When the doctor “tunes in” to the disease, he is supposed to feel some resistance to this stroking; due to the effects of the “vibrations” on the glass plate. Then the doctor takes his readings, looks them up in a little black book and names the disease. It is noteworthy that this machine makes no graph or chart as do the reliable diagnostic machines mentioned in the preceding article. But the Radioelast, with its complicated-looking panel and classy appearance, sets at rest the doubts of even skeptical people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">One competent radio engineer of Indianapolis Police Radio Bureau who tested the Radiociast with the best instruments stated that he could not find </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;any kind</span><span class="font22"> of energy or vibration frequency on the detector plate.&quot; Professors of physics, radio men and others submitted to tests and found that they were diagnosed as having certain ailments. They also discovered that diagnosis went on uninterruptedly even when they secretly released the electrode supposed to conduct “vibrations<sup>1</sup>’ from Iheir bodies to the machine! However, on newer models a meter informs the operator when the patient releases the electrode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The Rad ioel ost’s Instructions blandly stated that to give a general treatment all dials may be set at zero. “The thoughtful engineer would indeed be willing to admit that, for all the tuning the various sets of variable resistors might be capable of, it would certainly be just as well to leave them all nt zero!”—</span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Radio Craft,</span><span class="font22"> February 1944,</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Then there is the “Spectro-Chmme&quot; machine. It sold fur S90 to $750. It was claimed that it would stimulate the pituitary gland, energize the liver, build hemoglobin and promote digestion, Lu say nothing of killing worms. United States mar-</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">How can quack devices be lawfully made and sold? The answer is simply this: Most manufacturers make no claim whatever for their machine. And there is no law against putting together some tubes, wires, resistors, colored lights and then selling the contraption. The law of averages, or better phrased, Barnum's law, makes the sale. Then the users of the machine, mostly doctors, make all kinds of incredible claims.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Detecting Quacks</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">Cure-alls never do what they claim to do. If they did, fewer people would be dying of disease. In fact, it would seem that the people who are always buying cure-alls would soon start living forever without needing the benefits of God's kingdom. But they die like other men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">What is the grave danger in cure-alls? This: That people with serious diseases may fritter away valuable time hoping to find the quick cure. Instead they get the quack cure. Then if the disease is really organic, the quack remedies fail. Finally, in sheer desperation they run for competent medical aid. By then it may be too late; the disease, beyond cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">To avert this disguised danger, fake remedies must be recognized. But how? If there is something inexplicably “mysterious” as to how the healing is accomplished, be on guard! When the advertising appears sensational, appeals more to the emotions, and overwhelms you with printed testimonials to the exclusion of sound principles, be careful! When one furthers the sale of a remedy on the basis that it is used by those of “your religion/’ beware! But the surest method of all is to note carefully the claims. If the Implication is there that something Is a cure-all, watch out! Competent doctors do not make extravagant claims. Quacks usually do.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>But Those Testimonials!</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">How are they obtained? Many testimonials are bought outright. It is simply your signature for cash. Other testimonials are faked. But many are given in good faith. To understand why so many people freely give testimonials one must realize that there are many functional ills. These may be caused by fears, frustrated desires, anger, hatred and anxieties. On this point C. Raimer Smith's book, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">The Physician Examines The Bible</span><span class="font25">, enlightens us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">“It has been estimated that about 50 per cent of the ills of the human race today are functional in nature; that is, there is no underlying pathologic change to account for them, but they arise from inner mental conflicts. . . . Pains of many kinds and in almost any part of the body—headache, backache, paralysis, blindness, indigestion, palpitation, convulsions and many other symptoms—may be functional with no organic defects present.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">But to the patient the symptoms are as real and disturbing as any symptoms of organic origin. So he visits one doctor after another, finally winding up in the clutches of some quack who is eager to “treat” him. “The quack caters to his subconscious emotional conflict and if the patient has faith in the procedures he will be 'cured’. Faith seems to be the key that will unlock the door of the subconsciqus and release any emotional complex stored there. So far as the patient knows, he is sick. He cannot distinguish between a functional symptom and one that is due to organic disease.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Thus many who are “cured” of their functional disease eagerly offer testimonials. With testimonials and advertising the quack is in business. Because man’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">nstinctive desire for health and life is so rrepressive, it often propels him to grasp </span><span class="font22">it </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">any cure. Quack healers expkflt this in-itlnctive desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Secret formula medicines often tempt the gullible. List year the'Pure Food and Drug igents forced the maker of Old Chief medi line to stop claiming ft cured everything Tom nervoutmebB to fatness. Old Chief, by the way, is made out of skunk cabbage, cat-ilp, hops, com silk, mistletoe, hunjetail jrass and marshm allows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Vhey Use Food like Medicine/</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">There are people who depend upon a food to cure serious diseases. They may be lopriving themselves of the opportunity Tor proper treatment. Hence, using food for medicine may be as dangerous as visiting quacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Food promoters grow rich because of the sensationalism of their advertising. A fad starts when a concern puts on an “efit more campaign?’ One year the public must Bat three cakes of yeast a day for pep, vim, vigor and vitality. Soon they are advised to switch to raisins to get their daily iron. Another “eat more campaign” says It must be yogurt or. spinach for the cure. Soon a new concoction must come to the fore to replace the product the people have sickened of. No wonder! People gulp down such mammoth doses, often to the neglect of vital foods, that they tire of the concoction. But the public continues to be deluged with screaming pronouncements about the health-giving qualities of this or that food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">What is wrong with the “health” foodf * </span><span class="font22">Nothing. Some of them may be exceptionally nutritious. But often they just cannot live up to their </span><span class="font22" style="text-decoration:underline;">claims.</span><span class="font22"> The unvarnished fact is this: “The beat medical opinion is that they [ the wonder foods] offer nothing one cannot obtain less expensively from ordinary foods?’—fn </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">the Name of Science, </span><span class="font22">by Martin Gardner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">When food becomes a medicine, eating becomes a chore; and that takes much of the zest from life. Also, those who overdo health consciousness arc usually not very pleasant people. So while some, because of iUnesis, may need a special diet, the key for the average person is moderation and variety. Variety in food </span><span class="font23" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ie</span><span class="font22"> not only more pleasurable, but It brings a well-balanced diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Food faddists harp on “going back to God’s original way for healing?’ But did God bring in disease? Did Jesus heal with foods? No! Adam’s sin and resultant Imperfection made all human creation subject to disease. God’s original remedy is not food but the Ransomer and King, Christ Jesus, and the new world that he will usher in after Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">So the primary danger in overdoing health consciousness is that it can become a religion. It may take one’s mind oft the only cure-all, the only genuine remedy; Jehovah’s new world. Do not allow anything to sidetrack you from the narrow road that leads to life. For only God’s kingdom by Christ can fulfill this promise of perfect physical health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Dirty Law</span></p>

<p><span class="font34">T</span><span class="font22">HE manta, largest of all the rays, is a Ilttle-known-about fish inhabiting the Florida reefs and other tropical waters. Poor Mr. Manta! He is often maligned. People call him by all manner of uncomplimentary names such as &quot;devilfish,&quot; &quot;sea bat&quot; or &quot;blanket fish.&quot; Sometimes he is even accused of forcing pearl divers down to the bottom of the sea with his giant batflke wings, whereupon he proceeds to iiine on succulent human flesh. Since Mr, Maijta has such a terrible reputation, would it not be interesting to take an unbiased look at this weird fish?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Mr. Manta is really a curious creature, but the first glimpse of him might be somewhat repulsive. But he is not truly hideous,, just odd. He is a broad, fiattened-out creature with eyes located on the upper, dark-colored surface of the body, and with mouth and gills located on the lower, light-colored surface. Actually, the manta resembles a fantastically huge bat; hence the name &quot;sea bat.” The manta uses his big pectoral fins just as the bat uses its wings in flying and in a wavy, graceful manner propels himself smoothly beneath the water. How long are the &quot;sea bat's” wings? They sometimes reach a width of twenty-two feet from the tip of one pectoral fin to the other! And the manta carries plenty of weight: he can exceed 3,000 pounds! \</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Not only the wings give the manta a frightful appearance, but the tail region is also queer, it being reduced to a slender, whiplike organ that the manta uses as a rudder. (The sting-ray uses it as a special protective device.) But why is the manta maligned with the name &quot;devilfish,” a term also given to the octopus? This is because the manta’s pectoral fins are different from other rays in that, instead of being attached to the aides of the head, they are free, projecting forward. When rolled up they look like a pair of curling horns. Thus Mr. Manta was dubbed &quot;devilfish.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Now when the manta’s pectoral fins are not rolled up, they meet below the mouth to form a scoop—very handy at dinner time. Small fish approach near enough to the manta to be captured because he so closely approximates the color of his surroundings. But since the manta’s mouth is on the lower surface of the head, the prey cannot be directly seized by the jaws. So the giant fish darts over its victims so as to covfer and hold them down with its blanketlike body; then with its scoop the victims are rapidly swept into its hungry mouth. Mr. Manta prefers, however, a diet of animals that come in hard shells. This is because his mouth contains blunt teeth that seem to be specially adapted for crushing the shells of mollusks and crustaceans. Rays, being gregarious fishes, frequently swoop down in large numbers on oyster beds—to the dismay of the owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Is the manta really a vicious creature? Well, if harpooned it will make the “sport” a dangerous one, for with its great strength it can pull a light fishing boat through the, water and with its enormous wings deliver crushing blows. But if not attacked the manta is a docile creature. There seems to be no sound reason for labeling it a &quot;man-eating killer of the sea.” Its batlike appearance has probably given rise to many superstitions. Some tropical pearl divers have a superstition about a blanketlike fish that attacks and devours men after enveloping them in its great pectoral fins. But the manta with its blunt teeth would hardly seem to be a man-eater. One staunch defender of the manta, who completely discounts its bad reputation, writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&quot;As the manta approached our raft it seemed like a gigantic shadow which had the appearance of a huge bat or bird flapping its wings and swinging its long, thin tail as it ‘flew’ slowly along on top of the water. As the ray swam right into shore In shallow water, it caused panic among the bathers who fled out of the water. Sometimes manta 'rays would encircle horrified swimmers in shallow water. However, the docile but ferocious-looking creature harmed no one. and we could even swim with them side by side much to the amazement of some of the bystanders on shore. There have been some authentic cases of lads on fishing boats slipping a noose around a hooked manta ray in the water and mounting on the creature’s back going surf riding, keeping its head up with the reins!”—Contributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Timing Christ’s Return by Bible Chronology</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">OD had a set time for his Son Jesus to come to earth: “When the full limit of</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">the time arrived, God sent forth his Son/’ He also had a set time for his Son to give his life as a ransom for all: “Christ, while we were yet weak, died for ungodly men at the appointed time/’ (Galatians 4:4; Romans 5:6; 1 Timothy 2:6, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.}</span><span class="font25"> Christ Jesus himself recognized that God had set an “hour” for his death and so he avoided his enemies until that time.—Luke 4:29, 30; John 7:1, 30; 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">We should therefore expect to find a definite time appointed by God for Christ to return. And not only that, but since God previously indicated the exact year that his Son was to appear as the Messiah and even the exact day he was to die, is it not reasonable to expect that he would also prophetically record the exact time of his Son’s second presence? Did Jehovah really give such details regarding Christ’s first presence? Yes, he did, by the prophecy found at Daniel 9:24-27, wherein seventy weeks of years are marked off for Daniel’s people, sixty-nine of which were to elapse from the commandment to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem to the coming of the Messiah, and which found their fulfillment in the 483 years from 455 B.C. to A.D. 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">However, we are not to expect the exact date of Christ’s return to be stated in so many words, no more than the Scriptures mentioned the date A.D. 29 as the year of the Messiah’s coming. The prophecy that primarily indicates this date in cryptic phrase is in the form of a dream that God gave to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., and which dream God caused Daniel to interpret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">In this dream the king saw a great tree that reached to heaven and could be seen over the entire earth, which furnished food for all mankind, in whose boughs the birds dwelt and under whose shadow all beasts took shelter. This tree ‘a holy one from heaven’ commanded to be cut down, but its stump was to be left in the ground. Seven times were to pass over this stump, during which it was to lose its human heart and be given that of a beast; the purpose of it all being that “the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men,”—Daniel 4:10-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Daniel applied this dream to King Nebuchadnezzar and in him it had its first or miniature fulfillment. Twelve years after he had this dream, on a day when Nebuchadnezzar boasted about his achievements, he lost his reason, became like a beast, eating grass as an ox for seven years. Then his reason returned to him and he gave praise to the God of heaven. —Daniel 4:19-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Certainly this prophecy was not recorded merely to tell us of Nebuchadnezzar’s madness. Rather we must conclude that it is part of ‘all the things that were written aforetime for our instruction, that through endurance and comfort of the Scriptures we might have hope/ (Romans 15:4, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font25"> We know that at Isaiah 14 Satan the Devil is picbired as the king of Babylon. And since at Ezekiel 28:12^19 Satan the Devil is pictured as at one time being a covering cherub in the garden of Eden, it is reasonable to conclude that this tree pictured the governing capacity of this covering cherub over man and the lower animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">When that covering cherub rebelled, becoming Satan the Devil, then his right to exercise dominion as God’s representative ended, it was cut down. The fact that the stump was left in the ground would show that God’s righteous rule would again be established over man. When? After “seven times” or seven years had passed over it. When did those seven years begin and how long are they? So long as God had his typical theocracy, the nation of Israel, there was a measure of sanity and divine rule over man, but when in 607 B.C. that nation was overthrown, then, in the fullest sense of the word, the government over mankind became beastly, ‘received the heart of a beast? This was foretold at Ezekiel 21:27: “I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” The coming of him whose right it is would then correspond to the end of Nebuchadnezzar’s madness, to the end of the seven times or years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">How long were these seven times or years? We have a key m Daniel’s prophecy previously mentioned Wherein seventy weeks turned out to be 490 years. Also to the Israelites who had rebelled in the wilderness and to the prophet Ezekiel God said that he had appointed a day for a year. (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6, 8) But how long are these years, how many days? From Genesis 7:11, 24; 8:3, 4 we learn that five months are exactly 150 days, thirty days to a month, thus giving us 360 days for a year according to Bible reckoning. Further, in Revelation 12:6 we have a time period of 1,260 days, which in verse 14 is also referred to as being ‘a period, periods [that is, two periods] and a half a period of time,’ or three and a half times. So our seven times or years would be seven times 360 days or twice 1,260 days for a total of 2,520 days, and since a day stood for a year, 2,520 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">During these seven times the nations of the world, beastly governments, would hold sway and therefore these are properly described as “the appointed times of the nations” during which Jerusalem would be trampled on. (Luke 21:24, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,)</span><span class="font25"> Since those nations began trampling Jerusalem underfoot in 607 B.C., then 2,520 years later, or A.D. 1914, would mark the coming of him whose right it is and the restoration of sane, divine dominion over mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">The Bible repeatedly associates the return of Christ and the establishment of the Kingdom. This is shown at Daniel 7:13,14, where with the clouds of heaven came one like the Son of man, to whom an everlasting dominion over all nations and peoples was given. Also, Christ Jesus likened himself to a nobleman who went to a far country to receive a kingdom and then to return. (Luke 19:12) Compare also Hebrews 10:13 with Psalm 2:6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">As we have seen in a previous issue of this magazine, Christ comes by turning his attention to the affairs of the earth; and from the foregoing we see that he did so at the end of the times of the nations, or seven times, which ran from 607 B.C. to A.D. 1914. Since all things should be established by the mouths of two or three witnesses, does the foregoing line of chronology find additional support in the Scriptures, verifying it as correct? It does. And we will consider this proof, which is particularly found at Matthew 24; Mark 13; Luke 21; 2 Timothy 3:1-6; Revelation 11:15-18, in the next succeeding issue of this magazine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Hawaii</span></p>
<p><span class="font36">H</span><span class="font25">AWAII, the paradise of the Pacific, is the land of make-believe come true. The beautiful azure skies unmarred by smoke and soot of industry give it the name “Blue Hawaii.” Although the islands are a vacation playground for the rich, yet by far the majority who enjoy her natural riches are the poor who live here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Hawaii is difficult to describe. Legend claims that Hawaii is the home of the rainbow. These rainbows appear daily due to the frequent showers that are blown into a fine mist by the gentle trade winds. The Hawaiians amusingly call it “liquid sunshine.” Then again, there are times when the mist changes into a downpour filling the streets, and it is not uncommon in downtown Honolulu to see the ladies take off their shoes, carry them gingerly across the street, and then put them on again on the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Hawaii is also known as a land of perpetual summer, a land of flowers and tropical trees. There is scarcely a time of the year when some tree is not in full bloom. The rainbow shower trees, poinciana trees, ja-coranda trees, tulip trees and the hau trees paint the landscape with their flowers the year round. Here natural beauty never seems to end. Even the humblest homes in the poorer sections have exquisite orchids hanging from the porches or gaily colored Crotons and Ti leaves to brighten the yards. No billboards or large signs are allowed in Hawaii to mar or hide the scenic beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Hawaiian hospitality is contagious; even the tourist absorbs some of it. The gaiety of meeting the planes and ships goes away back to the early days when a ship coming in was a very special occasion. Today Jehovah’s witnesses in Hawaii keep this pleasant custom of meeting their brothers from’ other lands. Some travel through Hawaii on their way to the missionary school of Gilead, others en route to an international convention, or heading out on their way to foreign assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">False Religion Mars Beauty</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">While there are no literal snakes in Hawaii, the old serpent called the Devil haft left his mark through his seed, false religion, crooked business and politics. Shipping strikes cause no end of suffering. Volcanoes that erupt bring anxiety and fear. A young lad watching a “live” volcano turned to his Dad and asked: “Father, is hell coming up in Hawaii?” What a vicious doctrine to instill in young minds, and what a crime to charge to a loving God! The people rejoice to learn that “there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” And that “the wages sin pays is death,” not eternal torment.—Ecclesiastes 9:10; Homans 6:23, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Jehovah’s witnesses in the course of their ministry from house to house in Hawaii have occasion to speak to many Buddhists. Buddhists, like so many professed Christians, know little about their religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">In spite of the many legends and superstitions, the Hawaiians have long been familiar with the name Jehovah, so it is not too difficult to prove to them that Jehovah is the one and only God, the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">(Psalm 83:18) The promise of perfect peace in a paradise earth appeals to these humble folk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Many Hawaiian families are heeding Jehovah's command to “Get out of her [false religion], my people?’ A bus driver delights in telling his fellow workers what he has learned from the study of the Bible. One day a stranger spoke up and said: “Driver. There is only one true church?’ “Is that so?” the driver asked. “Which is that?” The stranger in full voice replied: “Jehovah’s witnesses; they really study the Bible.” Imagine his surprise! When he asked the stranger if he was a witness, the man replied: “Well, not yet, but I’m studying?’ This bus driver's wife was very active in church work, but after two home Bible studies she stated that she could riot send her children back to the Catholic school after what the Bible had taught her. Both of them are talking to their relatives and friends, giving a wonderful witness from the Scriptures. They are now attending and participating in all the meetings, and he is enrolled in the theocratic ministry school. Both have asked to be immersed. All this occurred in four months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Our efforts at praising Jehovah truly have been blessed during the past service year. A new peak of 620 publishers was reached, and these conducted as many as 1,030 home Bible studies. Thus far during the year 81 have symbolized their dedication by water immersion. On hearing the good news, more and more of the Hawaiian people are discarding the by-and-by Hawaiian attitude, and the easy happy-go-lucky way of the islanders, to make their lives over for new-world living and active ministry, They are seeing the need of keeping close to God’s Word, the Bible, and following its good advice: ‘Do with your might what your hands.find to do? And to “ponder over these things, be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these thingSj for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you?’—Ecclesiastes 9:10; 1 Timothy 4:15,16, </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Heeding this good counsel, many more of the Lord’s other sheep will be found on these delightful islands of Hawaii,</span></p>

Malenkov announced 18/8) that Russia had the by-irogen bomb. His statement hat &quot;the United States has no -nonopoly in the production of Lhe hydrogen bomb&quot; came </span><span class="font22">as </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">no muprlse tu U. S, atomic sei-^ntlsLf, who well knew that there was no secret about the basic principles involved in </span><span class="font22">H-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">bomb manufacture. What surprised U.S. scientists was the apparent achievement of the goal in less than four years after the first atomic explosion in lhe Soviet Union. Still some leading U.S. aluxniu scientists were inclined to doubt Russia's claim, since nd evidence of unusual radioactivity had been reported in European air. Yet Russia produced the atomic bomb two years ahead of'estimates by U. S. experts; hence many observers believed Rus* sia had the H-bomb or was at the point of producing it. So the business of making the ultimate in weapons of total destruction grows, Even &quot;by December, 1951, the hydro genbomb business was Lhe third largest in the TU. S.I., exceeded only by that of the United States Steel Corporation </span><span class="font22">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">General Motors/’ (New York</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Strikn in France</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Postwar polities In France has been complicated enough, but the confusing situation took a turn for the worse in August when strikes in the railroads, communications, mines, public services and private industry began to cripple the economic life of the country The strike began whan union leaders opposed measures by l*remier Joseph Laniel to effect economies in the operation of the government La-bur leaders contended that the government's reform proposals were primarily directed against the working class, a big controversy being the deferment of the retirement age of employees of the government and nationalized industries. The strikes were so extraordinarily effective and widespread that noncommunist union leaders frankly conceded that they had lost control of lhe situation and that their orders were not effective. While the strikes raged. Premier Laniel told the country by radio (R/Ll) that the government would not yield to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">raiKEn unu uujuiw ^+*= country Mt to give the &quot;rest of the world the spectacle of a country that settles its quarrels in the street.&quot; Competent French observers believed that th^ strikes were a political move to force the resignation of the Conservative government-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">$ The Communists’ all-out offensive against the West’s food distribution program developed Into a fantastic, droll cycle in early August. Western officials distributed the free food pack* ages to East Germans, Then the CommunlBte confiscated them and presented the food to unemployed West Berliners । who, In some rases, brought them back to the original donors In West Beilin for redistribution to the East Germans. In spite of the Communists' attempt to thwart lhe food program, more than ten per cent of the East German population is believed to have token advantage of the free food offer. The West's use of food as a weapon had momentarily placed the Communists cm th? horns of a dilemma: To permit the giving away of food would be admitting that there are bad conditions in East Germany. To prevent food distribution might only stimulate the anticommunist feelings of East Germans. Meanwhile, Washington exulted over the Communists' predicament, officials saying that the U.S. had seised the offensive in the psychological war, and Is determined to keep it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">East-West Talks on Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; When the Communists replied W4) to a Wee rem bid for a foreign ministers’ conference on German unification, doubts appeared as to whether the proposed conference! would ever take place. Russia accepted the West's proposal for a foreign ministers' meeting in a manner viewed by the West as ambiguous. Regarding terms for Germany, in</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">cluding all-</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">German elections, called for in the Western note, Russia replied: &quot;One cannot expect anything from such proposals.'<sup>1 </sup>But the </span><span class="font22">Soviet Union did </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">pro</span><span class="font22">pose to discuss “measures to </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">decrease tension’* and “the problem </span><span class="font22">of re-establishment of </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">German </span><span class="font22">unity and the conclusion </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">of a peace </span><span class="font22">treaty/' Many </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Western </span><span class="font22">observers held that Russia had no intention of a </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">meeting, </span><span class="font22">that the “peace offensive'<sup>1</sup> had died.

Signed July 27, but kept secret until August 7, the declaration added that any breach of the Korean armistice would lead to consequences so grave that &quot;in all probability it would not be possible to confine hostilities within the frontiers of Korea.” To U, N. diplomats this warning to the Communists meant that the 16 nations would be ready to attack the Chinese mainland if there was a &quot;next time” in Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">90.93 Per Cent for Mossadegh &lt;$&gt; A big issue 4n Iran has been who will control the army. When the anti-Mossadegh riots took place, the army did nothing to protect the premier. This prompted Dr. Mossadegh to Introduce a bill to put the army under his control. But the bill was held up in the Majlis (lower and sole existing house of Parliament). There were also threats to test the premier on votes of confidence. When the shah, who alone has the constitutional </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">power to dissolve the Majlis, frowned xm dissolution, Dr. </span><span class="font22">Mossadegh </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">called for a plebiscite, or direct vote by the peo</span><span class="font22">ple on the question. The initial phase of the plebiscite brought 166,5^0 votes for dissolution, only 116 against it—or 99.93 per cent of the votes for Mossadegh. Shortly after the plebiscite Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi attempted to oust Premier Mossadegh, but failed and had to flee to Baghdad, Iraq (8/16). Three days later (8/199 Iranians loyal to the shah revolted, ousted Mossadegh, and hundreds died or were injured in the violent uprising led by the army. The shah returned to Iran.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; The Liberal government has governed Canada since 1935. This year opponents of the Liberals took a lesson from last year’s American presidential elections by maintaining, &quot;It's time for a change.” But when the voters went to the polls they thought otherwise: the Liberals won 171 seats in the House of Commons out of 265 while 71-year-old Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent won re-election.</span></p>

Then two days later another descent was made, again setting a record: 2,100 meters (6,888 feet). The old record, held by an American, was 4,500 feet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">The world’s top mathematical physicists thought the equations in Professor zEln-stein’s 1953 mathematical model of the universe were “next to impossible” of solution. But not Professor Vaclav Hlavaty of the Department of Mathematics at Indiana University, who declared (7/29): “It took two years of an upset stomach before I came upon the right solutions of Einstein's equation/' He said that the solutions of the equations reveal that electromagnetism is the basis of the universe, that it is possible to have gravitation without matter and for .space to exist without gravity and without matter. Professor Hlavaty believed that the solutions open the door to devising experiments for testing Einstein’s latest Unified Field Theory.</span></p>
