<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Knew His Prayer Would Be Rejected </span><span class="font3">(Proverbs 28:9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Knowing that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> is a “magazine of fact’’, I hesitate ’ to relate this experience lest it strain the faith of some of its readers in the truth of that statement. However, here it is as I saw and heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Invited by my sister to a chicken dinner, the minister was asked to return thanks. For sdme reason best known to himself, he said, “Now Myrtle, why spoil a perfectly good dinner<sup>1</sup>?” No thanks ■ were given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps he feared the supposedly divine power of other religionists might be his for a moment and a few words would “transubstantiate’’ his favorite chicken into ham and eggs. However, the real answer can be found by any reader who has not yet guessed it. J jet him,take his Bible and find Philippians 3: 19. For comparison he may look up Matthew 15:36 and then turn to Joshua 24:15 and “choose you this day whom ye will serve”.—Mrs. David Anthony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">China at the Vatican</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Chiang Kai-shek, Methodist .ruler of China, showed that he is in touch with what is going on in the world when in sending a minister to.the Vatican he chose a Catholic priest. It resembles the act of the Jews who raised $250,000 for the poor and gave half of it to the pope. They wanted io get the most possible for their money, in the tvay of protection and assistance, if any.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume XXV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.

<p><span class="font8">Whom Did Vichy Benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font5">NE way that the police have of catching rogues is like this: Suppose a bank has been robbed of, say a thousand five-dollar bills, and after a‘few weeks or months some person known to be a rogue is flush with five-dollar bills’. The detectives find out about it, and after a little time the big black wagon drives up for him and he has a chance to tell where he got them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It works the same way in the totalitarian racket. One way to spot the rogues is to see who has benefited by the crooked and inhuman practices inseparable from worship of the state. The principal beneficiary of the rump Vichy state is the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you see Hitler trying to shield anybody, you know right away that there is somebody that should be locked up. On one of their festive occasions the Nazis were about to shoot a batch of French hostages numbering 100. Suddenly the shootings were called off. The newspapers published the facts that the archbishop of Paris had telephoned the Vatican to use its influence to that end, and without a doubt he told Hitler to be a nice boy and not shoot this particular batch. But, to offset the break that had been made by the newspapers, Berlin was quick to tell the world that the Vatican had nothing to do with the reprieve. Many a burglar has gone to his death rather than squeal on his comrade. Many a drunk has helped to steady his fellow souse. So it’s touching to see Hitler shielding Pacelli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>z</sup> It will be remembered that the Vichy government was inaugurated </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in the dark, </span><span class="font5">that it was put in the hands of an aged man popularly described (even in Catholic periodicals) as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a fanatical Catholic, </span><span class="font5">' and that this man Petain on his assumption of office was lauded in the pope’s newspaper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano</span><span class="font5"> as the “good marshal”, the sum of all that is excellent and desirable, who is about to lead France down the primrose path to glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The “New Order&quot; in Vichy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hitler had not yet returned to Germany from his triumphal entry into Paris before the Vatican was showering . bouquets on everybody that had anything to do with the holdup. On June 9, 1940, (but not reported until July 11, because it wouldn’t look well) the headlines said “Pope Praised France in Speech to Envoy”; that is, she had done well in landing in the arms of her enemies as a result of her betrayal. He described France as</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">that land of France which we admired three years ago in the glittering dignify of its summer fecundity during our visit as Papal Legate to Lisieux, and which we see today reddened by the blood of its children and covered by unspeakable ruins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you have been fobbed and your house burned it makes you feel good when somebody rhapsodizes about your “glittering dignity” and “summer fecundity”. And then:—but you had better have this the way the news hounds wrote it up:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Pope went on to say that he felt his heart &quot;move to compassion before this extreme devastation and suffering” [caused by himself and Hitler], and implied that the outbreak of: war was due to the anti-Christian [by which he meant anti-Catholic, that is, republican, democratic] movements in public and private life. These movements,, he indicated, had “accelerated internal decomposition and aggravated external dissension between social classes, as well as nations”. The Pontiff then turned his thoughts to the war, which, he said, w’ill inevitably open &quot;'abysses of passion and hate”, and advocated the re-establishment after the war of a new Christian order [with himself at the eenter of the- whole show] in which [with the Roman Catholic, Hierarchy in charge of everything on the planet] “those ‘ fundamental principles of equity, moderation and charity, without which a true and lasting ■ peace cannot be conceived, should be loyally and integrally applied”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This speech doesn’t mean anything without the brackets, which were supplied so as to give the pope credit for this feeling of compassion which he says he has in his heart toward the French victim of the world holdup. When the pope says ho has one of these feelings of compassion you can know that he feels the weight of the spoons and silverware. It was thoughtful of the press associations to wait 32 days before giving this speech air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Six Days Went By</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Six days went by after all those words, and things began to happen. The Associated Press sent out a dispatch from Vichy that the Carthusian monks, makers of the world-famous Chartreuse booze, “are being allowed to return to their monastery high in the Alps at Fourvoirie after a 37-year exile from France.” Exiled'for the good of France, they were brought back for the good of the pope, so that he could have some of that compassion that the blurb was about earlier in the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Six more days went by and there was to be a “‘domestic moral purge’ of France by Marshal Petain’s new authoritarian regime”. All the old cabinet ministers that Petain could get his hands on were to be tried for ‘war responsibility<sup>5</sup>, but the old gentleman made the mistake of putting an honest Protestant judge on the bench, and so the trial had to be called off. Hence it was a little premature for the United Press to give the tipoff from Geneva that day which reads as follows, and makes interesting reading when one reads between the lines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Geneva, July 23 [1940] (UP)—A special correspondent of the newspaper </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font3"> said today in a dispatch from Lyon, France, that the Catholic Church was becoming influential in the reconstruction of the French nation. “The old quarrel between the church and the State now belongs to the past” [for the old lady is sitting straddle of the State’s neck], the correspondent wrote. “The Catholic clergy is directly associated with the effort of national reconstruction” [and they are telling old Mr. Petain just where to get on and where to get off]. Demonstrating the co-operation between the State and church, the correspondent said that on Bastille Day high military and civil authorities attended mass, contrary to precedent. The correspondent said that Cardinal Gerlier, Archbishop of Lyon, had given his approval of the reconstruction program of the Petain government [which was quite the decent thing to do, inasmuch as he probably wrote the program in the first place].</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Six more days went by and out came the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek,</span><span class="font5"> explaining:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Vatican’s official support was given to Marshal Henri Philippe Petain’s totalitarian government, on July 15 [because it was booked to garrote-'the French Republic], and the papal nuncio to France, Mgr. Valerio Valeri, was instructed to aid in the work of French reconstruction [and the robbing of the French hen roost]. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point there was a skip of only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font5"> days until the big headlines announced, “Vatican Lauds France for Disbanding Teachers.” This came right through fr'om Vatican City itself, dated August I,&quot;1940. Maybe even the teacher^ themselves, did not yet know that their ' organizatidn was booked to he broken up, but the Vatican knew it, and had decided it, so that was enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then there was a skip of a month. (It doesn’t look well to pull too many chickens off the roost at one time. '‘Morality” suggests that it is best to string things along a little.) On September 3, 1940, the French cabinet (on instructions from the archbishop, of course) “this evening repealed the 1904 law suppressing religious schools”. Why do you suppose “Catholic France” suppressed parochial schools'? They had a reason, else they would never have passed legislation that “teaching of every grade and every kind is forbidden in France to the Congregations”. You remember what the Franciscans “taught” (and practiced) in Germany, don’t you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a big row, but the teachers had to submit, and so, after three months more, the headlines (amid say, “Vichy Schools Again to Teach Concept of God [ the god of this world, the Devil]; Petain Regime Decrees Programs of Morality [A] in Classes Starting on January 1.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After a few days the archbishop of Reims went on the air and “appealed to the French people in the name of the 'church’ to remain true to the Vichy government”, telling them that it was “a crime against the church and therefore against God to oppose the true French government, the government that has the support of the 'church’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By January, 1941, the law was revoked forbidding public support of parochial schools, and the law' was also revoked forbidding the teaching of religion in the state’s educational institutions. Thus, in seven months from the time Hitler rode into Paris the Vatican had the whole educational system of France in the bag and the bag sewed up. The superb educational system ■which the French people had so patiently built up had been completely ruined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bishop of Marseilles, in a sermon, “advised . . . wholehearted co-operation with the Vichy government”,; so says </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The American Mercury.</span><span class="font5"> Well, why wouldn’t he? It’s his baby..It does ■what he w’ants it to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On March 6, 1941, less than nine months from the time Hitler entered Paris, an edict was issued from Vichy that “church” lands and properties restored to their rightful owmers, the common people, at the time of the separation of church and state, were once more to be turned over to the religious associations who, a generation ago, and for the good of the French people, had been ousted therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A year from the time Hitler came to Paris this wireless dispatch from Vichy appeared in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times;</span><span class="font5"> and it shows how everything was coming along just as Hitler and the pope had calculated that it wmuld come:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Vichy Aids Catholic Institute. Wireless to the New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Times. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vichy, France, June 20 [ 1041]—Under a law published here ^xlay the Association of Founders and Protectors of the Catholic Institute of Paris received the status of a philanthropic institution. Under.the preceding regime [of the French Republic] organizations with religious patronage had no legal standing. The Catholic Institute aids various scientific studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religion Rack in the Saddle</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is plain enough that France got rid of religion to a very great degree, and with good results to the people, but now the curse of mankind is back on the job, and will be until Armageddon puts an end to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What religion means to the common people, and what they get out of it, is pretty w<sup>T</sup>ell represented by an item in the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Times</span><span class="font5"> of August 21, 1942. It seems that at Haute Loire, which is in southern France, there is a statue of the virgin Mary w'hich is made of the metal of Russian guns brought from Sevastopol. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> drew attention to this, and then boasted that on a day last summer 20,000 people caipe there, barefoot, and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The devotions at the shrine were described as the most fervent to be yet seen in..the country. They centered around the statue of Our Lady, which was east from the metal of Russian guns brought from Sevastopol. Prayers for the well-being of France were offered up by the pilgrims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is plain as the nose on a man’s face what this act of religious idolatry is intended to accomplish. It seeks to grad. ually convey to the minds of the people <sup>4</sup> that they should do what they can, religiously, to illustrate that they are against Russia and therefore for the pope and , Hitler. In the first place, why would Mary want a statue made of Russian guns, and, in the second place, why would a London Catholic paper laud the event? The answer is in a U. S. Roman Catholic paper, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Register,</span><span class="font5"> issue of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">June 21, 1942, which covertly seeks to implant the same idea:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We support Russia, but not Communism. Our motives in aiding Russia are entirely practical. In this, we are as opportunist as Stalin himself, who is never anything but an opportunist. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The real legatee of the Vichy farce is the pope, and right well he and every member of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy know it. It is his objective to ruin every republic in the world and, when this is accomplished, by fair means or foul, to sit prettify in his saddle on the back of. the ‘beast that was, and is not, and shall again be present’, the League of Nations. See the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font5"> for particulars.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Priest* Kept Out of Sight</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">T Newport, R. L, Jacob 1. Tanner, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, called at 165 Park Holm, knocked, and received permission to enter. When he endeavored to bear witness to Jehovah’s kingdom, the lady of the house, Mrs. James Kelley,* said she was not interested and asked him to leave, which he did. Mrs. Kelley* talked it over with Mr. Kelley* and they summoned patrolman Franklin Joseph Sullivan*, who arrested Mr. Tanner. At the police station Captain Henry E. Madden* and Assistant Prosecutor John J. Shea’ fixed up a cast} against Tanner, maliciously charging him with breaking and entering. Frederick J. Murphy* was the prosecutor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witnesses against Tanner were William J. Donovan*, a housing official, and Francis Edward Carroll*, a near-by resident. The case came before Jud^e Alberie A. Archambault*, and he directed a verdict of acquittal. He probably thought that the priest* who kept out of sight through the whole farce had overdone it. The conclusion of the story, as it appeared in the Newport </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News, </span><span class="font5">March 12, 1942, was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When he took the stand, Mr. Tanner said he lived here with his wife at 5 Green Acres. He testified he is a minister of the Lord and outlined his creed, citing the example of Jesus to go from house to house. The court cheeked the witness at this point, saying, “And you can be thrown out of houses too,” and adjourned until 1: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Poltergeist in Seattle</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ A poltergeist broke out in the home of Henry Hutchinson, Seattle, Wash. With detectives' and firemen swarming all over the place four fires were set in the house, food was spilled all over the place, a garden was destroyed, a rope swing was cut several times, garden hose was slashed, a pan .of dishwater was spilled, potted plants were upset, the walls and a picture and crucifix were smeared with butter, etc. It is the malicious work of demons, and can be explained in no other way. It may be that one of the family is obsessed without being aware of it. But no blame would attach to such a victim of the demons unless he submitted to them by choice;</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Ecuador, at the Top of the World</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE circumference'' of the earth is greater at the equator than at any other point, and so, if all the earth were smooth as glass, Ecuador, which takes its name from the earth’s equator, would be on the great circle that is farther away from earth’s center than any other circle that can be drawn on the planet, and so would be one of the world’s high* est lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it is one of the highest lands in another important respect. There are places in the world where some mountains, a few, have higher peaks than are to be found in.Ecuador. Here, however, are more very high peaks within a limited area than are to be found elsewhere. One of these, Pichincha, is right on the equator. The highest of its five peaks is 15,918 feet above the sea; its crater is nearly a mile across and is 2,500 feet deep, making’it one of the deepest in the world. It lies a little northwest of the city of Quito, the capital of Ecuador, and in one of its eruptions, in the year 1660, it quite destroyed that interesting and beautiful city, which today is Ecuador’s metropolis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest volcano near Quito, however, is not Pichincha, to the northwest of the city, but the great Cotopaxi, 35 miles south-southeast, remarkable as the loftiest active volcano in the world. With a height of 19,613 feet, it has a crater 1,200 feet deep, with a diameter east to west of 1,650 feet and north to south of 2,300 feet. It is one of the most beautiful masses in the world, rivaling the celebrated Fujiyama of Japan in its symmetry of outline, but overtopping it by -more than 7,000 feet. Its upper portion is an almost perfect cone 4,400 feet in height. It is more than 15,000 feet higher than Vesuvius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scientific explanation of volcanic eruptions is that a volcano is a great pot into which, from time to time, water seeps. When enough water gets inside, and gets hot enough to get up steam,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">there is eventually an explosion, or a succession of them. Cotopaxi had a series of these explosions in 1744. At that time its thunderings were clearly heard at Honda, Colombia, 600 miles away on the Rio Magdalena. At another time, in 1885, when eruptions occurred, the sound at Guayaquil, Ecuador, 156 miles distant in a straight line, was like the incessant discharge of heavy artillery, shaking the earth and causing the doors and windows to rattle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two highest mountains in the United States are Mount Whitney, California, 14,495 feet, and Mount Elbert, Colorado, 14,419 feet, but Ecuador has Chimborazo (21,424), Cotopaxi (19,613), Ca-yambe (19,534), Antisana (19,260), and thirteen other peaks, Altar, Carahuaira-zo, Corazon, Cotocachi, Iliniza, Imba-hura, Mojanda, Pichincha, Quilindana, Sangay, Saraurcu, Tunguragua, and Ya-naurcu, each of which is higher than any peak in the whole United States. The lowest pass through the Andes, in Ecuador, or anywhere in the system, is 6,888 feet, on the Peruvian border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A word regarding two of the mountain peaks above mentioned: Iliniza, 20 miles south-southeast of Quito, has two peaks, is covered with perpetual snow and is usually cloud-capped. Antisana has on its slopes, at 13,000 feet above sea level, one of the highest settlements in the world, the village of Tambo de Antisana (Inn of Antisana).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Scene of Many Storms</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mountains are proverbially places of storms, and Ecuador has been a place of many storms, political ones. To start with, the Quitu Indians were peaceable folks. The Incas wahted to extend their dominions, and so, before the Spaniards came, they invaded the land and took over the administration of things. And, as a matter of fact, the Inca Atahualpa (the one that Pizarro had garroted on the advice of the “Most Reverend” &quot;Valverde, bishop of Lima) was horn of a Quitu mother. The very same year in which Pizarro had Atahualpa butchered, he had one of his lieutenants, Sebastian de Benalcazar, seize what is now Ecuador, and that gentleman, on August J 5, 1534, founded Quito as an evidence of the formal possession of the country by Pizarro. The Indians were mostly peaceful and made little effort to prevent the seizure of their lands. They were not bloodthirsty thieves and murderers like Pizarro and the “Most Reverend<sup>1</sup>’ Valverde, who later became their bishop, and, for all practical purposes, their real ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The viceroys of New Spain were all Roman Catholics, all subjects of the king of Spain, and, like their king, they took their orders from those that they considered their ecclesiastical' directors. This was especially true of Ecuador, and it could be truthfully said that for 274 years after Benalcazar seized the country it was governed according to the wishes of the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So the “church” governed with a high hand. Gonzalez Suarez states that by the end of the seventeenth century there were in Ecuador alone 42 convents, with the one city of Quito having in it about 1,000 priests. Suarez stated for the benefit of posterity that “great damage was caused to the moral advancement of the people by the bad example not only in lack of virtue among the priests, but by their lack of good manners”. This is referred to those Roman Catholic bishops of the United States of America who so recently got all steamed up that anybody should teach “religion” in South America except themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Opening the Windows Northward</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Experience has shown that when the air in a room gets too foul, it is a good thing to open the windows. Even the Hierarchy seems to have learned that much, and so, in 1717, it shifted the governmental control of Ecuador from the episcopate of Peru to that of Neuva Granada, as the United States of Colombia was at that time called. This was a good thing for the Ecuadorians. There was some shifting back and forth, but freedom was on the way, and on the battlefield of Pichincha, May 29, 1822, the power of the viceroy was overthrown and Ecuador gained its independence. At first the new state was called “Estado del Ecuador en Colombia”. <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The republic had a stormy path ahead, consisting mostly of dictators, some of them bad and some of them worse, but with the people always trying to gain liberty and the “church” always trying to keep their noses on the grindstone, so that when they got to “Purgatory” they could look back and think what nice times they had while they- were on the way to the frying pan. The way the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font5"> puts it is like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The persistent factionalism, and armed strife that marked Ecuador’s history was due primarily to the division of the ruling class into two political parties, Conservatives and Liberals, with diametrically opposed principles and programs. The Conservatives as a rule staunchly upheld the time-honored prerogatives of the Roman Catholic Church and the army. They fought virtually every step toward liberalism in both the political and economic fields. The Liberals, on the other hand, generally sought to curb the powers of the Church and the clergy, to secularize education, and extend personal and civil liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Gains, Little by Little</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Little by little the people made some gains. In 1889 the giving of tithes to the “church” loafers (10 percent of the farm produce) was abandoned. In 1902 civil marriage; first was authorized. In 1904 the “church” was placed under state control, the foundation of new religious orders was forbidden and new religious communities were denied entrance. ETom that time forth all members of the episcopacy had to be Ecuadorians. The state took over the landed property of the religious orders, putting the ejected friars on a pension. It was explained at the time</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">when'this was done that the &quot;church” had become too wealthy, the wealth having come through legacies and by labor which received no “earthly” pay. In May, 1937, the dictator then in power forbade the vote to priests and certain others that he adjudged incapable of voting honestly or independently. Now there is ' complete freedom of worship and the press, and there are even Protestant missionaries, at Macas and Tena, two towns far inland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president is elected directly by the people, to serve a four-year term. The Congress consists of two houses, the senate and the chamber of deputies; the senators are elected for four years, the deputies for two. All literate men and women over 21 years of age may vote. The president cannot succeed himself. The supreme court consists of five justices and the minister fiscal. The local administrators, from the governors of the provinces down to the lieutenants of . the parishes, are all appointed by the president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Educational Conditions Improving</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Education has had a hard time in Ecuador until very recently, the Indians - having been virtually deprived of it altogether. Now the 'Ministry of Public Instruction exercises supervision over all educational institutions whatsoever. There are universities at Quito, Cuenca, Guayaquil, and Loja. There are two normal schools in Quito, one in Cuenca, and one in Guayaquil, and short elementary normal courses in seven cities. In 1942 there were 3,108 elementary schools, with 221,030 enrollment, and 36 secondary schools, with 8,323. The government imposes a fine upon landowners for each illiterate person over 21 years of age working on the property, and those fines are reimposed every two years. Primary instruction is gratuitous and obligatory for children between 6 and 12 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The colleges of Ecuador areuow paying close attention to courses in English. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">' FEBRUARY 2, 1944</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of their spokesmen, Dr, Julian Lara, of the University of Guayas in Guayaquil, draws attention to the fact that four times as many Ecuadorians attend American schools as is the case in reverse, and he thinks many young Americans could profitably finish their courses in his land, where they can do so with less expense than here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An eight-hour labor law and a model child-labor law were put in effect January 1,1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ecuador has broken relations with the Axis powers, and permitted the United States to occupy bases on the Santa Elena peninsula, westernmost area in Ecuador, and also on the Galapagos islands, 650 miles due west of Ecuador, to which country they belong. The Galapagos are the home of the great tortoises, which reach a length of four feet, get to weigh four hundred pounds and live for four centuries, making them the oldest living animals on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Quito, the Capital</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quito, the capital of Ecuador, 9,371 feet above sea level, and only fifteen miles south of the equator, is one of the highest capitals in the world. There are no stoves, stovepipes or chimneys in Quito, for fear of earthquakes. The cooking is done in pots and kettles over a charcoal fire. As there is almost no variation in the climate, it is one of the best places in the world for the cure of tuberculosis. In the days when men wore hats (before the days of the automobile) the best Panama hats were made here. Quito laces are also famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jesuit church at Quito is almost lined with gold leaf. The Franciscan church of the same city is also reipark-able for the amount of gold used in decorating its interior. The intent of these exhibitions of wealth is to frighten and bulldoze the poor into submission and subjection. The same city, according to one of W. R. Hearst’s publications, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The American Weekly,</span><span class="font5"> also contains,, op Venezuela street, a courtyard &quot;paved</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 </span><span class="font5">with human hones” of those Indians who “faced death by torture rather than accept the imposed ‘Christianity<sup>1</sup> of the Spanish”, of the Valverde-Pizarro stripe. After explaining that the methods of conversion included “all the old paininflicting methods of the Spanish Inquisition, such as the rack, the wheel, and pulling a man in half with horses”, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weekly</span><span class="font5"> says that “the bone-paved courtyard ultimately accomplished its cruel purpose; for the Indian population soon , fell into line on Christianity”. It should be explained that the bishops who of late objected so strenuously to teaching in South America anything except the Roman Catholic religion are really beefing with sorrow because they cannot put the old system back into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quito now has a population of about 150,000. For centuries it had neither railway nor highway connecting it with the coast. A part of the 165-mile trip to Guayaquil was made on muleback, on the breast of Mount Chimborazo at a height of 14,000 feet. But since 1908 it has had the Guayaquil-Quito railway, one of the greatest engineering feats in the world. At Nariz del Diablo (Devil’s Nose) a forbidding mountain intercepts the railway, and the train ascends 2,900 feet in five minutes, along a daring zigzag route cut out of solid rock along the mountainside and supported by huge retaining walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is now possible, at any season of the year, to drive from Quito to either Caracas or Buenos Aires, and in the dry season to go all the way down to Punta Arenas, at the lower tip end. of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Guayaquil and Other Cities</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Guayaquil, population 180,000, has rail communication with Quito, 280 miles away (by railway). The Gulf of Guayaquil, with a mouth 140 miles wide, is the largest gulf on the west coast of South America. The city is 33 miles up the Guayas river. Though as yet its docks have accommodations only for vessels of 18 feet draught, vessels of 22 feet enter the harbor. Smaller ships go regularly 80 miles above the city. In 1935 a total of 739 steam and motor vessels entered the Gulf of Guayaquil; in 1938 a total of 473 vessels entered Guayaquil port itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The city was founded by Sebastian Benalcazar, July 25, 1535, a little less than a year after he founded Quito. The upper floors in business districts project oyer the walks, forming arcades. Malarial and bilious fevers (the latter-called Guayaquil fever) are common. The shipments from the port are cocoa, coffee, vegetable ivory, rubber, hides, and gold and silver. The industrial establishments are sawmills, foundries, machine shops, ice factories, and a large brewery. Before the war it was regularly visited by steamers of nine European lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ibarra, 10,000 population, 7,340 feet above sea level, 50 miles north of Quito, has a mild, humid climate and is set in the midst of gardens and orchards. It has manufactures of cotton and woolen fabrics, hats, sandals, sacks, ropes, laces, sugar, distilled spirits, and cordials. Destroyed by earthquake in 1868; rebuilt,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Latacunga, 18,500 population, 9,120 feet above sea level, 56 miles south of Quito, was discovered by the Spaniards in 1534. It is one of the oldest towns in Ecuador, but, on account of being only 25 miles from the great volcano Cotopaxi, has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes. There are manufactures of woolens and cottons, and potteries. Pumice stone and saltpeter are worked. It is often quite cold and unpleasant on account of winds blowing from the hear-by snow-clad heights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ambatd, 17,674 population, 80 miles south of Quito by the highway, 8,606 feet above sea level, and near the northern foot of Chimborazo, has an equable climate. The town has a flourishing trade in grain, sugar and cochineal and is known throughout Ecuador for its manufacture of boots and shoes and cordage made from cabuya. It was once destroyed by an eruption from Cotopaxi (1698) and has been badly damaged by earthquakes on several occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Riobamba, 22,427 population, 9,039 feet above sea level, is located on the river Pastaza, about 100 miles south of Quito, on the railway to Guayaquil. It is used as an overnight stop by travelers making the rail trip to Quito. The population is mostly Indian. On Saturday, which is market day, the three plazas of the city are busy places. Rugs, hand-tooled leather articles, ponchos, embroidered belts, roped sandals and baked guinea pigs (instead of hot dogs) are among the things offered to purchasers. Some of the Indians who live here occasionally go down to the Amazon, which is 450 miles away. They have a tough time of it until they get to Andoas, which is about halfway down the Pastaza to the point where it flows into the Amazon. And they 'have a harder time getting back. It is no fun poling a canoe up stream at the rate of a mile and a half an hour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cuenca, 45,000 population, 8,640 feet above sea level, third-largest city in Ecuador, is the Athens of the state, founded in 1557. It is the center of fertile regions producing grain, cotton, sugar, and cochineal. Rich metal deposits are worked in the neighborhood. Manufactures are pottery, hats, and woolens. There is a considerable trade in fruits, cheese, and grain. Peruvian bark (cinchona, source of quinine) is exported. Communication with the coast is difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Loja, 10,000 population, 7,000 feet above sea level, founded in 1546, is a center for stock-raising, cereals, sugar, tobacco, and cotton. Gold and silver are mined in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some of the Treasures .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the plant treasures of Ecuador is cocoa, of which it once-produced a half of the world’s supply. The “witchbroom” disease has markedly reduced this crop, but it is still very important as a source of export wealth/Other important agricultural products are coffee, of which 30,000,000 pounds are raised for export, sugar, tobacco, cotton, corn, rice, oranges, lemons, rubber, tagua nuts (vegetable ivory for making button^), annatto seed (for coloring butter, cheese and varnish), kapok (for stuffing pillows), mangrove .bark (for tanning purposes), carludovica palmata (used in making “Panama” hats, and so called because they went to market through the Panama canal region), and balsa-tree wood, or “corkwood”, as it is more often called. More than one hundred kinds of useful woods have been described. There are 10,000 square miles of virgin forests on the Pacific slope, and another 80,000 square miles on the eastern slope of the Andes. There are about 100 species of fruits and 30 species of cacti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The country is rich in gold ($2,000,000 worth in 1939), petroleum (on the Peruvian border; 2,313,000 barrels in 1939), silver, copper, coal, lead, zinc, and sulphur, most of which remains undeveloped. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of its exceptional abundance of bird life (about 1,500 species having been found) and because 147 kinds of hummingbirds have been found, Ecuador is sometimes called “the land of hummingbirds”. Sixty-six species of Ecuador birds visit the United States every summer, but, like other aristocrats, they head for the south when winter comes. And speaking of birds, of the 8,000 species of beetles in Ecuador one attains, a length of five inches; and if that isn’t a • “bird”, what is it? If you had one of those five-inch boys running around on the back of your neck, the chances are that you would ask some kind friend to remove that “bird” from your person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are some, not many, llama and alpaca. Horses, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs are now raised everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Human Treasures</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are human treasures in Ecuador’s 2,921,688 population. Only the Creator knows where they are, but nothing can prevent His hand from finding</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">them. It is estimated that 8 percent of the population are pure white, 27 percent pure Indian, 54 percent mestizos, 6 ^percent mulattoes, and 3 percent are Asiatics. There has been less new blood brought into Ecuador than into any other country of South America. Of every . 1,000 births 345 are illegitimate. Young people insist on raising families whether they can afford to hire a priest or not. Such is life. At this point, because it is of interest, there is inserted a table showing the acknowledged illegitimate births per 1,000 births for the years 1921-1925 for each of the countries named. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font5"> from which ' the figures are taken, maintains that in several of the states of the United States there is no acknowledgment of the number born out of wedlock, and so the figures ought rightly to be increased.

<p><span class="font5">There is still in the atmosphere in , Ecuador a considerable measure of the “master and slave” idea, though it is diminishing. Ernie Pyle, the columnist, recently visited the country, and in his story in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World-T elegram </span><span class="font5">he makes this impressive statement about what he witnessed as respects human industry:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Men, women and children are all beasts of burden. They tote loads that I could not even lift, let alone carry. They lean far over, the load rests on their back, and is held by a strap running over the tops of their heads. They go along at almost a half trot.....In our whole</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">175-mile trip over the Quito plateau [by auto from Cajabamba to Quito] I do not remember seeing a single Indian resting from his load. The most noticeable thing about these Indians is their ruddy cheeks, which almost look rouged. That comes, I suppose, from the high altitude and sharp wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">River and Border Perplexities</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ecuador has always had river and border perplexities. The Amazon region east of the Andes, and for that reason called the “Oriente”, has plenty of large rivers all flowing into the Amazon, but the best and navigable portions of all../ those streams are controlled by Peru, and the two governments can never agree as to where one administration leaves off and the other begins. The Bio Morona, 340 miles in length, is navigable upstream for 310 miles by steam launches drawing four feet of water. Its width is from 260 to 490 feet; and its depth, from 40 to 60 feet. The Rio Napo, 700 miles long, a mile wide at its mouth, is navigable by steam launches 464 miles, to a point some distance above where the Rio Coca enters into it. At the point where navigation ceases, though the river is shallow it is 1,500 feet wide. Beyond that point comes the poling by canoe. Ecuador would like a little more use of the Amazon tributaries. In the past 125 years there have been any number of settlements, arranged by the friendly intervention of American, presidents and other rulers, but after a settlement is effected it is only a year or so before the old perplexities arise in another locality and with a new personnel. So Ecuador never knows where its boundaries are, and maps of it, as respects its “Oriente”, Hre to some degree guesswork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One thing in the “Oriente”, however, that is not guesswork, is the tribe of Indians variously called Jivaro, Jibaro or Shuaro. They have some odd customs. When a child is born the mother scours, the woods in search of delicacies, while the fathe^lies in bed for a week, receiving the neighbors and their eongratula-tlons. He works himself up into a state (helped on by the demons) where he suffers pain and fatigue until his wife returns with the delicacies he craves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jivaros (they have their own language and will have nothing to do with missionaries) have another funny one. If one offends them, or if they covet his head, they remove it, and by a skillful process of removal of the bones of which it is composed, and by the use of chemicals of which they understand the use, they shrink the head down to about the size of a baseball. An exploration expedition missed an Englishman from their party but subsequently came across a group of children playing with his head, with all the features intact. He must have offended somebody. It does not seem like a nice habit. Still, look at the ridiculous teachings of “Purgatory” and “eternal torture”, with a three-headed god, and a woman at the head of the whole works, receiving most of the prayers, and you have something just as objectionable, even though it takes a different form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ecuador is a very interesting country.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Advertising Demonism</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T IS against the law of Almighty God to advertise demonism. This can be seen in numerous instances in the Scriptures. There was a case in the island of Cyprus where Simon Magus sought to draw attention to himself and thus away from the gospel as preached by Paul. Paul said to him, “O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season.” The occasion for these remarks is the seeing in the Tulsa (Okla.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily World </span><span class="font5">of an advertisement of a man whose name is withheld, but who refers to his activities in behalf of demonism as “The Voice of Two Worlds” and the Institute of Mentalphysics, and who, in his advertisement, says, “Man can now use the power of 1,000 minds.” The minds that would thus be used are the. minds of demons, devils, which no man should use if he would preserve his sanity.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“Free Nation’s” Assembly in the British Isles</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HOUGH the threat of.Nafii hordes overrunning Britain no longer hangs like a pall over that island fortress, the land is not free from totalitarian dangers. On the home front the “four freedoms” of the Atlantic Charter have mot been solidly adhered to. Government actions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">toward Jehovah’s witnesses serve as straws in the wind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In September, 1942, ten British cities united with more than <sub>(</sub>75 other cities throughout the earth in h Christian' assembly, the New World&quot; Theocratic Assembly. Two of the British cities,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">however, were unable to participate; the assemblies were banned by the home sec-.retary, Herbert Morrison (whose recent action of springing England’s foremost Fascist, Mosley, from a British prison has aroused public.outcry). Two months later a government order ' was passed prohibiting the Christian ; magazines, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conso</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lation.</span><span class="font5"> More encroachments on the home front against inherent rights held to be inviolable from time immemorial, and particularly since the signing of the Magna Charta, which document against tyrannous oppression was at its birth declared null and void by a papal bull. ■ This move circumventing free worship and speech and assembly, and hence reducing the Atlantic Charter to mere wordage, was doubtless effected by Catholic Action, still the deadly foe of freedom today, as in days of yore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But were the people of God and their activities crushed by these home-front encroachments ? The report of the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, held August 27-29, 1943, answers No! The Free Nation increases there, as elsewhere. At the New World Assembly in 1942 1.1,000 attended; the “Free Nation’s” Assembly drew 17,500, in 15 cities. Immersed were 654 persons, signifying their consecration to serve Jehovah as His witnesses. So the enemies of true freedom cannot stem the advance of God’s lighters for freedom in a new world, Jehovah’s new world.—Romans 8:28; 2 Corinthians 13:8; Philippians 1:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">times meet with seeming success. Such was the ease in this latest assembly. The speech scheduled for the public meeting was “Freedom in the New World<sup>5</sup>'. There are men of influence in Britain who oppose a new, free world; their desires incline toward a totalitarian order modeled after the Boman Catholic Hier-1 archy pattern. Their wishes overrode the Atlantic Charter theorizings, and the Bible lecture “Freedom in the New World” could not be given, due to religious censorship. “Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front,” much needed in Britain, as elsewhere, was substituted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pictures accompanying This brief article show the zealous activity of the witnesses in Britain in advertising The Theocracy, and also some of the halls used during the “Free Nation's” Assembly. One experience in connection with halls is interesting. In Manchester, one of the cities where the convention was banned in 1942, no hall was available. Finally, in a small town on the outskirts of Manchester a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon hall was secured. These halls were. built by non-conformists with a view to giving pleasant (religious) Sunday afternoons. The hall committee was approached by troublesome ones and told their hall would suffer damage, but the committee opposed religious intolerance and stood by their contract. The committee attended the public lecture, enjoyed it, and expressed surprise to see over a thousand in the hall, more than had been in it for many a year. When negotiations were first made its use was doubtful, as it was customarily engaged on Sunday afternoons. It was pointed out by Jehovah’s witnesses that no better program could he obtained than the scheduled Bible lecture. As a result over a hundred of the members of the religious brotherhood attended the public lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly was a blessing to Christians in Britain. Opposition to such Bible meetings should serve as a warning signal to the populace generally, which, if heeded, would work to the welfare of the nation.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark13"></a>TayWORD is </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Truth”</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">John 17:17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Some Will Go to Heaven</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">M</span><span class="font5">AN was created to stay on earth forever. The reason why a relatively small company of humans will go to heaven is that they go through the following dealings with the God of heaven as outlined in the Sacred Scriptures, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a man (or woman) makes a full consecration to God and is justified in God’s sight through the merits of the sacrifice of the Son of God, Christ Jesus, then such consecrated one undergoes a change. What happens to him according to the Bible is that he is begotten by the spirit of God to become a “new creature”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Begetting</span><span class="font5"> means the beginning. The begetting of the new creature, then,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">means the beginning of a newness of life for the consecrated one, as described at 2 Corinthians 5:17. &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When he was justified 'by Jehovah God there resulted to him the right to live as a human creature on earth for ever, and this is what is sacrificed according to his agreement to do God’s will. At such time Jehovah begets him to a hope of life in the heavens, and thus he is called to a “high calling”, a &quot;heavenly calling”, as it is stated at Philippians 3:14 and Hebrews 3:1. This begetting is in the nature of a contract or an agreement. Another word used for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">contract</span><span class="font5"> is “covenant”. In order to make a contract there must be two or more parties thereto, and there must be a consideration passing from one to the other. Where there are mutual promises, made on both sides, this is sufficient consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Suppose now we name the one making the consecration to God and receiving justification Honest Heart.Honest Heart presents himself to the Lord Jesus, God’s high priest, fully surrendering himself and agreeing to do God’s will. There is the promise on his part, then, and he is one party to the contract through the “Advocate with the Father”, namely, Christ Jesus, And when Christ Jesus, the High Priest, presents him to the Father, the Lord God Jehovah says, in substance: “Honest Heart, in view of the fact that you have turned away from the wrongful course, and have come to Jesus and have made a full surrender of yourself in consecration, thereby exercising faith in His blood shed for you and also exercising faith in my purpose; and in consideration of the further fact that my beloved Son has imputed to you His merit to make you acceptable before me, I accept you and determine that you are right and are justified. Accepting you as fit for sacrifice with Him, I give to you my exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might become partaker of the divine nature.” --2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19440202_files/g_E_19440202-5.png" alt="" style="width:459pt;height:251pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">This is in harmony with the apostle James’ statement: “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” (James 1:18) That'this be. getting involves sacrifice the prophetic scripture, at Psalm 50:5, shows, saying: “Gather my saints together unto me; those who have made a covenant [contract] with me by sacrifice.” Honest Heart being now begotten has the promise of life in heaven. He is begotten to a new hope of life. The apostle Peter writes: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith tinto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.” (1 Peter 1: 3-5) The inheritance to which Honest Heart is now begotten is an incorruptible inheritance, which is the “divine nature^’. This means that if he is faithful unto deatli, faithful to his part of the contract, he is certain to be born in the resurrection to heavenly life by the power of the Divine One, Jehovah God, who is always faithful to His part of the contract. So Jesus says: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”—Revelation 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Anyone thus presented by Jesus to the Father and then justified, accepted and begotten, is designated in the Scriptures as a new creature. “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature : old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17) There is now a newness of life, whicfi does not result from being transferred to another climate, but from being given a new dominating factor in our lives, namely, the will of God as expressed in His Word. Honest Heart, or whoever takes this step, now has new hopes, new aims, new aspirations, and new thoughts. He is not looking for earthly honor and glory; but he is looking forward to the time when he might be for ever with the Lord in the heavenly Kingdom, serving God in perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such one is now dead from the standpoint of a human creature. The apostle Paul puts it this way: “Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.” (Colossians 3: 3) The new creature now must be renewed, refreshed and invigorated and strengthened by knowledge; but not by ordinary knowledge. It is by an acquaintance with God’s will and a deep appreciation of His purpose. (Colossians 1:9) The worldly cannot know anything about this; only those who are in the relationship with the Lord. Th'e whole, world lies in the wicked one, says 1 John 5:19. Now the new creature in Christ is admonished to be not conformed to this world, but to 'be transformed by the renewing of his mind, that he might prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. —Romans 12: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The one begotten is begotten by the spirit of God, the holy invisible force of God. Thereafter he is anointed. This anointing is received by reason of his coining into the body of Christ. He is baptized into Christ's death; therefore he is baptized into Christ’s body, to be a member of His church. To be baptized means to be immersed. To be baptized into Christ’s death means to be immersed into the death of Christ. &quot;Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6: 3, 4) Baptism in water, in the case of such a one, is merely a symbol of his having made a consecration to God. It would be of no meaning at all for one to be baptized in water unless he had first undergone the real baptism of consecration of himself to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of those thus begotten of God’s spirit and inducted into the ‘&quot;body of Christ” receive the anointing of the spirit of God through the Head of the body, which is Christ Jesus. Jesus, at the time He symbolized His consecration to God by being baptized in Jordan’s waters, was begotten of God’s spirit and anointed of the holy spirit without measure. (Matthew 3:16,17) Three and a half years later, on the day of Bente-cost after His death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven, His faithful disciples also received the anointing of the holy spirit. Thereafter, down till the completion of the membership of the “Jjody” or church of Christ Jesus, all those consecrating and being begotten and taken into Christ’s body receive such anointing of the spirit through Christ Jesus their Head.</span></p>

It is quite religious. One side is printed, for general use in all congregational churches; the other side is mimeographed, for the use of any local church that wants the service. The sample at , hand is interesting. On the printed side is a warning:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Day by day paganism increases, morality weakens, and Christian experience lessens. We are worried about democracy! We are distraught when we think about the collapse of the things we hold dear. . . . Thus we fit perfectly into a Protestantism decadent and feeble. What a tragedy it is that this Protestantism whieh stands for liberty of thought and freedom of worship is so lightly regarded. This free House of God, known as Protestantism, fought for through tears and blood, no longer remains the happy rendezvous of an enthusiastic and dedicated people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5"> HAD been warned before arriving at my territory that it had been a mobviolence territory, and that 1 might be molested. There had been quite a big mob, so I had heard, and they had burned some of our Bible literature on the street. The chief mobster, however, had met his doom shortly after, when a boat in which he was a passenger capsized and he was drowned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first time I was to go in the magazine street work I prepared myself beforehand by studying, and also took </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Servants Defended</span><span class="font5"> with me. I was engaged in a Scriptural conversation with a couple in a car, and the man was quite interested, and was asking questions, and was turning the pages of the magazine which he had in his hand when a cop walked up and said, “There is an ordinance in this town against that work, isn’t there?” This was the opening sentence in a dialogue which ran as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I wouldn’t know, as I am a stranger here, but I should think that no town would have an ordinance against what Almighty God commands to be done, and in the event that there is such an ordinance, I must obey God rather than man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Well, I think there is an ordinance against that work, and for the present you had better discontinue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have some information here for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I don’t want it! I don’t want it! You had better discontinue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I cannot do so upon your request, I have the Supreme Court decisions on this work and my constitutional and Bible rights to do this work, and—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I' am not interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you don’t want to read this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Jehovah’s Servants Defended),</span><span class="font3"> especially this portion about officers’ being liable in damages for depriving one of his freedom, I will read it for you, as it is information you need very much in your position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cop turned on his heel and walked away, and, as I was going in that direction also, I accompanied him, much to his disliking, and we left the man and woman in the car, both of them laughing heartily at something that seemed to them quite comical. You can probably guess what it was. I read only the first two paragraphs to the cop. He did not choose to hear the rest. Now he gives me a wide berth whenever he sees me, and I have never since been able to get within talking distance of him. However, both of his parents are very much interested, and are on my back-call list. -—Naomi Burns, Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Patrick and Michael “Do Their Duty” </span><span class="font5">♦ It is an “unforgivable sin” for Roman Catholics to permit their children to be educated in the public schools, unless they fix it up with the bishop. You see, they might imbibe ideas of freedom of worship and other fundamentals of Anierican citizenship that are contrary to Vatican “morals”. It might even be that one of the teachers might love God on her own hook instead of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">around via </span><span class="font5">the priest; and think what an example that would be to the children! So it was in the interest of the Vatican that the Boston school board solemnly removed from the ranks of public schoolteachers Doris K. Scary, first grade teacher </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">the Beethoven School,' West Roxbury, when they found she is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Patrick J. Foley said the eyes of the whole city were watching the case; so they must </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font5"> ahead .with their dirty work whether or no. He didn’t say that the priest had told him that they must do it. Also, Michael J. Ward, of the same board, said that no one was objecting to Miss Seary’s belief. Oh, certainly not! She could believe what she pleased provided nobody found out what it was. Patrick and Michael lived up to the highest and noblest Vatican standards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Wellston unit of Jehovah’s witnesses at St. Louis met at an attractive Kingdom Hall in the suburbs. The large plate-glass windows offered excellent opportunity for a display of Bible literature. Bible literature is never appreciated by religious totalitarians. Hence they take occasion to get hoodlums to do their dirty work when opportunity offers. The large plateglass windows were broken by these ignorant tools of behind-the-scenes bead-manipulators. The thing . was quite transparent to Jehovah’s witnesses, who are not easily deceived. The owners of thebuild-ing, however, were troubled, and finally asked Jehovah’s witnesses to move out.</span></p>

Many of the streetcars would slow up so the motormen could get a better look, and, as a result, all the passengers also had a look. Not bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the day the fixtures were moved out to the new hall many of the people in the neighborhood came to tell the witnesses what they thought of the treatment that had been tendered by the religious hoodlums. Since then the building has been standing vacant, the windows still as the hoodlums left them, and still giving testimony that religion is a fraud.

It was on that ground that he fired Helge C. Peterson, 33, a substitute clerk in his office. Of course, he did this because pressure was exerted upon him by outside parties, but he should have been man enough to act as the president said he had a right to act. Oh well, Peterson will probably be able to support his wife and baby some other way.

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Incan</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Devil is always bringing forth substitutes for the Kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Human history is mostly a resume of his efforts in that direction. In one part of the world he may have a dalai lama, ■claiming to be Buddha again descended to the earth; in another, a mikado, earthly representative of the gods, and tracing his ancestry back to them; in another, somebody with a triple crown, claiming to be vicegerent of Almighty God; and in several more places, “kings, queens, jacks and the deuce” that claim that God has entrusted earth’s rulership to their tender care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So it was quite the ordinary, artmnd A,D. 1020, that the Devil caused Manco Capac (“Manco the Ruler”) to appear on the shores of earth’s highest navigable lake, Lake Titicaca, now on the southeastern border of Peru, claiming to be one of the gods, and to have come down, with Mama Oello, his wife and sister, to teach the people how to live. (How like Nimrod and Semiramis!) Like all the Devil’s chosen vessels, this man had some workable ideas. He instructed the men in agriculture, the arts, religion (!), and social and national organization, with himself, of course, as the father and high priest of the people. Mama, his wife, taught the women to sew’, to spin and to weave. Neither of them knew how to read or write, but they had a system of records made of ropes of different colors, with knots at irregular intervals. No one today can make head or tail of these quipu ropes. Manco lasted forty years, when he, traditionally, “ascended to his father the sun”; that is, he croaked, and is still dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Manco's Capital at Cuzco</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Manco established his capital at Cuzco, Peru, 11,380 feet above sea level, from which he caused roads to be built to what he described as the four'quarters of the world. One road led to Quito, the present capit&amp;l of Ecuador, a second to Chile, a</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Theocracy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">third to the ocean, and a fourth over the Andes. He established sun-worship on a most elaborate scale. The temple of the sun, circular in form, contained an image of the sun of beaten gold; the walls were covered with gold discs; the mummies of the Incas were later kept here and were decked with gold ornaments. A door encased in silver led to a chapel dedicated to the sun-goddess, who, to start with, was Mama Oello. In this chapel all the images, furnishings and decorations were of silver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The walls of the temple of the sun were built of stones of irregular size, but were cut with such accuracy that neither knife nor needle can be inserted at the seams. The image of the sun, above mentioned, was a human face in gold. When the early beams of the morning sun fell upon it, they were reflected to numberless plates, cornices, bands and images, until the whole temple was filled with golden light more intense than the sunshine of nature. All this, of course, inspired by the demons, was in mockery of the true light shining into God’s true temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Manco and his successors, who were his natural sons, believed in paternal government and practiced it. Order and civilization accompanied conquest, and each tribe that was vanquished found itself under laws, rules and regulations remarkably like those so long in use in China and Japan, to which, no doubt, their origin will sometime be traced. In China as in Peru the emperor took the title of “father of his people” and claimed io be heaven-descended. In all three lands agriculture received and still receives first attention. The Incas developed the potato from a wild bitter tuber, and they grew cotton long before Columbus was born. Labor was enforced upon all for the benefit of all. The wants of the people were few and easily satisfied. There were frequent holidays and festivals. Large flocks of llamas were grazed on the plateaus* while the hardy vicunas and alpacas roamed the upper heights in freedom but were driven together at stated periods to be shorn and killed. The wool yielded by these animals and the cotton grown in the plains and valleys were woven into fabrics remarkable for their fineness pf texture and brilliancy of color. Even to this very day the songs of the natives mourn the happy days of peace, security and comfort of the days of the Incas. The Incas, of course, believed and taught the Devil’s lie of the immortality of the human soul; so the future w’as thought to be either one of ease and tranquillity for the “good” or one of wearisome labor for the “wicked”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hoodwinking the Common People</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The demons get their fun out of hoodwinking the common people, while at the same time they manage to bring dishonor to Jehovah’s name. So the Inpa was set , up as both a temporal sovereign and the supreme pontiff, with his Vatican at Cuzco. He was regarded as the descendant of the sun, who was supposed to inspire his counsels and speak through his decrees. Nobody could come into his presence except in bare feet. Whether or not they were supposed to kiss his big toe is unknown. Maybe they did; they still do it just outside of Rome, to one of his fellow frauds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Inca race was held sacred; but men are men and women are women, and so the emperor and other males of the blood royal kept large harems stocked with beauties’drawn from all parts of the empire. Rapidly the blood of the children of the sun was blended with that of the children of the earth; but the Incas got away with it, were blindly obeyed and treated with a respect bordering on adoration, by the nobles as well as the common people. In those days all Peru worshiped the sun, the moon, the evening star, thunder, and the rainbow, and there ivere temples in Cuzco to all these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The state blended moral and civil duties, did away with money, made.and enforced rules for eating, sleeping, tilling, building, and sharing food with one another, and the. people were rapidly robbed of all their independence and initiative. They became mere machines and so became an easy prey to their' successors, the Spaniards. In four hundred years the Inca dominion extended from the equatorial valleys of the Amazon to the temperate plains of Chile, and from the sandy shores of the Pacific to the marshy sources of the Paraguay.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5"> SAID to the prejudiced lady: “You cannot judge this message by any individual. Let me play an hour’s lecture for you by the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and then you can make an intelligent decision.” She said, “Well, I have been a Catholic all my life, and I have surely heard what the other side has to say. Bring it tomorrow and I will hear your side.” When the lecture “Religion” was over she said, “It was not at all what I expected. You are not the fifth column. It is the Catholic Hierarchy that is the fifth column.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>I Expected’</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Then she took my hand and said, “I want to tell you something. Before Mrs. Rae testified against you folks, we talked it over and I told her it was her duty to do all she could to stop you. I always said I would turn any of you away that stopped at my door. If Mrs. Rae had heard this lecture she never would have said what, she did in court. Why, it was all a lie, but she never knew it. God only knows how I need light on the Bible. Please come as soon as you can and bring those books; I want them.”—Mrs. H. R. Conrow, Mississippi.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Law Enforcement in Lancaster</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">C</span><span class="font5">ALIFORNIA has a state law against public gambling, and, inasmuch as ' the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has only contempt for American laws, and never hesitates to break them, and to encourage * others to do so, it started a &quot;big gambling <sup>4</sup> event at Lancaster in that state. Somebody tipped off the sheriff’s office, and deputies swooped down, arrested six men,'and grabbed the sum of $448.05 of the swag and the gambling equipment that contained it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sheriff’s office did not know the Hierarchy. They were all .prepared for just such an occasion. Sitting as master of ceremonies of the illegal gambling was Justice William I). Keller, who is some peach of a judge, and before whom the Hierarchy knew the case would have to be tried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The big day came. All six of the guilty men claimed innocence, though they were actually caught with the goods. The sheriff, Biscailuz, issued an apology. He did not know that the gambling was religious gambling. Had he known it was religious, then no matter how unlawful it was he would not have touched it with a ten-foot polp. He was not for law and order: he was for religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And then the decision was up to Judge Keller. Some judge. First he had the deputy district attorney, Donald Avery, rise and ask for dismissal of the case. Avery said that if he went on with it and stood by the law it would make him a-persecutor rather than a prosecutor. And then the judge on the bench said, “This unfortunate, action should never have occurred, and it seems to me that the officers responsible for the raid should be reduced in rank or otherwise disciplined.” With that, the judge dismissed the case and turned the $448.05 of swag over to the “Reverend Father” Charles Kennedy, pastor of the Sacred Heart Catholic church, who has operated this illegal gambling racket for years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you wish to publicly violate the gambling laws in California, be sure that you have the right judge on the bench, so that if some deputy sheriff takes it into his head to carry out his oath of office, and faithfully administers the law impartially, you can just show him that he can’t do that in California. But, of course, he can conduct himself illegally as against the rights of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the “best citizens”, like Kennedy, will be glad to say, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Here is a slice of the swag.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>What the United Nations Are Supposedly Fighting For</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">G</span><span class="font5">OOD news comes to us from several army and navy training camps and is confirmed by several official U.S. shortwave broadcasts to the far nations of the world. Our men at last are being told why we are at war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our short-wave broadcasts differ from most of the news broadcasts and from the buncombe mixed with laxative ads of our world-renowned news commentators, many of them reactionaries in the pay of the worst reactionaries in America.: Over the short wave we appeal to the common people of all countries, people invaded'by the Fascists, people of neutral and people of Fascist countries, and we are not ashamed to speak of the great democratic American ideals, and the coming century of the common man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that we are telling our own new army of millions the truth about the world’s first enemy, Fascism, and that we are asking all the people of the world to unite to destroy this enemy, is of utmost importance because up to recently no such enlightenment was possible. On the other hand, frightening reports were being circulated throughout the country of reactionary teachings in certain camps, of strike-breaking drill, and of officers who in civilian life had been affiliated with native Fascist and Nazi movements and who continued to spread anti-democratic propaganda in the camps. Today, however, soldiers vjrite us of the splendid morale in camps where the .men want to destroy the Fascist enemy, not only in Africa but in Europe and Asia. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unfortunately, however, although it is now possible to attack faraway Fascism, it is still impossible to expose, attack and destroy the equivalent Fascist ideas, organizations, movements and propagandists in our own country. Beware of the impostures of pretended patriotism, the founder of our country warned us in his farewell address, and today considerable Fascism at home is tied up with red, white and blue ribbon and appears 'under a waving flag in newspapers and magazines which even shout “Our Country, Bight or Wrong” while subtly propagandizing the inhuman doctrine of Fascism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is obvious that there are elements still working against a greater democracy, against an America without discrimination based on race, color and creed, an America where never again will one third of the people be without sufficient food, clothing and shelter, where never again will there be 12,000,000 unemployed and many more millions working for semi-starvation wages while the Du Pont, Ford, Hearst, Mellon and Bockefeller empires soar into the billions of dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I call all these elements Fascist. You may not like names and labels, but technically as well as journalistically arid morally they are correct. You may substitute Tories, or Economic Royalists, or Vested. Interests, or whatever you like for the flag-waving anti-American Americans whose efforts and-objectives parallel those of the Inga Industriale which bought out Mussolini in 1920, and the Thyssen - Krupp - Voegeler - Flick Rhineland industry and banking system which subsidized Hitler when Nazism was about to collapse. Their main object was to end the civil liberties of the nation, destroy the labor-unions, end the free press, and make more money at the expense of a slave nation. Both succeeded. And in America one similar organization has already made the following historical record:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. Organized big business in a movement against labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. Founded the Liberty League to fight civil liberties.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. Subsidized anti-labor, Fascist and anti - Semitic organizations (Senator Black’s Lobby Investigation).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. Signed a pact with Nazi agents for political and economic (cartel) penetration of U.S. (Exposed in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In Fad)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. Founded a $l.,000,00()-a-year propaganda outfit to corrupt the press, radio, schools and churches.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ 6. Stopped the passage of food, drug and other laws aimed to safeguard the consumer, i.e., 132,000,000 Americans.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">7. Conspired with Du Pont as leader, in September, 1942, to sabotage the war effort in order to maintain profits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">8. Sabotaged the U.S. defense plan in 1940 by refusing to convert the auto plants and by a sit-down of capital against plant expansion; sabotaged the oil, aluminum and rubber expansion programs. (If any of these facts are not known to you it is because 99 percent of our press, in the pay of the same elements, suppressed the Tolan, Truman, Bone Committee reports, Thurman Arnold’s reports, the TNEC .Monopoly reports, and other government documents. )</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">9. Delayed the winning of the war through the actions of $-a-year men looking out for present profits and future monopoly rather than the quick defeat of Fascism. (Documented in the labor press for two years; and again at the 1942 CIO convention)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Naturally enough the president of the United States and other high officials cannot name the men, organizations, pressure lobbyists, and national associations which have made this and similar records; they can only refer to “noisy traitors,” Quislings, defeatists, the “Cliveden Set” or to the Tories and economic royalists. And you may be certain that our press will never name the defeatists, because the same elements that made the above 9-point record are the main advertisers and biggest subsidizers of the newspapers and magazines. In many instances even the general charges by the president himself have been suppressed. In Germany, in Italy, until the seizure of government by the Fascists, the majority of newspapers were brave enough to be anti-Fascist, whereas in America, strangely enough, a large part of the press (Hearst, Scripps-Howard, McCormick-Patterson) has for years been pro-Faseist and almost all big papers live on the money of the biggest Tory and reactionary corporations and reflect their viewpoint now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the anti-Fascist side, unfortunately, there is not one publication which can boast of more than one or two hundred thousand circulation, whereas the reactionary press has its New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font5"> with 2,000,000 daily, its </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday, Evening Post</span><span class="font5"> with 3,000,000 weekly, and its </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest</span><span class="font5"> with 7,000,000 monthly, which means up to 40,000,000 readers. Liberal weeklies costing $5 a year have rarely passed the 50,000 mark. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact,</span><span class="font5"> at $1 a year, has found 100,000 supporters. Most publications on the side of the people vs. reaction exist through subsidies, gifts, money-raising campaigns. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact</span><span class="font5"> has been selfsupporting from its first day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it is a shameful and tragic situation that in America, with 132,000,000 persons of whom 40,000,000 read antilabor and anti-liberal propaganda in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest,</span><span class="font5"> only a few hundred thousand buy and .read intelligent, honest, unbribed, unc'orrupted publications, issued in the public interest. We believe that millions would turn to the press which is on their side in the world conflict of Democracy vs. Fascism, if they were more aware of the conflict right here in America' and if the publications which are on their side were made known to them. The anti-Tory, anti-Fascist press in America can’t run million-dollar promotion campaigns. —George Seldes, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>“Tale of a City”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Office of War Information, Washington, D.C., has published a handsome 24-page illustrated booklet on the Nazification of Warsaw, from which the following paragraphs have been selected. The entire booklet may be had by addressing the Division of Public Inquiries at the address above given:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Warsaw resisted the heavy artillery guns and dive bombers of the Nazis for twenty-one-days. On the twenty-second day, its water supply gone, its dead still lying in the streets, the city surrendered. There was food for three more days, munitions for one. ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Residents of Warsaw were given three days </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">dear the streets of rubble and bodies, and on October 1, 1939, German troops, marched into the city. As reward for their victory, General von Brau chits ch granted twenty-four hours of freedom in which to loot suburban houses. Told to loot, they looted. Otherwise, they maintained complete discipline. German army trucks, loaded with loaves of bread, were stationed at several prominent intersections. Poles who stood in line to receive the bread noticed that each scene was being carefully recorded by newsreel cameras. “A more pleading expression,” urged the cameramen. Disgusted, many Poles turned away. Pictures of this dole were later shown in German theaters, captioned, “German soldiers sharing food with their erstwhjle enemies.” In other parts of the city during the first three days 300,000 helpings of thin soup and black bread were passed out to the accompaniment of German bands playing waltzes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The music soon ended. The pattern of occupation became clear. The city was billed 300,000 zlotys ($60,000) for the soup and bread of the first three days. Lazienki Park, oldest and largest in Warsaw, was closed to Poles. Blasted from its pedestal, Chopin’s monument was melted down and seijt to Hitler as a gift from his troops. Scientific laboratories that had escaped destruction during the siege were dismantled, and their equipment shipped to Germany. More than 100,000 books in the Central Military Library were burned, as the invaders honeycombed every library in the city, removing all books by “non-Aryan” authors and all volumes dealing with Polish-German relations. Warsaw museums were scientifically robbed of their treasures, lists having been drawn up in advance by Nazi tourists who had noted the choicest collections. Poles were forbidden to travel by train in first-or second-class cars. Jews were barred entirely from trains. Front sections of streetcars were reserved for Germans. The Polish press was suspended. Hotels in Warsaw were closed to Poles, as were the waiting rooms of railroad stations. Pilsudski Square wps reehris-* tened Adolf Hitler Platz. One hundred and nineteen members of the Warsaw Bar Association were thrown into jail, including the association’s eighty-year-old president. None but Germans were permitted on the streets from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. Violators of the curfew were shot on sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Once the Gestapo became settled in War-■ saw, with some one thousand officers and five thousand troops, no man’s life could be called his own. The invaders passed a series of legal decrees authorizing themselves to steal all Polish property. For weeks on end the covered trucks of the Gestapo rumbled out of Warsaw, headed for Germany and laden with furniture, rugs, jewels, furs, paintings, house. hold equipment, all manner and description of Polish personal property, all seized without payment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bread is about the only thing the Poles can count upon eating; they have been permitted less than five slices a day. This winter there may be no bread for Poles in Warsaw. Forty percent sawdust, the bread is dark and indigestible, Many families are subsisting on a thin potato soup, without meat and containing a few cabbage leaves and beets. Food cards theoretically entitle the Poles each week to slightly more tlian three ounces of meat (the equivalent in the United States, say, of one thin chop); each month to three and a half ounces of flour and sugar, four and a half ounces of marmalade, and one egg. They rarely receive these. Meat, when sold, is malodorous and mostly bone. No provision is made on the food cards for butter, cheese, or green vegetables. Adults may not receive milk, an adult being anybody older than six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Warsaw in winter has an average temperature of five below zero (F\); it sometimes drops to twenty below. During the winter of 1940-41 Germans allowed the Poles one bucketful of coal every six or eight weeks. Coal this winter will be available only on the black market, where a half ton costs in the neighborhood of $160. At the beginning of the occupation, Nazis seized all apartment houses and offices in Warsaw with steam heat. Into these buildings, and these buildings alone, now goes the coal from the abundant mines of Upper Silesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before the policy of total extermination went into effect, more than half a million Jews were packed into the Ghetto, a dismal section of 100 blocks in the northern part of Warsaw, surrounded by an 8-foot wall topped by broken glass. No one could enter or leave without a pass, . . . Seeking food outside the Ghetto, bands of boys crept through holes in bombed buildings and emerged from cellars and excavations. They roamed the streets of Warsaw, begging. Jewish police within the Ghetto and Polish police outside its walls turned their backs on this activity. Germans maintained a bicycle guard around the Ghetto wall, Constantly circling in search of persons who had left without ^permission. Some months ago Nazi soldiers caught a small boy who was returning to the Ghetto with a bag of food. Lifting a manhole cover, they dropped the boy into a sewer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The body of a sixteen-year-old boy who broke the 8 p.ra. curfew was returned to his parents with* a small card pinned to his suit. The card simply said “8:15”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From all of Poland, nearly half a million prisoners of war are now bending their backs in Germany; another million Poles have been uprooted from their homes in the West and shipped like cattle to the East; another million Ifcive been sent to labor camps in occupied Russian territory; another million and a half have been dragged into the Reich as farm and industrial slaves. A typical case of the Nazi net took place in Kereelak market place, Warsaw, one morning in May, 1942. In the old days, before the Nazis, Kereelak market place had been a flamboyant and colorful bazaar, its food booths piled high with meats, cheese, fruits, and vegetables from tile countryside. On this May morning a heavy sadness hung over the market. Most of the booths were closed. A few’ rickety ones were still open, their sallow proprietors offering wooden shoes for sale, or a pair of pants. Several thousand men and women milled about, carrying old and tattered bits of clothing over their arms, hoping to exchange them for scraps of food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Into the square goose-stepped a detachment of German soldiers, lustily singing. People paid scant attention to them: the Germans are forever marching and, besides, these soldiers were singing. When the detachment reached the center of the square it suddenly broke ranks, small groups making for every exit. From nowhere appeared the vans and lorries of the Gestapo. Machine guns were trained on the crowd. “Aehtung 1” came the shouted command through a megaphone, ‘‘‘Stand where you are or be shot.” The thousands in Kerce-lak market place froze in their tracks. Soon the square had been emptied, the thousands poured into the Gestapo vans and driven to a house on Skaryszewska street for questioning. Heavy labor was separated from light and farm labor, young women from old. Some of the young girls were reserved for the exclusive use of the German army. Country girls were assigned to the troops, daughters of once-wcalthy city folks were turned over to officers. By evening the catch was on its way into the darkness of the Reich, locked in freight ears. In all, the catch had netted 3,000 persons. Their families were not notified.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Position of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy Toward the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(In Three</span><span class="font3"> Parts—Part 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N THE fifteenth century printing from movable type was invented, and the first work turned out by inventor Gutenberg’s press was the Latin Bible, about the year 1456. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy promptly turned the printing press to its own ends. In 1522 Cardinal Ximenes, of Spain’s university at Alcala or Complutum, published the celebrated Complutensian Polyglot, being a Bible edition in'many tongues. The first Jour volumes set out the so-called “Old Testament” with the Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, in three columns, and also the Targuin or Chaldee paraphrase and a Latin translation of the same. The position of the Latin version between the original Hebrew and the' Greek version was designedly made, so as to symbolize the cardinal’s opinion that just as Christ Jesus was impaled between two thieves, so the Roman Catholic religious sect as represented by Jerome’s Vulgate version was “crucified” between the Hebrew synagogue and the Eastern or Greek Orthodox religious sect. The fifth volume of the Polyglot set out the Greek “New Testament” and the Latin Vulgate alongside. Such an expensive work was not meant for the people’s use and instruction in Holy Writ, even as it was not made to include a popular tongue, but was only in dead languages. Six hundred copies of this work were printed, limiting circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now came the rise of. Martin Luther in Germany, and his complete break with the Hierarchy in 1521.-The following year this reformer began translating the Bible from the Latin Vulgate into German. He started with the Christian Scriptures, and, these finished, then in 1525 he began translating the ancient Scriptures, part by part, and completed these in 1534. This translation roused great indignation and opposition on the part of the Hierarchy, and pope Leo X issued a bull against Luther. But the Hierarchy’s sorrows respecting God’s Word in a popular tongue were now only begun. In 1535 the complete Bible was printed in English for the first time; it was the edition by Myles Coverdale. However, it had been preceded by William Tyndale’s translation of the Christian writings, which was printed and published at an unknown place on the European continent in 1525. Copies thereof found their way into England in quantity. In 1526 the bishop of London thundered out his prohibition against Tyndale’s “New Testament”, and two years afterward a number of copies were collected (some had even been purchased for the purpose of being destroyed), and were burned in London at St. Paul’s Cross. Just the same, copies continued to be smuggled into England, despite the rage of Cardinal Wolsey and the denunciation of Tyndale by the “sainted” Sir Thomas More, the Catholic champion. Tyndale was finally betrayed and was seized, imprisoned, and condemned, and was strangulated at the stake and then burned, in 1536. While he was in prison Coverdale’s Bible edition was printed and issued, but outside of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other English Bible editions followed, such as “Matthew’s Bible” (1537), the “Great Bible” (1539), the “Geneva Bible” (1560), and the “Bishops’ Bibl$” (1568). An English Bible was printed for the first time in England itself in 1538, after King Henry VIII had broken off with the pope of Rome. It became plain that, since the Roman Catholic Hierarchy could not stop the production of the Bible in the popular tongue and its distribution to the common people of England, they must do something to counteract the influence of the nonCatholic Bible editions. Many exiled English Roman . Catholics had taken refuge in Europe, and the city Douai, then in the Netherlands, became the center of their political and religious activities. By such refugees the English Boman Catholic Version of the “New 'Testament” was published at the English College of Rheims, France, in 1582. The “Old Testament” was not published till 1610, when it was issued at Douai. The complete work, known as the “Rheims and Douay Version”, was merely a secondary translation of the Scriptures through the medium of Jerome’s Latin Vulgate. It contained a strongly Latinized vocabulary, and was marked by extreme literalness therefore, and by stiff, uncertain renderings, which were at times beyond understanding except by a reference to the Latin original. The English bishop, Richard Chailoner, became vice-president of Douay University in 1720, and he was used to revise the English Douay Version in 1749-1750. , The Douay Bible version never attained to the popularity and circulation of the Protestant version Bible which closely followed it, in 1611, namely, the King James Version, commonly called the “Authorized Version”. This latter version became the most widely circulated edition of the Bible in the world; and hence it is against this that the opposition of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been specially leveled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to its own testimony the Bible was meant by God for use by all persons seeking salvation through Christ Jesus. In the early centuries of the Christian church, before the establish-/ ment of the Roman &lt;J*tholic Hierarchy and its papacy, the universal examination and study of the Holy Scriptures was not only allowed, but also approved and encouraged by those who held responsible positions in the true church. It . was not uiltil the general reading of the Bible was found to interfere with the claims of the papacy that the Hierarchy. discovered<sup>;</sup> in the people’s study of the Bible .“perils for the common mind”. As the use of Latin disappeared from among the people, the Vulgate Version became less and less understandable to them, and this development served as an opportune aid to the Hierarchy schemes for power and dominance over the masses of the people. In the eleventh century pope Gregory VII, in his Epistle VII, expressly thanked God for .this-circumstance, as tending to save ' the people from misunderstanding the Bible. In 1229 the Council of Toulouse (France), in its fourteenth canon, “forbids the laity .to have in their possession any copy of the books of the Old and New Testament, except the Psalter, and such portions of them as are contained in the Breviary, or the Hours of the Virgin; and most strictly forbids these works in the vulgar tongue.” In 1242 the Council of Tarragona (Spain) directed its attention against the Waldenses who made, the first Bible translation into French (Romanza), and it ordered all vernacular versions to be brought to the bishop to be burnt. Similar prohibitions were issued from time to time during the next two centuries by bishops and synods, especially in France and Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reformers and so-called “heretics” always referred to the Holy Scriptures as their authority, thus exposing the false claims of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy; hence the Hierarchy’s fanatical efforts to shut out the written Word of God from the common people. “Ten Rules Concerning Prohibited Books” were drawn up by order of the Council of Trent (Austria) in 1562' (Session XVIII), and approved by pope Pius IV. In Rule III it is stated that versions of the “Old Testament” may be “allowed only to pious and‘learned men at the discretion of tire bishop”; in Rule IV it is stated that “if the sacred books be permitted in the vulgar tongue indiscriminately, more harm than utility arises therefrom by reason of the temerity of men”. The bishop or inquisitor was authorized to grant permission to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">safe</span><span class="font5"> persons to read them; all book-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sellers selling to .unauthorized persons , were to be punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1687 the celebrated French priest, Quesnel, brought out a translation of the Scriptures called the “New Testament in French, with Moral Reflections”. This contained such notes as these: “The reading of the Sacred Scriptures is for all”; “the obscurity of the Sacred Word is no reason for laymen to dispense themselves from reading it&quot;; “the Lord’s day ought to be sanctified by Christians for works of piety, and, above all, for the reading of the Sacred Scriptures.” In 1713 pope Clement Xi’s bull entitled Unigenitus (from its first word) was directed against Quesnel’s translation and its notes, condemning a hundred and one propositions from it. Here was direct proof, by a reputedly &quot;infallible” pope, that the Roman Catholic religious organization hides the Bible from the people. There was a reaction to the bull Uni-genitus even among some Roman Catholic bishops, who disagreed with it and who encouraged the reading of the Scriptures in the people’s tongue; but such bishops were not representative of the Hierarchy of Authority at the Vatican.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Drying and Remaking Milk</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Charles Edward North, of New</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">York, has invented a method for drying milk which permits of its returning to its former liquid state any time within a period of two years. The reconstituted milk cannot be distinguished from the original article, because the process of dehydration carefully controls the temperature. Milk heated above 159° Fahrenheit picks up the characteristic cooked taste and also loses some of its food value. In Dr. North’s method of drying it, the butterfat and skim milk are dehydrated at different temperatures. Both dehydrates will keep at any temperature thereafter if packed in - sterile containers. They may be mixed for use in varying proportions to make skim milk, whole milk, light or heavy cream, butter, ice cream, or even buttermilk. The dehydrated product permits of great savings in shipping costs and will prove of immense benefit, as in many parts of the world there have never been adequate milk supplies. As the reconstituted product tastes just like natural milk, it is possible that it will take the place of the real article artiong city populations, as it will make possible great savings in transportation and refrigeration costs. That saving may be passed along to the consumer; but of that one should not be too hopeful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Tremendous Value of Holy Mass’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The so-called “Holy Mass” is not mentioned anywhere in the Scriptures, and bears itio more relation to the Memorial Supper than the Devil does to Almighty God. This by way of introduction to a leaflet put out by The Sacred Heart Mass League, Ste. Marie, Jasper county, Illinois. Everybody knows that the mass is a money-making racket. &quot;High money, high mass; low money, low mass'; no money, no mass,” yet in their folder the league says, “Every such Mass will go with you to Judgment to plead for you. Nothing on earth, no prayer, and no act of penance, can be compared with the tremendous value and power of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Through these Holy Masses you will be blessed in your temporal goods and affairs and preserved from many dangers which would otherwise befall you.” The idea is that if you already have lots of kale, and spend it for masses, you will get lots more kale. But if you have no money to start with, and can’t buy any masses, then you get no kale. It is just as simple as that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
