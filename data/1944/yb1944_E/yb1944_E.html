<p><span class="font9">1944 YEARBOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is all-powerful and has proved himself to be the Supreme One of the universe. Proof of this has been made known time and time again, and there are myriads of witnesses to testify to this fact. There will be many more witnesses of Jehovah as time goes on, who will witness proof of Jehovah’s supremacy. The report of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses fo’r the service year 1942-1943, which is here submitted, is a present-day proof of His almighty power working through His servants to accomplish His will in face of the oppositions of Satan the Devil. The issue has been forced by the adversary of God: Will a man serve Jehovah for an unselfish purpose? or can a man be free and still have a desire to honor and praise his Maker? A great cloud of witnesses have already answered the above questions in the affirmative, not by merely saying “yes”, but by living a life to prove it. Jehovah’s witnesses today are endeavoring to likewise give an affirmative answer on the issue by exercising their Christian freedom to serve Jehovah God faithfully to the completion of His “strange work” in the earth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5">The freest man ever to live upon this earth was the Son of God, Christ Jesus. He is still free, possesses eternal life and can fulfill his desire, which is to honor and praise his Father throughout all eternity. No man can be free hemmed in by the bondage of sin, religion and the Devil. It is Satan the Devil who took away the freedom from man and gave him toil, sickness, sorrow and, finally, death. Man could have had, and was offered, peace, prosperity and life everlasting 6 in a righteous world. He was placed in the garden of Eden, with a companion, and there had full liberty to multiply, fill the earth and subdue the earth. What more freedom could a man ask for? The Devil, deceiver of man, however, turned the first pair, Adam and Eve, away from Jehovah. They chose a creature’s theory rather than God’s true promise, thus showing they had no faith in God. Their choice led them to bondage and death, not to freedom. Because the first pair followed the teachings or traditions of a creature, Satan, every one that lives now has been born in sin and shapen in iniquity, and thus has been subjected to bondage by the Devil. But provision has been made so that creatures can be made free, and many of them have been made free because of accepting Christ Jesus and following him as the Liberator. There is no need for any creature to follow traditions of men; for he can be free to follow the Word of God. Each creature must make his choice, to follow either truth or tradition.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>JEHOVAH’S PEOPLE KEPT FREE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">When one reads the accounts in the Bible of the faithful men of old he sees clearly how Jehovah God has kept His people free. Free from what ? Free from the Devil’s organization, its oppression, its darkness, its religion, and its sin; free from being a servant of the god of this world, Satan the Devil. Jehovah freed Noah from the “world that then was” by causing it to be overflowed with water, and God brought him through the flood into the present world. He restated to Noah the divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth with a righteous people. This picture of Noah coming from the old world through the flood into the new was a picture of a free nation being delivered from the sin-corruption of the Devil’s world. Noah and his companions were freed from the old world that was destroyed by the flood. The eight survivors who maintained their integrity and continued their worship of God were kept free from the traditions taught prior to the flood and which led to death. Noah and his companions chose the Word of God and lived through the flood. However, immediately after the flood, the present world was overtaken by the Devil in the reorganization of his invisible hosts. Therefore Satan is called “the god of this world”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even as Noah and his companions stood free from that old world of wickedness, so today Jehovah’s witnesses and their associates are free from the Satan-dominated world, and they are the only representatives and proclaimers of the New World of righteousness. These people, Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, represent the free nation and will go through the greatest catastrophe ever to befall man, the battle of Armageddon, into the New World to come, a world without end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again Jehovah God freed his people when in bondage in Egypt, and took off them the yoke of Pharaoh. He made them a free people, to stay free, if they so chose. But did they ? In his typical Theocratic arrangement the Israelites time and time again went into bondage of religion, sin and the Devil, and were freed from this condition by their covenant-keeping God; but they had to fight for it, and had to make a stand against the wickedness of the Devil and follow the laws which Jehovah set forth for their direction. The Israelites had the perfect law of God, but they failed to keep it. This law, if kept, would have held them free from the bondage of all the nations round about; and, if followed, would have been a schoolmaster to lead them unto Christ, the Savior and Liberator of humankind. The Israelites as a nation failed to heed the warnings of God and to follow his Word, but chose tradition, religion, and thus received bondage from the Devil’s organization rather than freedom, which was theirs if they had chosen to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the past sixty centuries Jehovah has always had some free men and women as his witnesses —men and women who were not bound by the traditions of the religious fathers handed down from generation to generation. These men were free to worship Jehovah “in spirit and in truth”, and this they did, regardless of all the oppression, trials and difficulties that were brought upon them so that, if possible, they might be shackled and brought into the bondage of this present evil world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then, nineteen hundred years ago, because God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten Son, “that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” That Son of God was Christ Jesus, the Redeemer of the human family. No longer was it necessary for any individual to stay under the bondage of this devilish old world; but full provision was made for them to come out of the old world into the New World which Jehovah loved, a world of righteousness, and there serve God in his organization. Christ Jesus became the mediator between God and man, even as Moses was the mediator of the old covenant between the children of Israel and Jehovah God. The Jews could have remained free, if they had refrained from following after religion and heeding the advice of scribes and Pharisees, religionists of their day; and if they had refrained from associating with the nations of this world and followed the Word of God. Had they done this, they would have recognized Christ Jesus as God’s Son and accepted the freedom that Christ brought them. The apostles did, and other early Christians who trod this earth likewise did so. They accepted the freedom, and now enjoy everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus when upon the earth was not held in bondage by the Devil’s organization, nor did he have himself weighted down with fetters and the cares of this world. He was a free man. He was in the world, that was true, but not a part of it. He had no place to lay his head, so he says. Therefore he must have had no cares of this world. He was not burdened down with business, politics, religion, the keeping of some store or the maintaining of a home. He rendered unto Caesar those things that were Caesar’s, such as taxes necessary to be paid. But as a perfect man, the Son of God, possessing full freedom, he had one thing to do and one desire that he wished to fulfill; that was to continue in the proper worship of his heavenly Father and proclaim the message that his Father had sent him to earth to proclaim, as His witness and vindicator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus had the right to life. He was a perfect man and he spoke words of wisdom which were words of life. That which he spoke to his hearers was words from his heavenly Father; for he was directed to speak the truth. He had no fear of religion or religionists, or the rulers of this world; he had no fear of commercial organizations that existed, for he was no part of them; he had no fear of the politicians or the totalitarian state that then ruled, for he was not a supporter of it. He did not cast his lot in with any organization or scheme of men; he was free from all these bonds. He was born a free man, the Son of God, and he maintained that freedom. Jesus made clear to Pilate why He was in the world. He said: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18:37) He was absolutely free to proclaim the message of the Kingdom, and to show the people the way to life and the way out of the wicked organization of the Devil into the New World of righteousness. He, being a free man, could teach others how to be free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Master’s own positive statement is that “the truth shall make you free”. (John 8: 32) Throughout his life upon the earth Jesus pursued a course of instructing and teaching his followers. He knew the importance of their receiving true knowledge. By obtaining knowledge of the truth, which is the Word of God, it is possible for creatures to become free. It is essential, therefore, that creatures who want to be free from the Devil’s organization receive knowledge and understanding concerning God’s Word, so that the truth will make them free also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The obtaining of truth does not come in any easy manner; it comes by hard work and continuous study. There must be a ‘renewing of the mind’ so as to get rid of all the error and corruption of the traditions and religious teachings. These old ideas must be cleared out of the head before it can be filled with truth. Freedom is something, then, that must be worked for. All creatures have been shackled by the Devil with sin and religion. These two, sin and religion, must be gotten rid of, and the one whom we follow must be Christ Jesus, the Righteous Ruler of the New World. The apostle James states it well: “But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.” (Jas. 1:25) Anyone who looks into the “perfect law of liberty” and expects to be made free and remain that way must, of necessity, continue to study the law of liberty, which is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, he may not be a forgetful hearer; but he must be a doer of that which he has heard. One cannot just listen to the Word of God as expounded by Christ Jesus or the apostles, or by a present-day witness of Jehovah, and agree and say “That’s right” and expect to receive life or the freedom enjoyed by creatures who have the truth. The apostle James says that if you want to continue in this law of liberty and this freedom you must also be a doer or a worker, not a forgetful hearer. One who retains the truth in his mind, and believes it, will work in its interest. If you are a worker, you will be blessed in your deeds, or in your own doing. Therefore freedom comes with activity, a course of action governed by God’s Word, the “perfect law of liberty”. True knowledge is important. You must make it your own, and then proclaim that knowledge to others. The apostle Paul makes it clear and shows that the freedom we have received through Christ Jesus is for the purpose of proclaiming this freedom to others. His words are: “For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.” (Gal. 5:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> The freedom from sin’s condemnation that we possess through the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus is so that we might be a free people; and it is for freedom’s sake that we have been set free, no longer to go back into the yoke of bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus came to earth not only to redeem the human family, but his principal purpose was far greater than that, namely, the vindication of his Father’s Word and name. It is for this very purpose that Christ Jesus has set us free ; that we too might share in the vindication work of proclaiming the truth and maintaining our integrity above all things. One who maintains his integrity and proclaims the message of truth concerning the Kingdom will be free from sin, religion, and the Devil and his entire organization. Jehovah’s witnesses have not been set free to be bound again by the yoke of bondage of this devilish organization; but, now that they have received freedom, they must stand fast for that freedom and hold high the banner of truth that they have received. Continuing in the truth and proclaiming the same shall keep them free. One who becomes a servant of the Most High, wholly consecrated to the Lord, will never go back into bondage again if he stays close to the truth. If he forsakes the truth and takes on tradition, then it will mean death, everlasting destruction, to that person. An individual can, if he wants to or allows himself to, drift back into the way of the flesh and sin of the Devil’s organization. However, Christ Jesus did not release humankind from bondage to drift back into the chains and fetters of wickedness of this old world. Christians were not made free to be later regimented and taken in by some “happy” scheme of the “new world order” and its leaders, based on what men have learned in times past. How can man learn to do right by practicing wickedness, carrying on war of aggression and destruction, and maintaining totalitarian rule over people </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> Man does not learn good by doing evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rulers of the world today do not choose to fear the Lord. As it is stated at Proverbs 1:30: “They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.” Mankind can only eat the fruit of its labors of the past six thousand years of sin and sorrow. Men will never be able to produce something better out of an old order. “Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.” (Prov. 1:31-33) Jesus, the great Educator and Teacher, when upon the earth made the statement that “whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock”. (Matt. 7:24) To have a building or a nation stand, the foundation principles of that nation must be based on the Word of God. Without this it will crumble. God’s righteous Kingdom is built on the principles of truth and righteousness, as it were, upon a solid rock, and it shall stand for ever. It is this Kingdom of Christ Jesus that Christians have been praying for, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religionists who intend to build up through the nations of this earth a better “new world order” have had the opportunity of hearing the sayings of Christ Jesus, but they have done them not. Therefore the Lord says that they shall be “likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand”. (Matt. 7:26) When the rains descend and the floods come, and the winds blow and beat upon the house that the Devil’s organization has builded up, and it falls, great shall be the fall of it. The battle of the great day of God Almighty will bring about the collapse of the Devil’s organization because its whole structure is built up on lies, the first lie being perpetrated in the garden of Eden. From then on the whole structure has been built on sand, and that operating up to Noah’s day was washed away in the Flood. The Devil’s reconstructed organization was builded of wood, hay and stubble. While his organization is greater in scope now, it will burn and be destroyed with even greater fury than his world at the time of the Flood. Those who build on truth and righteousness live on a Foundation that cannot be destroyed, but which will last forever; and that is God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses, from Abel down to John the Baptist, and from Christ Jesus to the present time, have stood for the truth, and this has made them free. Their only desire is to worship Jehovah God “in spirit and in truth” and to proclaim his message, and to make known the marvelous blessings of God unto their fellow creatures. Those who have the truth fully appreciate that life eternal comes only by a full knowledge of Jehovah God and the Son, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>KNOWLEDGE OR IGNORANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The psalmist David said: “Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God.” (Ps. 143:10) David wanted the freedom that comes only to creatures doing Jehovah’s will. He knew the only way he could receive that freedom was to be delivered out of the hands of the enemy ; for in verse 9 of the 143d Psalm he says, “Deliver me, 0 Lord, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.” Surely anyone in the hands of his enemies, or in fear of his enemies, cannot be free. Seeking the Lord to “teach me to do thy will” shows the proper spirit on the part of the creature; and that is the real spirit of the “faithful and wise servant” class of Jehovah God in the earth today. They are anxious to be taught the will of the Most High; for to have the truth will surely make them free, not only from their enemies visible, but also from those invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses, even though free, fully appreciate that as long as they are in the world they are going to be persecuted and meet with stiff opposition from the Devil’s organization; for at all times the Devil and his crowd will try to bring them back into the yoke of bondage. In this the Devil will always fail, if the servant keeps his feet in the right path. He must rely upon Jehovah God’s mercy to cut off his enemies and to destroy them. The “faithful and wise servant” today has full trust in Jehovah God that He will cut off all the enemies in His own due time. This cutting off will take place in completion at the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only free people in the world today are Jehovah’s witnesses, and this is because they have the truth and have been taught the same. People who are ignorant of the truth can never take a stand for freedom, and therefore they must be given knowledge first. Jehovah God forgives ignorance, as he did when dealing with the Israelites of old. In those days he provided an offering for sin of ignorance, as is pointed out in the 15th chapter of Numbers: “Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the Lord, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.” (Num. 15: 24) The priest in this manner made an atonement for the children of Israel, and they were forgiven because of their ignorance. Not only were all the children of Israel forgiven for their ignorance, but also the stranger and sojourner among them was forgiven for his ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This forgiveness of ignorance applied not only to the nation of Israel, but also to individuals. “And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sin-neth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.” (Num. 15: 27, 28) This law also applied to the stranger that sojourned among them, as well as the Israelite. However, if the person is not ignorant he is responsible. It must be assumed that, after they erred once and offered this offering unto the Lord, they were undoubtedly told the proper course to take. Thus they received knowledge and understanding and then responsibility was placed upon them, as is set forth in Numbers 15:30: “But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.” In other words, if one is not ignorant, but goes ahead high-handedly and does as he pleases, not recognizing the Lord’s command or judgment in the matter, then he is wholly responsible. This would apply to spiritual Israel, as well as to the “stranger”, the “other sheep”, within the gates of the Lord’s organization today. Thus it is seen that ignorance is forgiven when one repents and takes steps to correct the error. Proper education in and knowledge of the right course are brought to an individual by the Lord’s servants and thereafter the hearer is responsible before the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Paul was on Mars’ hill he told the Athenians that they were too superstitious. These Athenians had an altar with the inscription on it, “To the Unknown God.” Paul said they ignorantly worshiped that unknown God. Paul showed that the unknown God was the God that made the world and all things that were in it, the heavens, the earth, and that He did not dwell in temples made with hands. He further told them that God “winked at” their ignorance for a time; but now the command goes forth to all men everywhere to repent. “Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.” (Acts 17:31) It appears from Paul’s argument that he was telling the Athenians that they were not being held responsible for their worship in times past, but now they were no longer ignorant of these things, as the matter was made clear. Now having knowledge, the truth, they had to make a stand for righteousness, change their worship, because the day of judgment of the world in righteousness was sure to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no reason for people to be ignorant of the truth all their lives. People in “Christendom” know something about God, the Creator, but they do not know how to worship him “in spirit and in truth”. However, God sees to it that they are informed at the proper time. Because they have been held in ignorance by the Devil’s organization is no reason why they should remain that way. Now the time has come when they must have opportunity to learn the truth, because they are living in the last days. The obligation therefore falls upon Jehovah’s witnesses to remove this ignorance, the same as Paul removed the ignorance of the Athenians, and as Moses did that of the Jews, and tell them the truth regardless of how and where these people live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Peter in speaking to the Jews at the temple showed how they had killed the “Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead”, and that they were witnesses of this fact. He said: “And now, brethren, I know that in ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord.” (Acts 3:17-19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> It was through ignorance and following the leadership of the scribes and Pharisees that these Jews killed Jesus, or desired to see him killed. But now the opportunity came for Peter to give them knowledge, and for them to hear, and therefore they would be responsible, being no longer ignorant. This truth they heard would free them from religion and the oppression under which they had been held. Knowledge, therefore, brings responsibility; proper care of this responsibility brings life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Paul was very desirous of seeing his fellow Israelites saved. He knew that they were held in bondage, and what they needed was knowledge and understanding. His argument at Romans 10:1-3 is: “Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.” The Jews had the zeal all right, but they were not zealous according to the proper knowledge of God’s Word; they did not have the truth. That they must be told, as Peter did so and which is recorded at Acts 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many religious people who have zeal to build up their organization, but they do not understand the truth or the Lord’s righteous Government. Rather, they are trying to establish their own schemes; and thus they remain in bondage. They cling to an organization of man, believing that will save them. When Christ Jesus was upon the earth he joined up with no organization, not even with the scribes and Pharisees, the priests of his day; but he kept separate from religion and the world, and thus remained a free man. He maintained the free worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus today, the remnant, and the “other sheep”, are free people because they hold to the truth; and it is the truth that has made them free. They have full faith in God’s Word and trust in Him to guide and direct them in the proper path. They lean on no earthly organization built up by men. Being Jehovah’s witnesses they know the need of dispensing knowledge to the peoples of all nations, kindreds and tongues. Every effort is put forth by them to inform people freely of the truth contained in the Word of God, so that they may repent, change their course of action, and walk in the way of life. Their problem is the same as Paul’s; and they know that “whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report ? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”.—Rom. 10:13-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle’s argument here is that a person must hear the truth; but how can he hear if someone is not sent to him, so that he might hear, whether he be Jew or Greek, heathen or religionist ? How can the peoples of the world be made free, if they have not heard the truth that shall make them free ? It is necessary, therefore, to send forth a preacher; not one, but thousands, in all the world to give the witness. This is the work that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing in the earth today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Clearly do Jehovah’s witnesses see that the gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world for a witness; and that the truth is God’s Word, and the greatest textbook ever given to man is the Bible. It is the information contained therein, the knowledge of God’s Word, that is essential for all creatures to obtain. By the Lord’s grace, and under the direction of His great universal organization, Jehovah’s witnesses now go forth unto all parts of the world to proclaim the message of the Kingdom; for they know that knowledge is essential, and with knowledge of God’s Word the people shall be free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wise man says, “The lips of the wise disperse knowledge.” (Prov. 15:7) Again, he stated that “a wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increas-eth strength”. (Prov. 24:5) Knowledge of God’s Word is finer than choice gold. Wisdom and instruction are something to be desired by all creatures. The world of mankind has been held in darkness. Darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people. However, among all these people there are many who love righteousness, many who are of good-will, and the light of God’s Word is sown for these righteous ones. Jehovah’s witnesses have the obligation to “disperse knowledge” and go into all the world to teach and preach, even as the Lord Jesus commanded: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.” This work Jehovah’s witnesses have been carrying on against great opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the past decade the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has been banned in many countries. However, these ministers of the gospel did not stop preaching the message of the Kingdom; they continued, because they are a free people, representing a new Government of righteousness, and obligated to preach because of a covenant made with Jehovah by them. Their God has made them free to proclaim the message of the truth and to worship Him according to his Word. Government officials, religionists, gangsters or mobs might kill a creature, or a group of witnesses, but they can never silence the truth. God will raise up others to see that the message of truth is proclaimed. He declared that the very stones would cry out the message of the Kingdom if the servants of God failed to do this. But God’s servants are anxious and willing, and delight to sing forth his praises at the present time, and will continue to do so despite all persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect or a cult, opposed to present governments; nor are they fanatics who have some peculiar ideas about government, and who want to force them upon other people. Jehovah’s witnesses are just plain, ordinary people from every walk of life. They have one thing in common, and that is their love for truth and righteousness; and they have faith in Jehovah God and his Kingdom. Their belief and acceptance of the Son, Christ Jesus, as King of the New World cannot be shaken. Their will to follow in his footsteps cannot be changed. Their guide is God’s Word, the Bible, and in it is expressed the will of God concerning them. It is from there that they receive their instruction, and they follow the commands of the Almighty. Jehovah’s witnesses will obey all laws of men and nations if these are in full accord with Jehovah’s Word, as set out in the Holy Scriptures. Because they preach the Word of God, and this alone, they are persecuted, browbeaten, jailed, tortured, and even killed. All manner of evil is brought to bear against them. They do not shun these sufferings and persecutions, because they know that their Master, Christ Jesus, had to go through the same kind of suffering; and ‘the servant is no greater than the master’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not located in only one locality or country, but are to be found world-wide. Jehovah has had on earth since the time of Abel some men before the Flood and thousands since the Flood who have represented Him. These have maintained their integrity, and always proclaimed His truths to the people of their time. Jehovah’s witnesses at all times, past and present, have been a free people because of their knowledge of God and their obedience to the truth which has made them free; and as long as they hold to the truth they will be free. “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world,” said Jesus concerning his servants.—John 17:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The remnant on earth, who represent the free nation, having been brought together into one group or operating body to worship God, must remain that way. The reason they have been brought together is that Jehovah “draws them”. “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.” (John 6:44) What is it that draws or attracts the creature? The truth!! Jehovah’s witnesses are brought together unto Christ Jesus by God’s truth; for the truth will draw all righteous ones to the right place. “Light is sown for the righteous.” (Ps. 97:11) No one cometh to the Father, except by Christ Jesus, because Christ Jesus is the way, and the truth, and the life. Jehovah’s witnesses therefore recognize no man as leader; but Christ Jesus is the King, set upon his throne by the Father in heaven, and it is the King that they follow in service and in proclamation of the final warning to be given at this time, prior to Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>MANNER OF PREACHING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Primarily Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their work as did Christ Jesus when he was upon the earth, that is, from house to house. After the Lord had made his consecration to serve his Father in heaven he devoted all his time to preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, presenting the truth to the people, which would make them free from the bondage of this evil world. Due to the modern means of conveying information to other persons, Jehovah’s witnesses have advantages that Christ Jesus and the apostles did not have in their day. The printed page has been a real asset and is used very extensively by the Lord’s servants in their activity. These Christian people use Bibles, books, booklets, magazines, pamphlets, tracts, and other documents necessary to convey the truth of God’s Word to the people, in all principal languages. Jehovah’s witnesses are not book distributors, but are educators, and their purpose is to teach other people the same as Jesus did. In order that the people may get the very best out of the publications placed with them, Jehovah’s witnesses arrange to call back on these interested persons so that studies may be started in their homes. This work is identical with that done by Christ Jesus and the apostles, and it is carried on for the very purpose of teaching all persons the truth, which truth will lead to life eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work is not a selfish one, but is done solely in the interests of the people of good-will. Realizing the great need for free education among the people who love righteousness, these Christians press on, proclaiming the gospel of the Kingdom even though opposed by the leaders of this world, particularly the religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of Jehovah’s witnesses who have made a careful study of the Lord’s Word are qualified to teach and conduct studies of the Bible in the homes of the people. Being ordained ministers, and having consecrated their lives to serve the Almighty God, and receiving their ordination from Jehovah, as set forth at Isaiah 61:1, 2, they must of necessity do this work of preaching. They arrange for all the home Bible-study meetings that they can take care of. Yes, this takes time and energy, and great patience; but, with the aid of the books and question booklets provided, and various versions of the Bible, this work is making great progress and is receiving the Lord’s rich blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other instruments are used to convey the truth to the people, such as phonograph recordings. These lectures are reproduced by electrical transcription machines, radio, and portable phonograph. In fact, any means that will convey thought or ideas to the downtrodden peoples of the earth Jehovah’s witnesses use, so that the people may be enlightened and then follow in the proper way that leads to life and away from the bondage and regimentation of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font5"> brings to the attention of its readers the work that has been accomplished by these servants of the Lord as reported by their legal agents, the various corporations or branches that Jehovah’s witnesses use in different lands. This report will be of real interest to all the servants of the Most High and those who are seeking after truth and righteousness. You will see here a people separate from the world (though in it), who are unselfishly devoting their time, energy, money and strength in the interests of the people of good-will. At the same time you will see the greatest opposition brought against these people by the rulers, and those that set themselves in high places, particularly the religionists and their dupes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom in all the world for a witness is well organized and directed through two corporations (Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, of Pennsylvania; and Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., of New York) from their principal offices used by Jehovah’s witnesses. These offices are located in New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The corporate body owning the property where these offices are operating is known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., formerly Peoples Pulpit Association. This corporation was organized in the State of New York in 1909. Its charter provides, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The purposes for which it is to be formed are, the moral and mental improvement of men and women, the dissemination of Bible Truths in various languages by means of the publication of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and by the use of all other lawful means which its board of directors, duly constituted, shall deem expedient for the purposes stated, and for religious missionary work . . . “its corporate purposes are, Charitable, benevolent, scientific, historical, literary and Religious purposes, and for the purpose of maintaining and conducting classes for the gratuitous Instruction of men and women, on the premises or by mail, in the Bible, Bible literature and Bible history, and for the gratuitous teaching, training and preparing of men and women as teachers, and as lecturers on the Bible and preachers of the Gospel, and to provide and maintain a home, place, building or buildings for the gratuitous housing, sheltering and boarding of such students, lecturers, teachers and ministers, and to gratuitously furnish to such students, lecturers, teachers and ministers suitable meals and lodging, and to prepare, support, maintain and send out to the various parts of the world religious missionaries, teachers and instructors in the Bible and Bible literature, and for public religious worship, and for the purpose of the publication and distribution of Bibles and Bible and religious literature . . . The operation of a radio broadcasting station ... to carry out the present purposes and powers of the corporation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president’s office and the office of the secretarytreasurer, and one of the Society’s homes for “gratuitous teaching, training and preparing of men and women as teachers ... on the Bible and . . . gratuitous housing, sheltering and boarding of such students”, are located at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, N. Y. The general offices of this corporation, and its printing plant, are located at 117 Adams Street. It is from this place that all its magazines, books and tracts are shipped. Its college, which does “maintain and send out to various parts of the world . . . missionaries, teachers and instructors in the Bible and Bible literature”, is located at South Lansing, New York state. Its broadcasting station is located on Staten Island, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York corporation, known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., is not the subsidiary of any legal corporation, but is an agent used by Jehovah’s witnesses to carry on the work of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, primarily in New York state and, generally, throughout all of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For Jehovah’s witnesses the New York corporation prints Bibles, magazines, books, booklets, tracts; it has manufactured phonographs, records, and does generally all the work and business necessary as a corporation and for Jehovah’s witnesses. It purchases all materials for printing and publishing of literature. It makes shipments to all companies, pioneers and others desiring the Society’s literature. This corporation sends out servants to the brethren (these being traveling ordained ministers) throughout the country to aid in the organization of the companies and to assist generally Jehovah’s witnesses in advancing the preaching of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The contributions that Jehovah’s witnesses receive in their house-to-house work for literature distributed are sent to the New York corporation so that this corporation can print more of such literature for other persons of good-will; but these contributions do not cover all the cost of operating the Society. The difference is made up each year by donations to the Society by Jehovah’s witnesses. The New York corporation is a non-profit organization and was organized in 1909 to carry on its benevolent purposes and charitable work, and has done so since that date; and all of the funds it receives are used to this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It maintains a home at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, N. Y. This home houses all the workers that take care of the corporation’s activities in the city of New York. The men and women living at 124 Columbia Heights, known as the Bethel home, all being Jehovah’s witnesses and ordained ministers, have volunteered their services freely to aid in the advancing of the Kingdom interests. All, including the officers and directors, receive the same allowance each month, namely, $10, for clothing and incidental expenses. All other things are provided for them, such as room and board. No officer or director receives any profit from the operation of the Society, and their services are voluntarily contributed to the cause of preaching the gospel. Some of them work at the Bethel home; others in the printing plant, located at 117 Adams Street, where the manufacture of books, booklets and magazines is carried on, and shipment of the same made. Many also spend their time in' the office, taking care of the correspondence and work necessary in the organization and activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. The use of the properties owned by the Society is exclusively for chartered purposes and for the carrying on of its philanthropic work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York corporation also has property on Staten Island where is located the radio station, WBBR, which broadcasts no commercial announcements, no money ever being received by this station for programs broadcast. Its sole purpose for existence is the preaching of the gospel, that is, in the public interest, convenience and necessity, which is benevolent. On this same location at Staten Island there is a truck garden. The food raised at this place is immediately used on the table of the Bethel home, or is canned for use in the winter. No products raised on this farm are sold to anyone, but are used by the corporation exclusively for the care of the family at Bethel. No one profits from the operation of this farm, but the food produced therefrom enables the Society to operate the Bethel home at a much smaller cost than it would require if all food were bought from outside producers or dealers. Thus the greatest amount of work can be done at the lowest cost and thus more money can be used in directly preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom among the poor and people of goodwill. All persons performing services to produce the food are members of the Bethel family and they receive no profit for producing the same. Each is a minister of the gospel and does ministerial work, as does every member of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The charter of the New York corporation provides that it may establish schools for ministers, missionaries, traveling evangelists and teachers. To this end the New York corporation has established the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, at South Lansing, N. Y., where further training in Bible study is given to ordained ministers brought in from all parts of the United States. At this same location it maintains a farm that provides food for the college and Bethel home, and which is not operated in any way for pecuniary gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of this corporation carried on at any of its properties is wholly educational, benevolent, nonprofit, and its activities are in the interests of all persons of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York corporation, being one of the legal agents used by Jehovah’s witnesses, would naturally work in co-opcration and full accord with other corporations established by Jehovah’s witnesses, carrying out a like purpose. To this end the New York corporation co-operates fully with the Pennsylvania corporation and supplies this corporation with all literature needed in its work of further spreading the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pennsylvania corporation, known as the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, was formed in 1884. This corporation was the first organization or legal agent used by Jehovah’s witnesses, and it sets the general policy and plans for the world-wide work of Jehovah’s witnesses, which work it carries on. The Pennsylvania corporation operates in the State of Pennsylvania and has the right to direct preaching activity of its ministers in other states. It has a &quot;registered” office located in Pennsylvania. It also has established branches of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society (Pennsylvania corporation) in all parts of the world and sends to these other countries evangelists or missionaries to care for the work of preaching the gospel in these other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York corporation has an account with the Pennsylvania corporation and prints all the necessary publications that the Pennsylvania corporation uses in the foreign countries. The Pennsylvania corporation has no printing plant of its own in the United States. Therefore the New York corporation, also an agent of Jehovah’s witnesses, does such printing of books, booklets, magazines, etc., as is required by the Pennsylvania corporation. Both corporations are doing the same work, but in different localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Pennsylvania corporation was originally established, in 1884, whatever printing was necessary to be done was contracted for with commercial concerns. In 1909 it was found that the work generally could be carried on better from New York city on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses, and therefore the main offices and operating headquarters were moved to Brooklyn, and the Peoples Pulpit Association, now the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., was organized. Eventually the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., established its own printing plant. Their purposes being parallel, and both being agents of Jehovah’s witnesses, it is only natural now that this New York corporation should be printing supplies required by the Pennsylvania corporation, all of which is done at no profit to the New York corporation or the Pennsylvania corporation. The Pennsylvania corporation still operates in Pennsylvania and has its home and registered office in Pittsburgh, Allegheny county. Because the president of the New York corporation and the president of the Pennsylvania corporation are the same individual, and for convenience of its officers, and for other reasons, it uses offices at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, N. Y., to direct its corporate activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pennsylvania corporation, operating branches in foreign lands, has in several instances set up its own printing plants in other countries. In some countries where branches operated it was found necessary to establish a local corporation to take care of the operation of property and to care for certain legal matters within that country. To this end the International Bible Students Association was organized, in 1914, at London, England, and is another legal agent used by Jehovah’s witnesses to further the interests of the Kingdom. A corporation by the same name (International Bible Students Association, Ltd.) was organized in Canada, it being part of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These legal agents—the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society (Pennsylvania), the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. (New York), the International Bible Students Association (United Kingdom), and any other “agents”—all do the same work and are organized for the same purpose, and are used by Jehovah’s witnesses in whatever locality they are legally recognized to further advance their activities of preaching and teaching God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because the principal officers of all three corporations are practically the same in identity, especially as to the office of president, the president has an office in New York and from that place directs the affairs of all three corporations, the Pennsylvania, the New York, and the British corporation. All corporations are, however, separate and distinct one from the other and were organized legally at different times and at different places, but all for the purpose of increasing the interests of the Kingdom and advancing the witness work. Each corporation has its separate set of books and records. Each corporation has its own board of directors and each board of directors holds regular meetings to decide the business necessary in connection with that particular corporation. Sometimes there are joint meetings of the boards of directors, because the policies affecting one corporation would of necessity affect the others; for all the corporations are agents for Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah’s witnesses in themselves are not a corporate body, nor can they as such own or operate factories, homes or any kind of institution and thus carry on a legal business under the name “Jehovah’s witnesses”. It is clearly to be seen then that, while Jehovah’s witnesses’ work is a worldwide activity of preaching God’s Word, they must use certain agents or corporations so that they can, as far as this world is concerned, have legal recognition in the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom. They have full right, because Jehovah God has given them that right, to proclaim the message of the Kingdom throughout all the world. But, so that they might carry on their business legally and according to the laws of the various lands, they have organized corporations for convenience and effective operation. No corporations are ever formed by Jehovah’s witnesses in any state or country unless it is found to be expedient, and then only with the consent of the president of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pennsylvania and New York corporations above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Summing up the matter, then, Jehovah’s witnesses are now using the Pennsylvania corporation, namely, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, to carry on its chartered work in the State of Pennsylvania and the United States, as well as to operate branches throughout all the world. The literature this corporation uses it obtains from a New York corporation of a similar name. In some foreign lands it has established its own printing plants to further its chartered purposes. Contributions by people throughout all the world are made to the Pennsylvania corporation to enable it to carry on its work. This includes wills and estates left to “Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society”, a Pennsylvania corporation. The monies it receives by this means go into a “Good Hopes” fund and, at the direction of the board of directors of this corporation, are expended for the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom in any part of the world that it seems advisable and in the best interests of the people of goodwill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York corporation was organized in 1909 for the purpose of carrying on the work in New York state, when it took on the primary responsibility for the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the United States. This corporation could, if it so desired, establish branches throughout all the world ; but, since this work has already been done by the Pennsylvania corporation, there is no need for such a step, and therefore these activities are still handled by the Pennsylvania corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses might be carried on efficiently, these various corporations have been formed in such places as deemed necessary and thus the work has been carried on systematically, orderly and to comply with proper state and governmental laws or regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the corporations are non-profit, benevolent, educational, Christian, and philanthropic organizations. None of the officers receive any pecuniary gain, but they serve because they have consecrated their lives to this benevolent work. Monies received by Jehovah’s witnesses in the distribution of literature are returned to the New York corporation, or, in other countries, to the branches of the Pennsylvania corporation, and this makes possible further publication of books, magazines and printed matter. “Good Hopes” contributions sent to the Pennsylvania corporation are used for missionary service in the United States, or any other nation or field where funds are required. All monies expended are spent at the direction of the officers of the corporation controlling these funds, who act as trustees and stewards of Almighty God and always in the best interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>ORDAINED MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Any individual of sound mind and mature in years, who has a knowledge of God’s Word and appreciates His commands, and who then makes a full consecration unto God to do His will, is ordained of God to be His servant, for ever, if he maintains his eovenant. When Christ Jesus was upon the earth he consecrated his life to the service of his Father in heaven, and he symbolized his consecration by water baptism in the river Jordan. All his apostles followed the same course. Everyone who properly claims to be a Christian or one of Jehovah’s witnesses now will do likewise. One who has consecrated his life to the service of the Most High will preach the gospel of the Kingdom as he has opportunity, and really puts forth every effort to do that. One does not go to a theological seminary or school to be an ordained minister of the gospel. To go there would mean that he was ordained of men to preach God’s Word; whereas the only One who can give the real authority to preach the Word of God is Jehovah himself, even as He gave it unto his Son. (Isa. 61:1,2) One having consecrated himself and having received the ordination from Jehovah God will put forth every effort possible to preach the gospel of the Kingdom by going from house to house visiting the people of good-will, comforting those that mourn, calling back on the interested persons and conducting book studies to show them the importance of God’s Word and why one must follow its instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout all the world, where there are a large number or a few of Jehovah’s witnesses located in one city or town, they assemble together for the study of God’s Word. These recognize The Theocracy, God’s Government, and request the Society to appoint a servant who will direct the general affairs of the local organization, so that they may get on at unity. This servant is known as a company servant. He does not receive his position by election of those in the company, but, because of his good works and ability, and willingness to serve his brethren, is appointed by the head office or branch office of one of the corporations. These corporations are the servants of all of Jehovah’s witnesses, and those in responsible positions of the corporations look well to the interests of the Kingdom everywhere. Those brethren appointed as company servants, or as any other servant in the company, must first be wholly devoted to the Lord and must show that they will assume the responsibilities placed upon them as a servant. While all of Jehovah’s witnesses are ministers of the gospel and receive their ordination from Jehovah, these appointed servants hold special positions of responsibility among their congregations, to lead in the work of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom and conducting studies, and to arrange the assembling together of Jehovah’s witnesses for worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to these servants of congregations, the Society has thousands of evangelists or missionaries who travel from place to place in territories where there are no organizations of Jehovah’s witnesses. These brethren are known as pioneer publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then there are other servants specially appointed to represent the Society, such as servants to the brethren. These are traveling evangelists or ministers who go from company to company for the purpose of aiding them in clearly seeing their privileges as Jehovah’s witnesses. Others are special evangelists or missionaries in foreign fields. Others are selected to work at institutions of the Society, such as the Bethel home, Society’s college, or at branches. This special list of servants, all ordained ministers, the Society publishes in its </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> But this list by no means represents all the ordained ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>WATCHTOWER BIBLE COLLEGE OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing the great need of carrying the message of the Kingdom into many other lands by brethren properly equipped to serve, it was deemed advisable, after prayerful and careful consideration, to open up a college. This college is called the “Watchtower Bible College of Gilead”, and is located at South Lansing, New York. The course of training was carefully laid out. The only ones eligible to attend the college were to be ordained, Theocratic ministers, that is, persons who have already proved their devotion to the Lord, and have shown that they are wholly desirous of fulfilling their commission to be witnesses of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The instructors for the college were selected many months before the college opened, and the general outline of the course was laid before them; and these instructors worked out the details of the course so that a full five months’ study on Bible subjects and other necessary material might be considered, for better fitting these ministers for service in missionary fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society had already constructed a beautiful building called “Gilead”. Some changes were necessary, such as putting in classrooms, preparing a library, gathering the essential textbooks, and making ample provision for the care of the 100 students who were invited to attend the first college term. By Sunday, January 31, 1943, every one of the hundred students invited to come to the college (51 brothers and 49 sisters) had registered at the college registrar’s office. These students had come from all parts of the United States. On Monday morning, February 1, at 8 o’clock, before an audience of 160, the historic dedication service of the college began. It was a plain, but impressive dedicatory program, including an address by the president and by members of the board of directors of the Society. At ten o’clock all classes were started, and the first day was spent in acquainting the students with the outline of each of the eight courses and issuing to them the required textbooks and supplies. From that day forward the college schedule of seven daily school periods of forty minutes each, and three hours in the afternoon devoted to domestic duties and farm service, for diversion, was executed unto the completion of the twenty weeks of this first college term. Saturdays and Sundays were occupied in study and applied missionary service in the field, within a radius of thirty miles of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, here in the quiet of Gilead, far from the noise and din of this dying, war-torn old world, the first college year opened, to the praise of Jehovah’s glorious name. The student body and instructors were privileged to gather together beside the still waters of truth of the Watchtower Bible College, to rehearse many of the righteous acts of our God, even his righteous acts toward his devoted servants in present-day Israel. The text at Judges 5:11 (A.B.F.) sets out beautiful and appropriate words: “Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, even the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being a Bible college, the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead has as its principal textbook the Bible, which itself is a library of sixty-six books. A good library is a basic and fundamental need of an institution of higher learning. The college library contains 1,400 volumes of reputed, authentic works. It contains 87 various versions, translations and recensions of the Holy Scriptures extant. In addition to having a full complement of all the Society’s publications of the past seventy years, the library contains the standard works and classics of many of the leading authorities of the United States, England, Scotland, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere. It is possible to make a fairly exhaustive study of any particular Bible doctrine, theme or topic, whatever may be the object of the research by any student or instructor. Every facility and means is offered at the college to enable the Theocratic minister to become better equipped and fitted for his ministerial service of the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Briefly, the subjects studied at the Watchtower Bible College are these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bible Research : This course is devoted to both an interpretative and a non-interpretative study of the Bible. First, a topical and comparative study is made of the internal history of the Bible. Then its external history is examined, as to its origin, its growth, its transmission and miraculous preservation, both of the Bible itself as a book and of its textual integrity. A study is made of the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts, extant, ancient and modern versions, and of the various recensions. An analysis is made of each of the sixty-six books comprising the Holy Scriptures, as to their meaning, origin, title, author and writer, principal contents, very essence, literary form of composition, authenticity, and canonicity. To complete this course, the student must read and study the entire Bible as part of his homework. Any student entering Gilead would do well to read the entire Bible carefully before starting the course. He should be well versed in the past few years’ issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and in recent books published by the Society. Thus the student will profit greatly, and will save much time while at the college.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocratic Field Ministry: This course is devoted to the study of the Christian ministry. The first two weeks of this course are spent in a study of the history and origin of religion, tracing such from its very fountainhead in Babylon of Nimrod’s time. It takes in the principal religions of today, pagan and so-called “Christian”. It also examines the origin and operation of the various “Christian” sects. Some time is spent in considering the fifteen centuries of the history of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its rule by inquisition, the Reformation, and the present-day activity of religion. A very careful study is then made of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ and his apostles, ordination, commission, methods of preaching, and the ministerial duties in general. Theocratic forms of church government, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> are taken up, together with counsel on the conducting and organizing of home and group Bible studies. A series of lectures were delivered on the history of the Society from 1870 onward. Much consideration is given to the matter of educating persons of good-will in the field in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Public Bible Speaking : Here the student is taught how to glorify Jehovah’s name through impressive, faith-inspiring communication of his message of the gospel, in order to stir listeners to action, that is, to works of faith. The students are trained in the most effective manner of public speaking or preaching, namely, enlarged or intensified conversation, which combines the friendly intimacy and directness of address with the enthusiasm, power, range and dignity required when addressing more hearers. The students are trained to use all effective methods of delivery best suited to various occasions. They learn how to overcome self-consciousness and audience fear, and to speak in the strength of the Lord, with poise under difficult conditions. Attention is given to proper volume, clear articulation, and how to convince the listener by Scriptural, orderly and effective argument. Speaking before audiences and before microphones is part of the course. Their voices are recorded from time to time and these recordings are used in giving proper training in this course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Supreme Law : This study is one of great interest to the students. The primary purpose is the study of the majestic </span><span class="font4">law of God; hence its title “Supreme Law”. The first several weeks are devoted wholly to Theocratic law as set forth in the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, as presented by Moses, Christ Jesus and the apostles, and all other inspired men of God who wrote the Bible. The student is taught that the Theocratic law is absolute in its supremacy, and is unlimited in its scope. After making a very careful study of the laws of God, the course merges into the law of man under the two major legal systems, namely, the Anglo-American Law and the Roman Civil Law. Lectures and classroom studies deal with legal subjects, such as civil and criminal law, court procedure, property, corporations, legal forms and instruments, and international rights and privileges. The Constitution of the United States and its guarantees of freedom of worship are fully studied. Many of the Supreme Court decisions relative to Jehovah’s witnesses are considered in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">College English : A brief review of grammar is given, and the rest of the course is devoted to oral reading of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font4"> and to writing of compositions on Biblical subjects. Due consideration is given to spelling and proper handwriting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">College Spanish : The purpose of this course is to give the student a general knowledge of Spanish grammar and pronunciation, and a basic vocabulary adapted to the needs of a minister of Jehovah God. The aim is to give the student the ability to understand, speak, read, and write enough Spanish to get along when he gets into some Spanish territory. Thus he has the basis on which to build his further knowledge of the Spanish language. This course will be most helpful to those going to Latin-American countries. In the classroom the students read in Spanish, write in Spanish, and speak in Spanish on Theocratic matters, such as witnessing, answering objections, conducting Bible studies and discussing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">College Arithmetic : The object of this course is to give the student an accurate conception and understanding of Biblical mathematics, and an understanding of modern values and measurements. A thorough training is given in fractions, decimals, percentage, and average. Elementary </span><span class="font4">bookkeeping and accounting are studied. A list of general business terms is defined and discussed. Ilie course includes lectures and studies on the subjects of money, banking, foreign exchange, interest, weights and measures, the metric system, domestic and foreign commerce, and of shipping documents, including consular invoices and Society forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bible Themes : This course has been designed to be put in operation during the second college term, and some of the subjects were briefly dealt with during the first college term. It is an interpretative study of the leading doctrines as taught in the Scriptures, and as championed by Jehovah’s witnesses in their ministerial service. This is a most interesting study, taking up many Bible themes. A few are as follows: “Jehovah,” “Jesus,” “Jehovah’s Organization,” “End of the World,” “The Kingdom,” “Vindication,” “The Ransom,” “Redemption,” “Covenants,” “Memorial,” “The Body of Christ,” “Holy Spirit,” “Prayer,” “Suffering as a Christian,” “Wickedness,” “Resurrection,” “Great Multitude,” “Christian Conduct,” “Love,” “Knowledge and Wisdom”; and there are many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The subjects included in the curriculum at the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead are covered thoroughly. When the student leaves the college he is well prepared to discuss these subjects with anyone and present the truth in much better fashion than would be possible without this course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the first college class of one hundred students, only six were dropped during the period of the course; and, of the ninety-four students that remained, eighty-four qualified to graduate with merit and received diplomas. Gilead’s first graduation was held on June 23, 1943, and for a full report see the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine. Herewith are set out the names of all the students of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead that received diplomas; and, if it be the Lord’s will, these will be sent to various parts of the earth to carry on their evangelistic work. Some of these students have already gone to other countries to carry on in the free education of the men of good-will.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Bethel (the name means “house of God”) has always been looked to by Jehovah’s witnesses as the chief center of the Lord’s work on earth. Here it is that the general direction of the Lord’s work world-wide takes place. It is at the Bethel home, too, where many of God’s free men and women serve him day and night, with joy and gladness. The Bethel family is entirely free from all worldly cares, and all members of that family devote their full time to The Theocracy, and are privileged to make full use of the munificent provisions of the Bethel home, which, through the spirit of Jehovah upon his people therein, is truly wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only do those at the Bethel home, which is situated at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y., have the privilege of serving their brethren throughout the earth in the manufacture of books, magazines, etc., and in answering correspondence, and in taking care of the needs of the brethren living here; but, above all, they have the rich blessing of the Lord upon their service. Without the spirit of the Lord, and his blessing upon their activity, the work that is done at this place could never be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the numerous spiritual blessings which all enjoy, comment must be made on the temporal blessings. To this end the Society has arranged to have under its ownership and operation several farms that provide for all of our needs in the way of food—fresh vegetables, eggs, fowl, and meat. So that those living at the Bethel home itself may continue on in their work, other institutions are in operation that directly support the Bethel home. All of the members working at these other places, which in general are farms, such as Watchtower, Staten Island; Mountain Farm, New Jersey; Kingdom Farm, New York; and Beth-Sarim, California, contribute to the welfare of the Bethel family, and all the faithful servants of the Lord working at these different institutions are considered part of the Bethel family. There are approximately 292 persons working in various institutions that the Society operates directly throughout the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Watchtower, Staten Island, is situated the broadcasting equipment which broadcasts the message of station WBBR. On this same property we have a large vegetable garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mountain Farm is located not far from Bethel, where other vegetables are grown for the provision of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kingdom Farm is an establishment of some sixteen hundred acres. Here the bulk of the food is raised, and is trucked to the Bethel home in New York city. This location also houses the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead. The farm servant says: “The opening of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, February 1,1943, was a memorable day and the greatest event that has come to Kingdom Farm. The name and work of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead has spread far and wide and has been a great blessing to us here at the farm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other institutions operated by the Society are several depots throughout the country. These come under the direct supervision of the office at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn. A detailed report concerning the activities of the factory will be given a little later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At these various institutions all the brethren are given opportunity to engage in the field service, in addition to performing their regular duties day by day. Fully appreciating that the great work of the free people on the earth is that of being publishers, all members of the Bethel family and those living in Society institutions, no matter where they are, put forth a diligent effort to spend their week-ends and any spare time they have in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To better fit them for this service work, each institution has its own </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study among the brethren living there, as well as the advanced course in Theocratic ministry. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and the advanced course in Theocratic ministry have been a great aid to each one, and all appreciate the spiritual blessings that the Lord is continually showering upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every one in these institutions esteems it a great privilege to work diligently at his assignment and perform his work as unto the Lord, and to get on in unity with others. All appreciate, too, the great work that is yet to be done in the education of men of goodwill. While definite hours are set for each day of service, often many put in extra time to get special work accomplished. None of the brethren ever hesitate to put in extra hours when they know it is required, so that those in the field may be supplied with the necessary publications to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only purpose of these various institutions is to aid the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom. Every one serving in these institutions appreciates that his work is a small part of the great work that Jehovah God is accomplishing in the earth, namely, having this gospel of the Kingdom preached in all the world for a witness. While some milk cows, some feed chickens, and others make beds and prepare meals, this all reflects itself in the production of Kingdom literature at the factory located at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y., and aids the publishers in the field doing the great work of bringing comfort to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses always has been and always will be to magnify and honor the Lord’s name, and to aid those people who love righteousness to get a knowledge of the truth. These institutions must operate at the lowest possible cost so that Bibles, magazines, books and booklets can be printed in large quantities and distributed world-wide, in all languages. The publishers who actually do the distributing and witnessing work receive only small contributions for the literature. Jehovah’s witnesses believe in the principle “Freely ye have received, freely give”. (Matt. 10:8) While the greater part of the witnessing is done by the special pioneer publishers, pioneers, and company publishers, all of the persons working in the various institutions also have a share in it, because they too are publishers at week-ends and in evenings, as well as being the providers of the supplies. Every one living at the Society’s institutions is a member of some company or unit in the locality of the institution, and co-operates with the company publishers and pioneers in whatever area they live, to advance the Kingdom interests and to carry on freely the great educational campaign for the people of goodwill.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is only by the Lord’s grace that the factory was able to produce during the past year as much printed literature as it did, in view of the many shortages of supplies for bookmaking. There has been a constant shortage of paper, and, as announced in the public press, all printing plants were cut at least ten percent in their use of certain supplies. This reflected to some extent upon the production of the printing plant during the service year. It is observed from the year’s report that we used 182 tons less of paper during this year than we did in the previous year. If more paper could have been obtained, it eould easily have been used, because of the demand in the field. Even with shortages in supplies, the factory was kept going full-time throughout the year, with a larger force than heretofore. This increased force was required mainly in the office, because of the greater amount of work to be done there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Outstanding in the last year was the production of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font5"> which was printed to the amount of 2,023,650 copies. Hundreds of thousands more copies could have been used in the field if it had been possible to get paper to print them. Much time during the year was taken up in the publishing of Bibles. It takes considerably more time to publish a Bible than it does to produce a book, and while wc did not have as much paper as in previous years, the time required and the work put in on a Bible are together far greater in comparison with the amount of paper used. The large production of Bibles this year, compared with that of former years, is another reason that our factory kept so busy this year. During the service year 1943 there were produced 222,000 Bibles, nearly 12,000 of these being the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span><span class="font5"> The demand for Bibles is unprecedented, and we are far behind in the filling of orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the shortage of paper, the 32-page booklets were stressed, principally </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front.</span><span class="font5"> In the booklet field, upward of 25,000,000 copies were printed. This includes the question booklet for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World </span><span class="font5">and the one for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Near the close of the year the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font5"> was released, and we were able to get ready 151,488 copies for the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a while we were not able to procure as much paper for magazines as we should have liked; however, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazines were printed to the amount of 16,228,693.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So it is observed that in 1943 there was a decrease in the number of bound books and magazines printed, but there was an increase in booklets. This, however, was due to the booklets’ being smaller, namely, 32 pages rather than 64.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the main publications the Society prints, namely, Bibles, and books and booklets explaining the Bible, the factory also produced millions of tracts for distribution throughout the land. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> reached the high total of 21,000,000. Calendars, placards, bookmarks, and miscellaneous printing were also produced in large quantities, but not sufficiently large to meet the demands all the way round. For the first time in many years it was necessary for the Society to let out some of its printing, and this was done, particularly at the convention time. It was necessary to have many placards, handbills and other supplies printed for the hundred convention cities throughout the United States. It was impossible for the Society to get the paper so as to do its own printing, so these jobs were let out to other printers. The cost, of course, was much greater; but the need for advertising was essential and the preaching of the gospel must go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A detailed comparative report of the production at 117 Adams Street for 1943 and 1942 is set out below:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All the above printing was in the English language, with the exception of a fair quantity of books and booklets printed in the Spanish language, and a few in Portuguese. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> was published as usual in foreign languages. But, as far as books and booklets are concerned, they were printed only in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. This is most unusual, but it shows how the war has interfered with the shipping of the message of truth to many foreign lands, as was done heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The material used to produce the above-listed publications was very great. It required 2,603 tons of paper, of all kinds, 145 tons of chipboard, 234,990 yards of cloth. The factory at Adams Street continued to manufacture its own inks, paint, putty, glue, paste, and other materials required in the manufacturing of books. It may be that in the coming year shortages in some lines will be greater. It now appears that it will be impossible to obtain cloth for all of our publications, and that is the reason for binding this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> with paper, it being impossible to purchase any kind of cloth from manufacturers. What the future will be, we do not know; but, by the Lord’s grace, we shall continue to print books and get them into the hands of the people so that the campaign of free education can continue.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>SHIPMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society had on hand at its factory at Adams Street and at depots throughout the country a fair supply of literature when the year began, but the shipments during 1943 cut into that reserve supply considerably. The shipment of books and booklets exceeded the manufacturing by many millions of copies, and exceeded last year’s shipping total by almost 9,000,000 books and booklets. During 1942 we shipped out from the Brooklyn office and depots throughout the United States 20,800,000 books and booklets in the English and foreign languages; but in 1943 we shipped out 29,800,000. Not only did this cut into the great reserve the Society had stored up, but also cut into much of the company reserve, which was distributed during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the outstanding points to take into consideration as far as shipments are concerned are these: Out of the 28,693,601 English books, booklets and Bibles shipped from 117 Adams Street, only 39,041 copies got out of the country. We should like to have shipped such literature to all parts of the Englishspeaking world, but in these days there is no space on ships for the literature containing the message of the truth. It was, however, possible to ship a considerable amount of Spanish and Portuguese literature (mostly Spanish), totaling 521,000 copies of books and booklets, to Cuba, Mexico and a few other Latin-American countries, the Mexican shipments being made by rail freight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The big demand during the year was for the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font5"> More than 2,000,000 copies of this were shipped out. The next highest total was that of Bibles, 225,000 being shipped. This is an increase, by 142,000 copies, in the number of Bibles shipped over that of last year. The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front</span><span class="font5"> surpassed anything else that we have ever been able to do as to the shipping of one publication in any one service year. There were 15,179,558 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front</span><span class="font5"> shipped out. The next-highest was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font5"> with 7,500,000 being shipped to all parts of the United States. In all, 26,803,000 copies of booklets in the English and foreign languages were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other regular shipping is that of the two magazines, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> These being dated publications, there is no reserve to draw from during the year. Due to the shortage of paper, we find a decrease in the shipping of these two magazines of approximately 1,200,000 copies. The total number of magazines shipped was 15,601,177. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is published in English, Greek, Italian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Ukrainian; while </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> is published in English, Greek, Spanish, and Ukrainian. The greater portion of all these publications were mailed to subscribers in the United States, with the exception of those in the Spanish language, which are also sent to the Latin-American countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cost of express, freight, parcel post, upkeep of the depots, and shipping supplies, amounted to $159,871.08.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A large number of recordings were sent out during the year, but nothing to compare with former years, because of the shortage of record-making material prevalent throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of this shipping naturally kept the office quite busy, as the shipping is dependent upon orders received through the mail. The office report shows that 324,250 letters came in to 117 Adams Street, and 322,800 were dispatched. This is an increase over the previous year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>SERVICE IN THE FIELD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is in the field where an individual can prove his integrity unto his Maker. One can say, ‘I have faith,’ but another will say, ‘Where is your faith without your works?’ The apostle James makes very clear that “faith without works is dead”. The works spoken of by the apostle James and by all of the apostles, and by Christ Jesus himself, are those works pertaining to the Kingdom. To engage in the work of God, which is that of proclaiming the message of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness, requires determination and endurance. Maintaining one’s integrity, which means the fulfilling of one’s consecration to Jehovah God, is not an easy matter. It takes patience, long-suffering and endurance to make the grade. A person can get along in the world with bluff and talk, and put on a “front” of being busy; but, with the Lord, lie is able to read the mind and the heart, and He judges one by his actual works. Those serving The Theocracy will bear much fruit, and it is what is brought forth from the vineyard that Jehovah God is interested in. He gave us many parables—the pounds, the talents, the vineyard, etc.—and all of them show that there is an increase when one properly cares for his work. The servant who buries in the earth his treasure or interests of the Kingdom can never bring back an increase. But he that goes out and works for his Master is the one that will reap results in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It appears that during the past year some have become so occupied with the affairs of this world that they were not able to put in time regularly in the field service for the New World. This is a decision that each one must make; but one who makes the wrong decision may fail entirely when it comes to everlasting life. Service in the field, being a publisher, is a requirement by the Lord. The field for service is the world; and, no matter where one is who has made a consecration to serve God, he can always proclaim the message to people round about him. The past year has been the most blessed year for those publishers of the Kingdom who have fought a good fight, and who have remained active in the service. At the close of the year, throughout the world, we find more publishers engaged in the field service, on the average per month, namely, 109,794, than in any previous year. The increase is not much; about 4,000 more publishers. We-know that associated with the companies there are many new faces, new publishers, and that these are the ones who have kept up this excellent average. Others have stepped aside for some reason; and it is hoped they will soon return. Was it because the Devil’s organization put on too much heat? Was it because of mob violence? Was it because of a position in some organization of a worldly concern that they have stepped aside ? We all know that thousands of good-will persons have been immersed during the past year, and that the majority of these new ones engage in the field service, many of them regularly. This, of necessity, means that some have dropped out, or stepped aside for a while. There are some, too, who, for one reason or another, have been taken away and restrained of their liberties until after the war. But this does not account for those who have slacked their hand. The faithful will receive Jehovah’s blessing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report set out in this year’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> is, for the most part, for an eleven-month period, from all countries, including the United States. The preparing of the report material for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> has been moved up a month, so that it may be possible to get it out earlier than heretofore, and, at the same time, give the far-distant countries opportunity to mail in their reports in time to be published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> Even with only eleven months being reported it is marvelous in our eyes, and shows Jehovah’s guidance in this great work of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>UNITED STATES FIELD SERVICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Comparing the eleven-month figures with those of the previous twelve-month year we find a definite increase in the distribution of books and booklets, and also in the number of publishers participating in the service regularly. There was a splendid increase in the number of new subscriptions taken during the year, and in the number of book studies and book-study attendance. There is, however, in the eleven-month period a slight drop in hours and back-calls. But, from all analyses, we feel sure that if this had been for a twelve-month period, upon comparing it with the same twelve months of last year it would have shown an increase in hours and back-calls just as the other figures in the report did. For some reason or other, during the early part of the service year of 1943, from October until March, the brethren seemed to have difficulty in meeting the Theocratic requirements. Each of these months, with the exception of February, ran behind the same months of the preceding year. However, when we reached April, the “Call to Action” Testimony Period, a change took place, and it was very evident that some had slacked their hand unwittingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the “Call to Action” Testimony Period, in April, a new all-time peak in publishers was reached, namely, 72,490 engaging in the field service in the United States. This is in itself a proof of the defeat of persecution. After several years of mob action, and having the finger of scorn pointed at them and all manner of ridicule brought to bear against them, Jehovah’s witnesses did not slow down when the “Call to Action” came, but they responded as one person. Since April the averages have been considerably higher, but it is hoped that all of the brethren will see their responsibilities, and not be entangled in the affairs of this world and go back to the bondage from which they have been freed. It is hoped that they will continue on regularly in the service, taking care of the greatest work that has ever been done on the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work accomplished in the field could have been done only with the Lord’s rich blessing and favor, and it is most interesting to observe that in eleven months more bound books and more booklets were placed than in the twelve months of last year’s report, bringing the total of literature distributed up to 21,604,472. This work was done by 62,762 regular publishers in the field. A detailed report of the field service is set out below:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>SPECIAL PIONEER PUBLISHERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The one privilege that every creature can have who has made a consecration to serve God is that of being a publisher, putting in time in the service and making back-calls on the people of good-will and starting book studies. Not everyone can put in the same amount of time or make the same number of back-calls, but everybody can serve God. The special pioneer publishers have the greatest privilege of service, because they are devoting more time to the field service than any other group of field servants in the earth today. The special pioneer publishers strive to put in 175 hours a month, and the greater portion of them do. The average for the 1,490 special pioneers engaging in the work last year was 159.4 hours every month. They made an average of 53.1 back-calls per publisher per month, and each of these 1,490 special pioneers, on the average, conducted 6 book studies per week. This little band of faithful publishers, representing only 2 percent of all the publishers in the United States, put in at least 15 percent of the hours that were devoted to field service throughout the country. The Lord blessed them in that they made 15 percent of the placements also, and they arranged for 20 percent of all the back-calls and conducted 17 percent of all the book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Their report for the year 1943 shows a definite increase in every branch of the field service over that of 1942, with the exception of the sound attendance. This is due in some degree to the shortage of records and the lack of repairs on phonographs. At the beginning of the year there were on the list of special pioneer publishers 1,578, and at the end of the year 1,572. During the year 335 were added, while 341 were transferred to the general pioneer list, or went off entirely. An individual’s being transferred to the general list is always due to the lack in number of hours and failure to meet the requirements of the special pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is from the group of special pioneer publishers that most of those selected for the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead are chosen. To be a special pioneer publisher takes real planning. It means that the individual has to set a schedule of work each day. He can’t sleep in just as long as he wants to and get up when he pleases, and work when he would like to; but he must be on a schedule the same as the Bethel family, getting up at a certain hour in the morning, getting out into the field, making his door-to-door calls, and then making his back-calls and having book studies in the evening. By so doing, the special pioneer publishers are able to put in the required number of hours, and the Lord blesses them in their activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society aids the special pioneers to carry on their work, because they engage in the service in territory that, in many instances, is more difficult than usual. Many of them are working towns where no publishers live at all, and they put forth their best efforts to get new companies established and bring together the people of good-will. To aid them in this special missionary work the Society has helped them out to the amount of $227,473.99 during eleven months of 1943. This was in the form of cash sent to them by check, or credit applied to their accounts at their request. All this is in addition to the benefits that are given to all pioneers, such as convention allowances and special credits. The work accomplished by the special pioneers was well worth this expenditure. As long as the Lord provides these funds through the Good Hopes of the brethren, this work will not only continue in the United States, but also be extended to foreign lands through the special pioneer publishers that have graduated from the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While it is hoped, under the Lord’s direction of his Theocratic organization, that many hundreds of these special pioneers may be properly trained at Gilead and sent to other countries, there is still much work in this country for the special pioneer publishers. Consider for a moment the territory in the United States. There are 1,920 cities or towns of four thousand or more population available for special pioneer publisher activity. Of these towns 259 were completed during the previous service year, while 461 were completed during the past year. Now there are 565 assigned to the special pioneer publishers for witnessing. This leaves 635 towns still available for special pioneer publisher activity. Of this number there are only 99 cities west of the Mississippi that are open to special pioneer publishers, while 536 are east of the Mississippi river. It has not been possible in every instance to establish companies where these special pioneers have been for six months or more. It may be that, after giving the territory a brief rest for six months and then sending some other specials back, some interest may be found and small companies established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of the special pioneer publishers in the United States has received the rich blessing of the Lord. By His grace, it will continue here and be extended to all nations of the earth that the Lord may open up for the proclamation of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>GENERAL PIONEER PUBLISHERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">On August 31, 1943, there were 5,732 general pioneers on the list, to compare with 4,469 last year. It is of importance to note that there were 300 vacation pioneers all of whom are school children who entered the pioneer service during the summer months. This is indeed an admirable thing to do. It shows that these young folks desire to maintain their integrity and honor the Lord at every opportunity. Some of these young pioneers now going back to school to finish their studies and receive a better education will continue to put in many hours as company publishers on afternoons, Saturdays and Sundays, and will continue with their back-call and book-study work. The Lord is pleased with their splendid example for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was necessary, for various reasons, for quite a few general pioneers to drop off the list; some for financial reason and others because of circumstances over which they had no control whatsoever. Throughout the year of 1943 there were, on the average, 4,788 general pioneers in the field, and they accomplished an excellent work. It is to be observed that the general pioneer publishers put in only 111.8 hours per month, on the average, whereas the requirement is 150 hours. There are quite a number of pioneers on the list who are not able to meet the required number of hours because of old age and sickness; and thus the average of hours is down. Some of these brethren have been pioneers for many, many years, and, because of their faithful and continued service, will not be removed from the list. It is hoped that during the coming year the general average of these pioneers will be increased, however, because there are many who can put in more hours than they plan in their daily routine. Analyzing it briefly, 150 hours a month amounts to only 5 hours of field service a day. This is not much when one considers what the Devil’s organization requires of an individual. There one has to get to and from his place of work on his own time; but the Lord’s organization allows one some time for even that. A person who works consistently six days a week and puts in about five hours witnessing (actually going from door to door proclaiming the message), and one or two hours on back-calls and book studies daily, will find it easy to get in all his time in a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These pioneer publishers were very good in their back-call work, averaging 26.7 back-calls per publisher per month; and they are also conducting numerous studies, averaging 3.4 per week. It should be the desire of every pioneer to conduct one book study every day with some different group of people in his territory. This would keep one very busy; but the real educational work will be accomplished by the conducting of book studies in the homes of the people. There is still plenty of territory for pioneers, and, for the very good general pioneers, there is usually territory in the special pioneer service. The Society, however, is trying to keep the list in the United States at about 1,500 special pioneer publishers. The number of general pioneer publishers can go as high as the brethren desire to make it go. There are millions of people to talk to, and hundreds of thousands of these are undoubtedly of good-will and desire to be comforted in these perilous times. Consider the pioneer service, having in mind that the apostles and those closely associated with Christ Jesus engaged in a similar work, devoting all their time to the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>COMPANY PUBLISHERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">On September 1, 1943, we had 3,227 organized companies in the United States. The monthly average number of company publishers participating in the service was 56,484, putting in 9,173,160 hours. The report published gives you the details of their activities. It will be observed that the company publishers averaged only 14.8 hours per publisher throughout the year. Also, they averaged 3.4 back-calls and .3 book studies per publisher during the year. Having in mind the Declaration that all the publishers—special, general, and company—subscribed to at the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, during the coming year we look forward to an even greater increase in the number of back-calls and book studies conducted, particularly by company publishers, as well as the pioneers, who are putting forth an excellent effort now. In the Declaration, as all will recall, it was stated: “That in obedience to our commission we will endeavor now and in the postwar era to extend more widely the publication of Kingdom truth and to increase the number of free Bible-study classes in the homes of ‘men of good-will’ throughout the earth, using the educational means which the Lord has provided for our use. We are in favor of free education of all ‘men of good-will’ concerning The Theocracy.” The entire Declaration should be given very careful consideration by all companies at service meetings from time to time, so that they might review the vow that they made before the Lord, as His servants and representatives in the earth; and particularly the obligation they assumed on behalf of the men of goodwill, without distinction as to race, creed or color.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide are putting forth every effort to meet these people of good-will, but we must have in mind that where there are companies organized, or where publishers are isolated or in company territory, there are always people in that area who have not heard the truth; and, if they have, have not been sufficiently talked to about the Kingdom to convince them of the proper course to take. We know they love righteousness and they are people of goodwill, and we have found by experience that the way to assist them is to conduct in their homes the free Bible-study classes. This being the great work for the coming year, it should be presented regularly in service meetings and kept uppermost in our mind, so that the campaign of free education may reach out to its greatest extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was a real joy to see the great increase in publishers in the “Call to Action” Testimony Period, and to see how many publishers who for some reason or another had been idle responded to this call. All the campaigns throughout the year were enthusiastically entered into by the company publishers, along with the full-time servants, and a remarkable witness was given throughout the entire land, which can be observed by looking at the total report for the country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>EDUCATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Appreciating the need of free education for the people of good-will world-wide, the Lord’s people have also discerned the need of better fitting themselves to carry on this great educational work. To this end, in April, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font5"> was presented to all the brethren, and this has been taken up</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">enthusiastically throughout the United States and other countries. Many are the expressions of appreciation for this course, and many have found that by taking this course they have been aided in their field activity of presenting the message of the truth to the people from door to door. They are now freer with their words, and their expressions are more forceful and, at the same time, pleasant. Particularly has it been a great aid in the back-call and book-study work. It is believed that during the year the course in Theocratic ministry will be a great blessing, not only to the brethren who take part, but also to the sisters who attend and apply some of the things that they hear in the field service. The young brethren should take every advantage of this course; and the older ones as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question has been raised by some of the younger publishers in the companies as to how much education they should receive in the public schools before they engage in the full-time pioneer service or some other activity. Education along proper lines has always been beneficial, and a knowledge of how to study is vital. The training of a mind when it is young along proper lines of study and research will always be appreciated by the person in later years. It is a responsibility of parents to see that their children get this training in their youth. The schools throughout the country have been a great aid to the American people in getting a better education in reading and writing, and have, undoubtedly, prepared many of them to be in a position to read, study and accept the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the young people who are undecided as to just what they should do in regard to their regular schooling, it is suggested that they continue on through high school and get as much education in grammar school and high school as possible, particularly where the state law fixes an age limit. Probably the so-called “commercial” course will do them the most good as to preparing themselves for future service work in the field. If they take up bookkeeping, typewriting, shorthand, mathematics, and other general subjects, such may be useful at some future time, as well as chemistry, physics, or a language. English and history are always beneficial; for they broaden the mind. Some vocational course, such as carpentry, printing, etc., would not be amiss. Remember, Jesus was a carpenter, and Paul a tentmaker; others were fishermen. A trade may come in handy some time. Learn when you are young. While taking up these various courses in high school, which require only 6 to 8 hours of study a day, in most schools, it is well for those of the Lord’s organization who have dedicated their lives to the Kingdom to refrain from participating in school athletics and the social events of the high school. By keeping separate from the things of this world, one can more fully associate with the Lord’s people in the fieldservice activity. Many high schools close their doors to the pupils in the early afternoon, and some of the summer pioneers who are now going back to school find it possible to get in their 60-hour quota by spending a few hours in the afternoon and evening in the field service, and particularly Saturdays and Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such a course in younger life will prepare these young people, who arc looking forward to the pioneer work and the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, for that college. A young person’s proper early education and training will be a real benefit and aid to him in the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, or in any place he is privileged to serve his Creator. Young people wholly consecrated to the Lord should prepare themselves for future years of service. Knowing that everlasting life is set forth before them, they should fit themselves the very best possible to honor the Lord’s name and to sing praises of his glorious Kingdom. All of these young folks should take a very active part in the course in Theocratic ministry. Many plan to enter the pioneer service when they graduate from high school and put in the full two-year pioneer requirement, preparing themselves for the call to Gilead, and then on to whatever fields the Lord directs. What a future! May the Lord’s rich blessing continue with these young folks and their preparation for this glorious work. Proper education under the direction of righteous parents is a gift to be cherished for life, and one’s acceptance of it will never be regretted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>BOOK STUDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The free education of men of good-will can best be carried on by conducting studies in the homes of these people. The publishers generally are beginning to appreciate this all-essential activity, but there is great room for improvement in this regard. During 1943 the average number of book studies conducted weekly was around 40,000, to compare with about 5,500 reported the previous year. The average weekly attendance at these book studies was 96,000, or a little better than two persons to each study. When one says “40,000 studies a week”, this sounds like a lot of studies, especially when comparing it with 62,000 publishers. But let us look at what </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> being accomplished:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First of all, the special pioneer publishers are conducting about 7,000 of these studies. The general pioneers are conducting around 15,000. The company publishers, of which there are 56,000, are conducting only 18,000 of these studies a week. Is there room for improvement ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special pioneer publishers devoting 175 hours a month to the field service should try to make some back-calls book studies, one for every day in the week. That would mean that each special publisher would have at least seven book studies during the month, that is, seven each week. The total, then, for this group of 1,500 publishers would be 10,500 studies weekly. The general pioneer publishers, of which there are approximately 5,000, should have at least four book studies every week, making 20,000 book studies weekly. The company publishers, approximately 57,000, should have one book study a week per publisher. That would mean between 85,000 and 90,000 book studies every week, throughout the United States, if this schedule were kept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All publishers conducting book studies once a week would, of necessity, mean that they would have four back-calls a month, because every book study can each time be counted as a back-call. It takes time to educate people, and the book-study method is the best way to educate the people concerning God’s Word. Sit down in their own homes, use their Bibles, and arrange for meetings at a time convenient for them. They will soon show interest if they are people of good-will and love truth and righteousness. If they do not love truth and righteousness, then the Lord’s people need not spend any time with them, but find others. If all publishers, regardless of who they are (company, general pioneer, or special), take proper care of the book-study work, we believe that the back-call quotas will take care of themselves in due time; because we must make back-calls to get book studies, and, after we have book studies going, the back-call quotas will take care of themselves. 1944 should be a real year for book studies and the pushing forward of the campaign of free education for the people of good-will. 1943 was a fine start.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>SERVANTS TO THE BRETHREN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At the New World Theocratic Assembly, September, 1942, it was announced that servants to the brethren would be sent to all companies to aid them in their organization work. On October 1, 1942, this work began and 28 brethren were sent out on the road, and have covered the United States nearly twice during the past year. Their services have been greatly appreciated, and better organization has been established in almost all companies. In addition to the 28 brethren full-time on the road, many members of the Bethel family serve as servants to the brethren at week-ends for companies in the east. Some of the brethren at Kingdom Farm also have this service privilege. These brethren had the blessed privilege of staying with the brethren, in most instances, and, due to their short trips, the expense to the Society for carrying on this special service has not been very great during the year. The total expenditure on the part of the Society was $6,482.38. The kindness on the part of the brethren housing these servants and providing for their needs as they go from place to place is truly appreciated by all of them, and it is our earnest hope that in the years to come their services may be a still richer blessing to the publishers of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">When we consider that an average of 62,762 publishers throughout the year devoted over 17,500,000 hours in witnessing, it is to be expected that the Devil and all of his visible crowd would work up some schemes to thwart the work. There was opposition during the year, and we may expect that it will continue in the postwar era right up until the time of Armageddon, when the great Warrior, Christ Jesus, will clean out all opposers to the Kingdom. A brief report is given here concerning the opposition and some of the legal battles that were fought and won, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past year has been a time when Jehovah God has turned the tables on the enemy, particularly in the courts of the United States. Since the fatal flag decision day of June 3,1940, the judicial decisions adverse to the freedom of Jehovah’s witnesses to carry on their educational work piled high in many state courts, and in the Supreme Court of the United States. After what was thought to be a final blow against the Society in the “license tax” case decided June 8, 1942, by the Supreme Court of the United States, the infringements reached a climax. The series of invasions into the field of preaching on the American home front resulted in the enemy’s pushing the battle to the gates of the Lord’s headquarters on earth. To those of the world, and those of little faith, the situation appeared to be hopeless. To His witnesses who were faithful in preaching the gospel in spite of all opposition and court condemnation, it did not appear that defeat to these had been reached; but rather the persecutions themselves would yet be defeated. The faithful continued to hold fast their covenant obligations and steadfastly pushed on in the house-to-house witnessing and in public street distribution of Bible literature regardless of arrests, threats, and all manner of reproach, ridicule and violence from the Devil’s agents. The greater the violence, the greater the preaching on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the land, notwithstanding judicial condemnation by the nation’s highest courts and lowest courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this state of affairs the Lord’s people were forcefully reminded that Jesus Christ, the Greater Jeph-thah, leads the battle to victory over the “Ammonites”. At the 1942 New World Theocratic Assembly that thrilling and comforting understanding was received with enthusiasm and joy. Despite the numerous arrests and violence during the past year, 1943, the Lord’s people did not slack their hand. In the elevenmonth report set out here it is revealed that 1,500 arrests were made for preaching the gospel. Hundreds of these prosecutions have terminated favorably to Jehovah’s witnesses in the trial courts. A large number of cases taken up on appeal were dismissed, while still others were taken to the highest court of the land. There was a marked increase in the number of cases taken up to the higher appellate courts of the states and to the Supreme Court of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A total of more than 50 favorable decisions in the higher appellate courts have been rendered during the past year, and at the time of preparing this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font5">there are still many cases pending before the appellate courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While Jehovah’s witnesses faithfully carried on in the field, regardless of adverse decisions, appeals continued on in the courts; and in February, 1943, the Supreme Court at Washington heard argument on two cases appealed from Texas. By the Lord’s grace, the laws of Dallas prohibiting distribution of handbills advertising Christian meetings were proved to be invalid. Shortly thereafter followed the West Virginia flagsalute case, brought to the Supreme Court by the West Virginia State Board of Education and The American Legion, and it was argued before the highest tribunal. A wonderful witness was given in the court. A re-argument was also presented before the Supreme Court of the United States on the license-tax cases of Alabama, Arkansas, and Arizona.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then came May 3, 1943, and Jehovah’s witnesses had their day in court at Washington, D.C. This was referred to by a court attache as a “field day for Jehovah’s witnesses”, because of the unusually large number of cases decided in their behalf and state and municipal laws declared void by the nation’s highest court. The Opelika license-tax case, which represented three such cases brought up from Alabama, Arizona and Arkansas, was reversed, together with eight license-tax cases from Pennsylvania. The ninth case decided in our favor of a group from Pennsylvania, involving license-tax laws of Jeannette, the court affirmed, but also held the ordinance to be unconstitutional. Also another case brought up from Ohio, prohibiting any distributor from knocking on doors or ringing doorbells, was declared unconstitutional. On this 3d day of May alone thirteen cases involving Jeho-valfs witnesses were decided in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses. What a victory for the Greater Jephthah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then came June 14, 1943, known in the United States as “Flag Day”, including the celebration of the national emblem’s creation and its significance. On that day the supreme justices of the United States sat in court and handed down decisions; and it was on this “Flag Day” that the decision was given on the “flag case” of Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah’s witnesses were vindicated in their stand for refusal to salute the flag, after a long fight in the court over this very issue. The decision by the Supreme Court made void thousands of cases of expulsion of children from school for refusal to salute the flag since 1935. It was a rebuke to the pseudo-patriotic American Legion and Roman Catholic mobsters who had criminally violated the rights of persons of Jehovah’s witnesses, young and old, for several years. This “flag case”, brought up from the State of West Virginia, was decided by a strong majority, the vote being 6 to 3, in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses. Details of these cases and decisions have been set out elsewhere. On this same day, June 14, the Supreme Court unanimously rendered a decision in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses in the three cases involving the Mississippi sedition statute. The importance of this decision cannot be overstated. This decision seals the mouths of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their dupes from further saying that Jehovah’s witnesses are “subversive” and “seditious”. The decision brands such lying claim as unfounded, unjustified and criminal libel. While the official clamp has been put on the mouths of religionists and their hirelings, this will not stop them from carrying on their work against Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before these decisions were handed down the brethren in Brooklyn had prepared millions of copies of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front,</span><span class="font5"> and, in March, 1943, the president of the Society delivered this lecture for the first time in Los Angeles, California; later at Seattle, Washington. A few days thereafter, April 1, world-wide distribution of this vital message began. The people country-wide were shown that Jehovah’s witnesses are really fighting for liberty on the home front. This distribution of this booklet undoubtedly was of the Lord, for it came just two months before these vital decisions handed down by the Supreme Court of the country. Jehovah’s witnesses for years have been fighting for freedom of worship. You will note from the report that 15,000,000 copies of this booklet were distributed, or shipped out for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everyone should keep in mind that the court battles are not won solely because of the faithful and bold fight before the courts. Jehovah God gave the victory mainly because of the continued faithful preaching activity of his witnesses in the field. By their works of preaching, which had been condemned by the highest court, they showed their faith. In this condemned position before the highest court of the land, and standing before Almighty God, they depended upon Jehovah of hosts to give strength to them, who would turn back the battle at the gate. Here at the gate in America, by Jehovah through his unconquerable King, the Warrior Christ Jesus, the Greater Jephthah, the battle was turned back against and on the enemy legions, who now flee but who will continue to fight until the King’s final triumph at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In these latest decisions America’s highest court took a long step toward restoring itself to the position of confidence and trust long enjoyed by it, as custodian of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, in the minds of all lovers of liberty. Its decisions were greatly appreciated by numerous newspapers, and many write-ups appeared in editorial columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only was the “Jephthah” organization victorious in winning many battles in this land; but, as the report will show, the victories that Jehovah God brought to his people because of their full trust in him occurred in other lands throughout the world as well. The battle is not over, and Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide will fight valiantly until the final end; for all fully appreciate that ‘this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world for a witness’. It would take much space to summarize the numerous decisions of importance. Many of these have been reviewed in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> and commented on in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font5"> but it is interesting to observe that during the year some of the lower courts even went against the decision of the Supreme Court on the license-tax case in that they decided in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses, while the law, as far as the Supreme Court was concerned on the license tax, was against the Lord’s people. However, the Supreme Court finally changed its decision. The same was true in connection with the “flag ease”. Some of the justices in high courts of the land were not in favor of the persecution, because they had clear consciences and because they were upright, good students, and respected God’s Word more than a man-made idea. It has been a grand fight throughout the land, and the children who have stood firm through all of this trial and difficulty shall, if continuing faithful, receive rich blessings from the Lord under the Kingdom. Even now these consecrated children enjoy the favor of God in that they are his special representatives and ambassadors of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the midst of this world overrun by totalitarian rule, and where totalitarian rule seems to hold sway almost in every nation, it is good to see some righteous judges who refuse to submit the Bill of Rights to be trampled on by entrenched lawless elements. Such honest judges have refused to surrender their honor to the bluffing monstrosity of totalitarian emergency demands, but have held high the torch of liberty amidst a blinding storm of reactionary theories and claims. Such judges have joined with Jehovah’s witnesses in fighting for liberty on the home front. While they have not taken their stand for the Kingdom, they do appreciate that Jehovah’s witnesses have a right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience and they will protect that right as long as they can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On taking an over-all view of the past year’s activities' in connection with the report for the United States, it is plain to see that Jehovah has given the victory, through Christ Jesus, and assured His guarantee of freedom to all his obedient servants in his New World. It is plainly to be seen that freedom means liberty, liberty from restraint, to be actively serving Almighty God as he has commanded. It does not mean a license to do that which is pleasing to any creature. Jesus declared: “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” —John 8: 36, 32.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>OUTSTANDING EVENTS OF THE YEAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The first one began with “The Wise” Testimony Period, in October, 1942. This month found a great increase in hours, with a remarkable increase in the number of back-calls over the previous year. The brethren were really getting into swing with the distribution of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font5"> and this continued throughout the months that followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even more important was the putting into full operation throughout the country of Theocratic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font5"> under the Greater Jephthah, and the sending forth of the servants to the brethren to aid the companies to appreciate their responsibilities and to arrange for better organization for the future work. All branches of the organization have been greatly benefited by this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then followed the great </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign of February, March and April. This was the greatest campaign ever carried on in the United States as far as meeting people of good-will who desired to have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> come to their own home is concerned. More than 135,000 new subscriptions were obtained during this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign. This accomplished a great work and many new interested people were found during these months, and they manifested themselves during the next great event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This occurred in April, during the “Call to Action” Testimony Period, at which time there was a “Call to Action” Assembly, April 17 and 18. In the United States alone there were 247 cities in which Jehovah’s witnesses and people of good-will assembled for worship. On the following Monday, April 19, the Memorial was celebrated world-wide. It was at this “Call to Action” Assembly that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font5"> was announced and was accepted joyfully by all those in attendance. A new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> was released, “The Last War Wins the Peace Eternal.” Over 10,000,000 have already been printed and distributed. It was in this month of April, too, that a new peak of publishers was reached, namely, 72,490. Of this number, 66,079 were company publishers, and this was the greatest number of company publishers ever engaging in field service at one time in the United States. A peak was also reached in the number of pioneers engaging in the field service. Over 5,730,000 books and booklets were placed in this one month alone, and, in addition to this, 51,000 new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions obtained. It was during the “Call to Action” Testimony Period that a special effort was made by the Society to reach isolated people of good-will. Of these, 760 responded and took part in the distribution of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front,</span><span class="font5"> and these unassociated persons placed 25,302 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front</span><span class="font5"> was released during the month of April, on the first day, and to be distributed throughout the month with great enthusiasm, reaching a climax at the “Call to Action” Assembly. A marvelous witness was given country-wide with this message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year eame to a close with the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly on August 20, 21 and 22. This assembly, country-wide, overshadowed every other event of the year. The spirit of the occasion, the releases, and the Theocratic messages presented made it an epochal Theocratic event.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>“FREE NATION’S” THEOCRATIC ASSEMBLY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">August 20-22, 1943, are unforgettable days for the Lord’s people. Freedom was the theme for the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, with the key city at Minneapolis, Minnesota. With nearly all nations of the world at war, fighting in a great conflict for world domination, those persons who adhere to the free nation came together in peace and quiet to worship Jehovah, the only true God, and to look forward to the New World of righteousness and proclaim its liberties that are without end. For months preparations for this Christian gathering were made by the Lord’s people. It was decided that, due to the great stress on transportation facilities, many small assemblies would make up the national gathering for 1943. This was arranged, 100 cities were selected, and 100 conventions were held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the same time that announcement was made to the brethren in the United States concerning this gathering, notice was sent out world-wide, to all the Society’s branches, and many of the brethren arranged for similar “Free Nation” assemblies. What the ultimate end would be could not be predicted ; but, knowing that the Lord pours out his blessing upon all his people everywhere, we felt sure that some time in August all those who put forth an effort to bring about the assembly of those of like precious faith would be richly blessed. This was true. The details of the blessings received at the hand of the Almighty God have already been set forth in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> giving the convention report. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> has given many details; and space in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> does not allow for a comprehensive report. But a record should be kept of this all-important event of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Maine to California and from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico, the entire country was spotted with convention cities, all tied in at times with the key city, Minneapolis, by direct-wire telephone connections; and, in many cases, by the furnishing of manuscripts, so the lectures given would be identical throughout. This was a great saving to the Lord’s people in that the majority of them did not have to travel over 25 or 30 miles to get to one of the convention points. Of course, this relieved the transportation facilities in the United States of a great burden that they would have had to bear if a central point had been designated for the national assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this wonderful network of conventions arranged in the United States, our brethren arranged for like conventions simultaneously in other parts of the world: Brazil, Cuba, Hawaii, Jamaica, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, Trinidad, and West Africa. A week later the British Isles had similar conventions in 15 cities. These were tied together, not by land wires, but by the identical message of truth. Two weeks later Australia had 7 convention cities tied together by direct wire, and the message the Lord had provided for his people here in the United States was received by the servants of the Lord in that land with great enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Friday, August 20, the convention opened, and all in attendance were anxious to have some share either in the organization about the various auditoriums or in the field advertising the King and Kingdom, particularly the public meeting featuring “Freedom in the New World”, to which all people of good-will were invited. In the afternoon, in the Minneapolis $3,000,000 Auditorium, the first assembly took place. This auditorium was well crowded by ministers, representatives of the New World, anxious to hear the keynote speech of the convention. All knew that the name of the convention was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly,</span><span class="font5"> but, after hearing the keynote speech, all knew the real meaning of freedom, and the real freedom that they enjoyed from the hand of the Lord. They understood, too, why they were made free by Christ Jesus, not again to return unto bondage from which they had been liberated. All fully appreciated that thenceforth they must stand fast for freedom, because they knew that “for freedom did Christ set us free”. It was pointed out that in the postwar era the freedom that God has given us must be used in the interest and for the benefit of the people of good-will more energetically than ever before. It was clearly shown that our offensive against religion must be carried on with even greater force. All appreciated fully that Jehovah had given us the truth, and now that the arrows of truth were placed in our hands they must be used, because the “arrow of Jehovah’s deliverance” must now be used to smite the earthly visible organization of Satan continually. Deliverance must be heralded far and wide, so that the people of good-will may be delivered from the Devil’s organization and be made free, even as Jehovah’s free nation is now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following this stirring lecture by the president of the Society the vice-president was introduced, and he delivered a splendid talk on the subject “Freedom of Worship”. He pointed out what a valorous fight Jehovah’s witnesses had made for their right to worship, and what blessings the Lord had poured upon His peo-pie because of the efforts they had put forth. At the conclusion of his talk he released a new publication, printed by the Society, entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship, </span><span class="font5">which was appreciated greatly by all in attendance throughout the 100 assemblies that heard these two lectures. The booklet will prove a great aid to all the servants of God in their further preparation for witnessing for the King and the Kingdom. Fully appreciating that we have the freedom Christ has given us, we must protect that freedom by every means possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus the keynote of the convention was struck and well impressed in the mind of everyone: Freedom !! Not freedom so that one could return unto the bondage from which he had been freed; but freedom to represent the only true God and serve his Theocratic Government, and particularly to serve the people of good-will in the closing days of this old world. From that moment on all speeches delivered at the convention emphasized this same thought, and it was evident that the Lord put in the mind of everyone that brought messages of comfort to the listeners that the Textbook is the only guide for a free people to use and that the Lord is opening it up continually for our guidance and help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Came Saturday, the second day of the convention, and the crowds continued to grow at all the assembly points until, on Saturday afternoon, the attendance reached 75,536 in the United States alone. The principal sessions of this day were brought to all convention points by direct wire. The two-hour program brought the listeners a program that thrilled them and filled them with zeal to press on in the great work that the Lord has yet in store for them. The first principal speech of the afternoon was on the subject “The Free Nation Keeping Truth”, based on Isaiah’s prophecy at Chapter 26. The speaker plainly identified the free nation, and the work that it was doing and still had to do. Then two brief addresses were given by directors of the Society, the first one on the subject “The Service Must Go On”. Following this speech the Society’s secretary-treasurer took the platform and addressed the entire audience through the network. Brother W. E. Van Amburgh has been secretarytreasurer of the Society for the past forty years. He is now over 80 years of age, and it was truly a joy to see him there and to listen to his words of wisdom. He spoke on the subject “Progress in Face of Opposition”, and truly he spoke from experience, for he has gone through many periods of opposition on the part of the enemy organization. He, along with many other faithful ones, bore up under this opposition, maintained his integrity, and still rejoices in the great fight and continues in the freedom wherewith all of the Lord’s people were made free. His message brought great joy to the hearts of everyone. He spoke of the great witness that is yet to be given by the Lord’s people in the earth, and admonished all to press on with greater zeal than ever before, fully appreciating the responsibility and grand privilege we have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the secretary-treasurer came the president of the Society, who spoke on the subject “Free Education for Men of Good-Will”. The Lord’s people, upon hearing this lecture, appreciated more than ever before the importance of true education; not only the getting of a proper understanding of the chief textbook, the Bible, for themselves, but the conveying of this message to all peoples of the world as opportunity affords. The general history of education was sketched by the speaker, and particularly the educational work that Christ Jesus did, along with that of the apostles, and what is required of the Lord’s servants today. Knowledge of God’s purposes is of all-importance to his servants, and every one should put forth every effort possible to gain proper understanding of the Lord's Word, and should carry out the Lord’s will by actively engaging in the service. Having a knowledge of the Lord’s Word brings responsibility; and that responsibility is to see that other persons, such as the people of good-will, are given the opportunity to hear. That is where the great educational work comes in now: instructing and properly training the people in the way that leads to life in the New World. 'Freely we have received; freely we must give,’ was the command of the great Educator. They having received the truth, the Lord says they shall go and “teach all nations”; and it is quite evident that this responsibility still rests upon the Lord’s people. The entire audience, seen and unseen, enthusiastically received this message and by their applause expressed their agreement that the work still to be done would be gladly taken up by them and carried forward. At the close of the lecture a Declaration was presented and unanimously accepted. A careful reading of this Declaration, considering it as a vow taken before the Lord, places upon every one who said “Aye” at that convention a great burden of work which will be joyfully carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses today. So that due consideration may again be given to the Declaration, it is here reprinted :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Declaration</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions being gathered together world-wide in the 'Free Nation’s’ Theocratic Assembly, do hereby declare:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That Jehovah God by his truth and by the sacrifice of his beloved Son Christ Jesus has made us free; and that, though in the world, we are not of it, but arc of His new world to come;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That our freedom is not granted for any selfish or lawless purpose, but is that we may fully serve Him and the earthly interests of his kingdom under Christ Jesus;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That our commission from God ordains us to be his witnesses and ministers of the gospel of his Kingdom ; and we must perform our part as such in the </span><span class="font5">educational work which he has decreed must be carried on at the end of the world, where we are now;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That all ‘men of good-will’, without distinction as to race, creed or color, must be located and prepared for life in the new world; and that the educational work with the Kingdom truth is the most essential instruction to such ones now and in the postwar period, as it makes them ready for life eternal;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That our work is not subversive of present governments, nor for commercial gain or any selfish purpose or in the interest of any religious sect; but is for the purpose of spreading good-will among men, and promoting full respect for law, order and righteousness, upon which the permanent freedoms and peace and prosperity of the New World will rest;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That the textbook of freedom is Jehovah God’s Word, the Bible, and that the truths he has revealed therein by his Son and King at the temple make the people free, without which all freedoms announced by men are passing and illusory;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That in obedience to our commission we will endeavor now and in the postwar era to extend more widely the publication of Kingdom truth and to increase the number of free Bible-study classes in the homes of ‘men of good-will’ throughout the earth, using the educational means which the Lord has provided for our use. We are in favor of free education of all ‘men of good-will’ concerning The Theocracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It can be appreciated by everyone who is in a covenant with the Lord, and who accepts this Declaration, that he takes upon himself a great responsibility of carrying forward now the great work of conducting free Bible-study classes in the homes of men of goodwill throughout the earth, using the educational means that the Lord has provided for our use. The Lord has placed in our hands many educational means, and it appears that at this time one of the greatest is that of using the Textbook, the Bible, along with other Bible helps, in studies in the homes of people of good-will. Therefore book studies are the most important work that can be accomplished at this time; and all of us declared that we are in favor of free education of all “men of good-will” concerning The Theocracy. To demonstrate that we are in favor of this, the Lord’s people now move forward with greater zeal than ever before. They will use the freedom that they have received from God for the very purpose that they were made free, that is, that they may be God’s free people, proclaiming the message of the Kingdom far and wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately at the close of the adopting of this wonderful Declaration, which carries with it great responsibility, the president of the Society introduced the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”.</span><span class="font5"> This was accepted with great shouts of appreciation, and, when it was offered free to everyone who accepted the Declaration, even greater shouts arose, if possible. This publication, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”, </span><span class="font5">is the finest study-book that Jehovah, through his organization, has provided for the aid of the people of good-will; and it is believed that its use will be greater than that of any other publication thus far printed, save the Bible. Jehovah knows what his people need and what the people of good-will need at this time, and he provides them with the food that they can assimilate and make their own. He gives them those things that will guide them in the right path, so that they will not stumble and fall into the traps of the Devil’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font5"> will keep the people free who take the right course; and this textbook, along with the greatest of all textbooks, the Bible, should be a great aid in the free-education campaign of Jehovah’s witnesses in all languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This two-hour program seemed to be enough for one day, for excitement and thrills, and joy and appreciation, but everyone at the convention came back for more in the evening, and were richly blessed by the talks of the various brethren on the program. At the close of the evening session the question booklet on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font5"> was released, this being the first time that at a convention the question booklet was released with the main publication itself. Thus the publishers of the Kingdom were ready to go into the field immediately, as soon as they could get supplies, ready to conduct their home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sunday morning came too soon. Already two days had passed as though but an hour, and the expression was made by many, “If only this convention were lasting longer!” It seemed as though the longer the convention went along, the farther we got away from the old world, its entanglements, woes and troubles. We seemed to be in a world of our own, the New World under Christ Jesus the King, a free people enjoying the freedom that Christ had given us through his provision. At eight o’clock Sunday morning arrangements were made for a baptismal service, not only at Minneapolis, but also country-wide; and at this time 2,410 persons symbolized their consecration unto God, accepting the freedom wherewith Christ had made them free and declaring themselves to be publishers of the Kingdom, all to the honor and glory of Jehovah. Immediately thereafter these publishers were privileged to engage in field service, comforting those that mourn in the various convention cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publicity continued for the public meeting, “Freedom in the New World,” and in the afternoon, at 3 p.m. Minneapolis time, the auditorium at Minneapolis was packed out. The overflow hall in the basement was filled, and thousands were standing on the outside. The same was true at many other auditoriums from coast to coast; they were too small to handle all of the crowds. Some had overflow meetings, and many stood outside and heard the talk by loud-speaker. The total attendance amounted to 120,920 for the United States. The lecture “Freedom in the New World”, delivered by the president, was enthusiastically received by the public audience. The opening words of the speaker, “The free world comes only from the hand of Almighty God,” were definitely proved throughout the discourse. It was shown that this old world will never bring to the people freedom and the hope of life, or ever get them away from sin, religion and the Devil. Peace, prosperity and a world free from turmoil, strife and war could be brought about only through Christ’s kingdom. It was shown how man lost his freedom; and that now man is trying to free the world by some of his own creative power, all of which has failed in times past and again will fail. Propaganda can never bring about a new and finer world. It takes works; not works of man, who is born in sin and shapen in iniquity, but works of the great Creator Jehovah God and through His Son Christ Jesus. The promises set forth in God’s great Textbook, the Bible, were clearly presented before the audience, and they were joyfully received; for they too can now look forward to the New World of righteousness where they will enjoy the freedoms of peace, prosperity, life and liberty. At the close of the speech the lecture was freely distributed to the audience in booklet form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the 121,000 persons attending the public meeting, it was estimated that upward of 40,000 were newly interested people or persons interested because of the advertising brought to their attention in the various convention cities. World-wide the public meeting total was upward of 167,000. This includes the report from the British Isles and Australia, held a week and three weeks later, respectively. The world-wide total for immersion was 4,352 persons symbolizing their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s people received from their God in heaven a rich blessing in these three days, and in this period of time they appreciated more than ever before the freedom that God had given them because of their taking the right course. Not only were they free from the things of this world (although in it, they were not a part of it), but they were free to do a great work of educating the people of good-will. A person, to carry on this work, must be free from the Devil’s organization. He cannot be bound by the traditions and false teachings of this wicked world that is dying and passing out of existence; but he must be freed by the truth and then move forward in the work to free others. Besides those assembled at the convention, their fellow workers at home who were unable to get there because of transportation difficulties or other reasons felt the spirit of this convention on the home-coming of such fellow publishers who overflowed with the spirit of freedom. The Lord arranged this convention for his free nation. He planned it through his organization. He poured out his blessing on his people, and he has given them strength and confidence to press on in the years to come, to magnify his name and to finish the work that they started to do. By his grace, and with his help, the educational campaign for the people of good-will will be accomplished and done before the final battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The free-education campaign that was clearly made known to all conventioners is just the beginning of the work that must be carried on in nations now under totalitarian rule and under the heel of war, famine and pestilence. The Hierarchy has kept millions of people in darkness. The responsibility falls upon true ministers of the gospel to enlighten all righteously disposed so that they may be carried through into the righteous New World because of their taking the right stand and being made free by the truth that makes one free. The “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly will never be forgotten by Jehovah’s free people, nor will the work that began there. His message, by Jehovah’s free people, will reach to the ends of the earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES REPORTING TO BROOKLYN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s servants are found in many isolated places and islands of the sea. For one reason or another their work takes them to other lands; or, living in other lands, they receive the truth by reading some publication, or they meet the Lord’s servants while traveling. Such having love for God and his Kingdom, and his works of righteousness, Jehovah will see to it that they are drawn unto his organization. Having consecrated themselves to do the Lord’s will, he would naturally see that they are fed with food convenient; for the Lord uses only one organization in the earth to feed his people. So we find many individuals scattered far and wide throughout the land who do not work under any particular Branch, but they do serve God and want to make report of their activity to the office.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font5">This year we find that there are 260 publishers located in various islands and isolated parts of the world reporting each month to the office at Adams Street, Brooklyn. Of these 260 publishers 17 are pioneers. They put in 30,735 hours during the year, and placed 55,497 books and booklets. They have been carrying on the work the same as our brethren in the United States and other lands, and thus arranged for 6,063 back-calls and have been conducting 102 book studies each month. The 243 company publishers reporting are associated with 22 different companies. These companies are located in Alaska, British West Indies, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, British Honduras, Canal Zone, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Egypt, Lebanon, Colombia, Netherlands Guiana, Venezuela, Newfoundland, and Iceland. The pioneers are also located in some of these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The opposition in some of these countries has been very severe. In other places it has been difficult to get literature to them; so the brethren can only go from place to place and speak by word of mouth and present the gospel the best they can. Jehovah, in his loving-kindness and mercy, has, however, seen to it that the “meat in due season” reaches them regularly. Sometimes it is much belated; but the truth gets there just the same, so that they are strengthened to carry on the work. It is hoped that some day, and soon, special pioneer publishers may be sent to some of these islands and small countries to assist the brethren there in their diligent service to aid the people of goodwill. Plans are now under way to send some of the graduates from the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead to these various places just as soon as the government allows people to travel on boats again, and as soon as they can take literature with them into these lands. If it is the Lord’s will to open up many of these places, Jehovah’s witnesses should be the first ones to move in and comfort these suffering people. In these days of distress the people do not know which way to turn ; and unto His servants in the earth Jehovah has given knowledge and wisdom concerning his Kingdom, and this must be dispensed to the people of ■good-will. Thus the campaign of free education will, by the Lord’s grace, be carried on world-wide; not only in this land, but also in all lands throughout the world where the Lord may direct it to go.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In South America one of the principal Branch offices is located at Buenos Aires, Argentina. From here the work is directed in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The brethren in these countries have encountered many difficulties, and the hand of the oppressor was felt on the work. All the leading statesmen of the world continually talk about establishing good government and bringing about conditions in the earth that will benefit the people. Strange as it may seem, Jehovah’s witnesses, proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom, the kingdom of righteousness, peace and good order, are opposed by these same statesmen and the governments they represent. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere know why there is opposition to this message; everyone is taking sides as the settling of the great issue of world domination between Jehovah and Satan for all time draws near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the country of Argentina a greater witness has been given in the past year than in any previous year. 374 publishers engaged in the field work, of which 27 were pioneers. This is the largest number of publishers reporting field service there up to the present time, and these brethren devoted 75,881 hours to proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. The placement of literature is remarkable, considering the times and the lack of shipping facilities to replenish supplies. For twelve months there were placed with the people 267,330 books and booklets. Additionally, 3,430 magazines were individually distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It appears that the brethren there have considerable difficulty in improving their back-call activity. There was a slight increase over the previous year, when the brethren made 1,428 back-calls; for now they have reported 1,756. They are anxious to improve this work, but the Branch servant reports some difficulties. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this year we had many obstacles to hinder the proclamation of the King and Kingdom. Difficulties of all sorts were plentiful, but we kept pushing ahead. This last year they stopped our radio lectures, which we had been broadcasting since 1931. The general of the army, Uriburu, ruling the country in past years, allowed us to continue without Interruption until this last uprising of the military got control of the government. Now the Society has received a document saying that the official religion of the country is the Catholic religion, and that they could not tolerate any contradictions of their dogmas of faith, and much less by radio. They stated that the radio was a sort of means that did not respect the doors or walls, so they would, under the circumstances, allow us no more use of the radio to spread our ‘pernicious doctrines’ contrary to the Catholics. We can see that the Devil himself could not state It any clearer than that. At present we are using the radio station at Montevideo, Uruguay, and two in Santiago, Chile; and it is our intention to see if we can get in on a more powerful station in Uruguay, for their stations are well heard in Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In general the distribution of literature has improved over the previous year, but there were many causes that hindered our work and much opposition was put in the way of the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of us here are sorry that various conditions arose which would not permit us to hold the convention as did the other brethren throughout the world. We hope that next year we shall be able to do so. We did not get the things in time. We do not know the cause for the delay, but the mail did not get through. When the lectures did arrive they were read to the brethren in Buenos Aires and were appreciated very much by all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to the back-call work in this country, the people here show such lack of interest that it is hard to get them to permit us to come back. The workers are putting forth their best efforts, but it is because the people are so indifferent and do not wish to bother with anything that progress is slow. We confess, as to the establishment of book studies, that our studies are very low in number. It is not because of the lack of zeal on the part of the brethren, but because of the lack of interest on the part of the hearers. It appears almost impossible to arouse sufficient interest to cause a book study to be established in a home. The people here are fearful of having us visit them. In many places the brethren must rent rooms and invite the people to come there to study with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of the world send Kingdom greetings to all the Theocratic publishers throughout the rest of the world, and we resolve here to keep up the fight for the New World unto the finish.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are many people in this country anxious to learn of the truth who would gladly receive it if there were more publishers. There are only six company organizations in Chile. Associated with them are 68 publishers. Additionally, there are 4 pioneers. These 72 publishers have given a splendid witness throughout the territory and they placed 45,104 pieces of literature. This is an increase over last year. The hours spent in the field show an increase over previous years, the total being 10,596. The brethren there are just beginning to see the importance of back-calls, and this is the first year that they are reporting back-calls, showing 613 as having been made. There is much room here for good publishers, and, by the Lord’s grace, some servants will be sent there soon to assist in the great work of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant, who lives in Buenos Aires, reports concerning Chile:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren in Chile held a convention at the same time the Society held theirs in the States, and there were 110 attending at the meeting. The mornings were spent in witnessing for the Kingdom. In the afternoons they met together, using the material the Society sent them. The brethren in Chile were more fortunate than we in Buenos Aires, because they received their mail containing the lectures delivered at the convention at Minneapolis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Near the close of the year our brethren in Chile were practically out of literature. But we give thanks unto the King, for he saw to it that a shipment arrived just in time, before all of last year’s literature was gone. This makes our hearts glad and we desire to carry on the work here, so that many more people of good-will may take their stand on the side of The Theocracy and join the little, valiant band of Jehovah’s witnesses in this land singing praises to the King.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In this country the work is directed by a brother who operates the depot. He sees to it that the few brethren serving there are supplied with literature. There are 33 publishers engaging in the work now, to compare with 27 the previous year. These brethren were privileged to put out 4,946 books and booklets; a considerable drop when compared with the previous year. But all this was due mainly to the disturbance in the organization, which the Branch servant mentions in his report, from which quotation is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was considerable disturbance in Paraguay this year due to the depot servant’s discontinuing his work as a Theocratic fighter for the New World and giving heed to the Devil. He had thoughts different from those of the Theocratic teachings, so there was nothing to do but let him out. He was happy to get out from under the responsibility he had, but he will not be happy for long. The removal of this depot servant is a blessing to the brethren. While a few were disturbed and some stumbled, most of the friends did not agree with his ideas. Nevertheless he caused confusion and the work came to practically a standstill. Things have been rearranged and a younger brother, who seems to be the best available, is taking over the work at the depot and will try to organize the brethren the best he can so that the work will be carried on. I may be able to send one of the brethren from Argentina to serve as a servant to the brethren. I am looking forward to the time when someone will be sent from Gilead or the headquarters, and hope that it is the Lord’s will that this can be done soon. The brethren here want to work; all they need is the instruction and the proper aid.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The field is large, but the laborers are few in this country. There are only two company organizations, comprised of 15 publishers and 7 pioneers. The 22 publishers are doing excellent work, having placed 31,427 books and booklets during the past year. The brethren here are beginning to see, too, the importance of the back-call activity. In 1942 there were only 27 back-calls reported, whereas in 1943 418 have been reported. They have devoted 10,437 hours to field witnessing, and are desirous of having more workers with them so that this territory may be covered properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In writing about this country the Branch servant reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people are very materialistic. They have very little interest in anything except that of getting their own necessities for living and self-enjoyment. To get them to use some of their time in the study of God’s Word and purposes is nearly impossible. The little band of Jehovah’s witnesses here, however, have not given up, and they always do find someone who Is willing to hear the message of the Kingdom, and some progress is made. The Theocratic workers are putting forth their best efforts to let the people know that the day of reckoning is at hand, whether they believe it or not. The brethren in this country have been more fortunate than the brethren in others, because they have a good supply of literature, for which they are thankful; but it is hoped that further shipments can be made for the years ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These company publishers and pioneers send their sincere greetings to their friends everywhere, coworkers in the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>AUSTRALASIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has brought to his people in this part of the world many victories during the past twelve months. These victories did not come by sitting down and waiting, but they came because the Greater Jeph-thah was leading his organization throughout the world and Jehovah’s witnesses were anxious and willing to follow in whatever path he led. The Lord’s servants in Australia, even though “banned”, never slacked their hand, but continued to sing the praises of the Most High. Their work was difficult. They worked under persecution and great handicaps, but as long as the servants of God had breath they continued to do the work they were commanded to do, namely, preach the gospel of the Kingdom. While the work was “banned” the issue as to whether or not Jehovah’s witnesses had the right by law in the land of Australia to preach the gospel was a matter to be decided in the courts. On June 14, 1943, the decision was finally made by the highest court of the land. The ruling was handed down that the government had acted improperly in taking away from Jehovah’s witnesses their right to worship, and by this decision freedom of worship was again granted to Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since June much of the Society’s property has been restored to the organization. Books that were held in storage in various parts of the land, having previously been seized by the government, were restored. These are now being used by the brethren in house-to-house witness work. Some persons who were taken into custody by the government have been released; and the organization that had once been in operation in Australia received a new lease on life. Of course, the organization was never dead as far as the Lord is concerned ; but as far as the Australian government was concerned it was put out of existence, not recognized, and completely “banned”. This greatly hindered the work of the Lord’s people. Now that the ban is lifted the witnesses in Australia have shown their appreciation to the Lord for guiding them through these troublesome years by showing a great increase in service work. As was noted in last year’s report, there were approximately 2,800 publishers working and reporting. But right after the ban was lifted we find a new peak in publishers for Australia, namely, 4,328. There has been a constant increase in publishers during the year. Even in May, before the ban was lifted, there were 3,879 publishers engaging regularly in the field. The company publishers were averaging nearly 14 hours, conducting, on the average, 2| back-calls per publisher, and looking well to the book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nine months’ report, received before the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> went to press, shows that there was an average of nearly 4,000 publishers in the field, even during these difficult times, with a new peak in July of 4,328. Some of the brethren, while finding it difficult to get along, stayed in the pioneer work and the nine months’ report shows that there were, on an average, 134 pioneers in the field and 78 special publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren appreciated many of the rich blessings poured upon them, such as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry,</span><span class="font5"> the concordance in the Bible, printed by the Society, and all of the new books and booklets. The brethren in this land never went hungry for the want of “bread”. The Lord saw to it that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">articles reached there regularly and they were published and distributed among those desiring to have them. Now it is hoped that an even greater distribution of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> will be made among the people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Communications between Australia and the United States are still slow, but from some letters received from the Branch servant the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prospect of having the instructional course set out in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font4"> booklet is a most joyful one. All of the brethren look forward to becoming more efficient in the Lord’s work, thus having a greater share in helping the people of good-will. Ten thousand copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font4"> have been printed for use in Australia and New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Sunday, July 11, all the units of the Sydney company met in Town Hall. Twelve hundred brethren were in attendance. It was the first united meeting to be held in Sydney since the High Court victory, and was a most joyful occasion. At the conclusion of the meeting the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font4"> booklet was released. Heartfelt gratitude was registered on the faces of all present as, after two and a half years of hard fighting, they met together in victory and received at the hand of the Lord through his Society this wonderful new provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Previous thereto the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front</span><span class="font4"> was made available for distribution throughout Australia, on July 1. Although desperately short of paper, the Lord provided sufficient to print 150,000 copies. This number is not nearly sufficient for our requirements, but the publishers, one and all, are grateful for even a few copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">each so that they can have some share in the distribution of tliis most wonderful message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">High Coubt Case. The full court of Australia, consisting of five judges, held that the National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations were invalid. This means that we are now as we were prior to the ban. Three of the judges held that the entire regulations were bad. The full court held that at least some of the regulations were bad. Among the latter were the regulations giving the attorney general power to seize property, and the sweeping definition of “unlawful doctrines”. One judge pointed out in the court that the regulation defining “unlawful doctrines”, as it stood, meant that all the beliefs of a declared body were unlawful. Thus Catholics and Protestants, who believed in the ransom of Christ, were guilty of believing in an unlawful doctrine; because that is one of the doctrines of Jehovah’s witnesses. Mr. Justice Williams makes further reference to this in his judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Justice Stark pointed out that the regulations were in themselves “arbitrary, capricious and oppressive”. He said that the seizing of our property had little, if anything, to do with the war effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Return of Literature. The Commonwealth has returned, or is returning, all of our property. We have already taken delivery of our complete stock of literature which was at Strathfield, and I am pleased to report that it is intact. Just prior to the ban some heavy shipments of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> reached these shores, but were seized on the wharf. These shipments are now available for distribution. The phonograph records of the speech “Religion as a World Remedy”, which was delivered at Detroit in 1940, have also reached us at last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">United Sunday meetings have been resumed in halls throughout all of Australia. We are retaining the group arrangement for midweek meetings. The work is being organized as in the United States, with servants to the brethren. These have been properly trained and will begin visiting the companies throughout all of Australia, and the brethren will be delighted with these visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All our property will be returned. The military authorities are now using the head office, or the Branch of the Society, but they promise that this will be returned in due time. The Commonwealth and the Army will pay compensation for the use of the premises from January 1941, until they are returned at some future date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All other properties such as Kingdom Hall at Adelaide, Kingdom Hall at Perth, and the Society’s depot in Melbourne, and other places, are returned to the Society with due compensation. The Society’s boats “Lightbearer” and “Lightray”, the motor vehicles and the printing machinery, all of which were seized when the ban was imposed will be returned as soon as an adequate amount for depreciation is agreed upon. Bank accounts and cash taken from the Strathfield office and from larger companies will be returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Witness Wobk. Now that we have our publications again we are able to use them openly in the witness work. Also, the phonograph work is being resumed. “The New World” Testimony Period has set a new peak in publishers. The publishers have been most anxious to make the most of their newly-won freedom. Preliminary reports for the July “Fighting for Liberty” campaign indicate that the booklet is going out remarkably well. This month, the final of our service year, should set new all-time peaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneer Service. Due to insufficient literature supplies, the general pioneers have received limited financial assistance during the past few months. As soon as stocks of literature are available and can be shipped to them steps will be taken to discontinue this practice. The special publishers will, of course, be maintained as previously. The pioneers have done a splendid work during the ban and also now that it is lifted. The Lord’s blessing is upon the service generally throughout all the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The big event of the year was the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly in Australia. Arrangements were made to hold the convention in seven cities throughout the Commonwealth, and three in New Zealand. A cablegram received from the Branch servant indicates the Lord’s blessing upon this assembly. The cablegram reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eight thousand Australian freedom-lovers unanimous “Free Nation’s” Assembly most glorious introduction to expanding work of free education. 156 immersed. Keleases announced and Declaration adopted amid thunderous applause.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The government officials of this country have not yet seen fit to give Jehovah’s witnesses full freedom as the ruling body in Australia did. However, the brethren there move ahead with joy and gladness and do whatever they can to honor the Lord’s name. Very little literature is distributed by the publishers of the Kingdom; but we find in the report that the brethren continue to serve. From letters to hand we note that more than 420 publishers are regularly engaging in the field-service work. Some records to hand show that company publishers are putting in more than 15 hours monthly, while the regular pioneers are putting in approximately 120 hours, and the special publishers about 159 hours. There are only a few reports to hand, but those reports that have come indicate that these faithful servants of the Lord are going to continue to praise His name until the very end. They have hopes of having the ban lifted in this land, and every effort is made through the proper channels of the government to lift the ban, so that a greater witness may be given in the interests of the Kingdom. The report from the servant appointed to look after the work there says: “New Zealand shows a marked improvement over the previous year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is hoped that before another twelve months go by our brethren there may have the great privilege of carrying on the free education for the men of goodwill in a manner befitting the claims of the Allied nations. There is much talk about freedom of worship and the Atlantic Charter, but in many of these countries associated with the British Commonwealth of Nations this freedom has been taken away from the people. If their new policy goes into effect soon, it will certainly be a blessing for the common people, and Jehovah’s witnesses will do all that they can to educate the people concerning the Bible and the will of God toward man.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the adverse conditions that attend this total war, the work in Brazil has gone ahead at a steady pace. The Brazilians are naturally a humble, peace-loving people, not particularly concerned with trying to dominate the world. Many of them, because of the anguish and horrors of the present war, are now turning their minds to more sober teachings and they receive comfort from the Word of God. It is a joy to see the onward march of The Theocracy in this land; but there are still great opportunities open to those who desire to work in missionary fields. Considering the small number of publishers engaged in the work there, the increase has been remarkable. There are now 430 engaging in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom, to compare with 338 a year ago. There are now 29 companies organized, whereas in the previous year there were only 24. Of these publishers, 63 are full-time pioneers. Some of the experiences they endure show that only the Lord is taking care of them. These brethren put their full trust in Jehovah and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The distribution of literature is not greater than that of the previous year; however, 163,908 pieces of literature were distributed. Additionally, 15,328 magazines were used by the publishers in the street work and in door-to-door witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Interesting is the Branch report on back-calls made. The previous year the publishers made 9,592, whereas this year there were 14,149 made; showing that the brethren are appreciating more than ever the importance of making back-calls on the people of good-will. The publishers are working diligently. The regular pioneers are averaging 132 hours and making 14 back-calls. The average hours for the pioneers in Brazil is better than the average for the pioneers in the United States. The company publishers are doing excellently also, averaging 18.8 hours per month per publisher for the year, which is better than the report for the United States. Their back-calls average 2.7. These brethren appreciate the many blessings that have been brought to them during the year. A portion of the Branch servant’s report will be of interest to all:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our hearts leaped for joy to learn of Jehovah’s provision of the Gilead Bible College for training workers for the field to help In the work in Brazil and the other Latin-American countries. It is surely a marvelous stride ahead in the unifying of the work to be done under the Greater Jephthah. There is a tremendous work to be done here. Of the twenty-two states and territories there are eight where at present no witness is being given, and in all the others there are constantly requests for more publishers. We pray that, in Jehovah’s providence, he will speedily raise up more publishers; for there is a ripe harvest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is marvelous in our eyes how Jehovah has provided from his earthly headquarters the “meat in due season” so that it could be received without interruption by the Brazilian brethren, in spite of the fact that, due to war conditions, the mail from the States was delayed at one time for a period of nearly five months. The Portuguese edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, A Sentinela,</span><span class="font4"> has gone out every month, as well as the 16-page </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">('onsolacdo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> was received and published in a 36-page booklet and sent out to all the companies and pioneers. These have aided considerably in keeping in step with the advance of the Theocratic arrangement of the “Jephthah” Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The booklet Freedom </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in the New World</span><span class="font4"> was received on Friday, August 13, with your ‘ permission to have 50,000 printed. Outside printing of this number could not possibly be arranged in time for the Assembly; so we translated the booklet and ran off 2,000 copies on our little press and got them to the Assembly points in time for the Sunday afternoon lecture. The 50,000 will be printed soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gasoline rationing has not in the least affected the witness work in Brazil. There is not, so far as is known, a single automobile, bicycle or other conveyance In use in our whole field. In the Amazon region all travel goes by water (rowboats and launches), and In a few isolated places horses and wagons are used to a limited extent, but many of the publishers go about as did Jesus and the apostles, on foot from place to place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Various pioneers are following the method of concentrating on a territory, covering it again and again, making back-calls and forming companies. One brother and his family of six persons have been greatly blessed of the Lord. Remembering how a faithful pioneer several years ago called at his home leaving literature and, finding interest, called again and again until the interest of one member after another of the family led them, not only to take their stand for the Kingdom, but to enter into the full-time service, he left his own comfortable home in Sao Paulo for pioneers who could not so easily travel, and moved to the interior of the state where, in going over his territory a second time, he helped others to enter the pioneer service and has gathered together a live little company of publishers in at least two towns. More than ten of the present full-time workers were contacted and encouraged to enter the service by this brother’s faithful efforts and example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our territory, however, is so far-flung and there is so much of it in which no witness has yet been given that some pioneers are adopting the method of one who has been many years in the field and has overcome many handicaps, one of them being tliat he is a foreigner, subject to the Axis Powers. He rents a room in the center of his territory, where he receives literature and correspondence. With his phonograph strapped on his back, knapsack style, and a bag of books in each hand, he starts out </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">on foot,</span><span class="font4"> witnessing as he goes. The farther he proceeds, the lighter becomes his load, naturally. As night approaches, he inquires of persons friendly to the message where in the neighborhood he can spend the night. As the Brazilians are extremely hospitable, he is usually invited to stay, sometimes to sleep in a bed, sometimes on the floor. He repays his host by playing the phonograph after supper and telling about the Kingdom. Thus he really makes an extended back-call after having placed literature. He always carries </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> and copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A Sentinela</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolagao</span><span class="font4"> for those who show interest, so that they can contact the Society for further information. Persons have thus got in touch with the organl-zation, afterwards taking their stand on Jehovah’s side. In case there is no hospitality offered him he sleeps in the fields. After his supply of literature is exhausted he returns to his room for a short rest and study, loads up with more supplies of literature, and is off again. On rare occasions, such as Memorial and at conventions, he meets with his brethren. In the wilds alone he has many thrilling and dangerous experiences, but never for him has failed the precious promise of Psalm 23: “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.” His placements of literature are among the highest, as well as his number of hours in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ten workers at the Branch office resolved that, with the Lord’s help, we would increase our hours in the field, studies, and back-calls. Because of our small force and extra work at the Branch, it was not possible for us to maintain an average of 60 hours, although some members of the family made more than sixty hours every month except April and August, when we worked evenings and Sundays with preparations for the Assembly. We averaged 40.7 hours for the eleven months, and 11.3 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most effective means of witness is that of the conventions. Jehovah blessed us with two fine assemblies, one at the Memorial season and, to crown a blessed year, the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses held in six different Brazilian cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On April 16, just two days before the convention, we were informed that the police permit had been denied, with a long list of charges against the Society, the Branch servant and others. Appeal was made above the head of the official who rendered this decision. Upon reaching the third superior, this gentleman refused to grant an audience, but sent word to the first delegado to hear the matter. The latter, whose information had been given him by a prejudiced subordinate, on hearing the presentation of the matter by the brethren and checking up on some of the charges, agreed that the Society and the brethren were victims of persecution by those holding divergent opinions, and granted the permission, a condition of which was that a representative of the police should attend each session of the Assembly. This was agreed to, and in the opening address such representative was welcomed and the hope expressed that he would gain information that would enable him to take his stand on the side of The Theocracy and receive life. There was no evidence of any officer present at any of the other meetings, and although the manager had warned that the police always examined the “carteiras” of identity of the foreigners and excluded or jailed any subjects of the Axis Powers, no one was asked to present his “carteira”. Thus Jehovah gave his little ones a victory and cleared away the last stumbling stone to a joyful gathering of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Comfort All That Mourn” lecture and release of the booklet were of special significance, a benediction from the Giver of every good and perfect gift. The first shipment of these booklets had been lost on a torpedoed vessel. As we were receiving the news of this loss, came the announcement of a second shipment under way. The vessel carrying this second shipment, trying to avoid submarines, went on a rock and nearly sank. Help arriving, the cargo was transferred to another vessel and finally arrived in port. The cargo was in such confusion that it was some time before any was released from the customs. From day to day our dispatcher promised our shipment, but not until Tuesday morning at eiglit o’clock did there arrive a few cartons of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort</span><span class="font4"> booklets, just in time for release at the afternoon discourse. The brethren were so thrilled at the release, on hearing how Jehovah had preserved the booklets and brought them to us, that they went out on the streets with them immediately, and the whole 5,000 disappeared like snow in the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ten persons were immersed, one of whom had already entered the pioneer service, and others show great joy to have found The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The full report of these six assemblies in August shows the enthusiasm and gratitude for Jehovah’s bountiful provision of nourishing food, privileges of service, and deliverance from persecution, as well as turning bitter opposition and interference into a mighty witness for the Kingdom. Suffice it here to give some of the high lights:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instructions and supplies from Brooklyn reached the office In time to enable us to translate all the principal discourses of the North American Assembly and many of the other speeches, so that during the three days sixteen different discourses were given and greatly appreciated. Two of the speeches, “More than Conquerors” and “Safety at the Climax of Judgment”, were printed in the October </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinela, </span><span class="font4">the “Baptism” talk in the October </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolagao,</span><span class="font4"> and these two magazines were released at the conventions at the close of the talks. We printed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> No. 12, which was released along with the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World </span><span class="font4">at the close of the public lecture. The oneness of Jehovah’s great organization has been indelibly engraved on the minds of the brethren here by the arrangements made through the visible part of the organization whereby the speeches are given in the native tongue simultaneously with the English in North America, and the booklet in Portuguese presented at the same moment as the English booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The convention points were scattered, and communications, not the best in these wartimes, such that there were thrilling, almost anxious moments when it seemed as if some of the material would not reach its destination in time. But how the Lord cleared away every obstacle! The adver tising was splendid. All the printing was done on our own press except the handbills, window cards, and signs for the information walkers. In three cities, the order for handbills was doubled. The brethren in Brazil do enter into this advertising feature of the work with a zeal that makes everybody “sit up and take notice”. This Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses is being discussed from one end of Brazil to the other. Our enemies by their attempted interference only help all the more to advertise the Kingdom of Righteousness which they blindly or stubbornly oppose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From Information brought to our attention it seems the attempted interference was a concerted effort of religious Intolerance. In Sao Paulo they were too sure of their ground. Things happened so fast that they didn’t have time for a counter-offensive until it was too late. The same kind lawyer who has so often befriended Jehovah’s people when they were sorely beset helped us again, made a noble defense of Jehovah’s witnesses before the local board of press and propaganda and the Department of Political and Social Order, and, when offered remuneration for his services, emphatically declined, saying, “That was for Jehovah.” He who never forgets a kindness done for His name’s sake in behalf of the least of his little ones will richly reward in his own due time and way this noble soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The adversary’s effort did not succeed in stopping the lecture, except in Salvador, and there the firm stand of the brethren remaining at their posts made an impressive and powerful witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the persecution increases interest increases. There have been more persons immersed in the Amazon river this year than in all other sections of Brazil. At one place a pioneer found a family of sixteen, all of whom accepted the truth and entered into the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the Branch office during the month of May while the Branch servant was away in Sao Paulo, the police called saying that they had come on complaint of some of our neighbors to investigate the Nazi propaganda that was being printed here. After talking with the sister in the office, who invited them to come back upon the return of the Branch servant, they stated: “We think it unnecessary to return. We have already thoroughly investigated this Society and find that it is all right.” Taking literature for his superior, the investigating officer asked for a booklet for himself, saying that he would like to read our Bible literature. Within the past few days another visit was made to confirm and complete the former report, giving an opportunity for a thorough witness to the two officers. They listened respectfully to the points made, read paragraph after paragraph of articles in the magazines pointed out to them in answer to their questions. Finally the spokesman said, much like Agrippa of old, “You would almost make a believer of me,” apologized for any annoyance they might have caused, and assured us that we should not be disturbed again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessed Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recounting the activities of a busy Kingdom year, our hearts are lifted in gratitude to Jehovah for the blessed results. There has been an increase In almost every phase of activity. There is more of a spirit of unity and better organization among the brethren everywhere. A great need exists, however, for capable brethren to visit the various companies and isolated publishers, and we look to the Lord to raise these up from the midst of the Brazilian brethren or to send some capable ones from other parts. The prospects ahead are for great activity among a lovable, humble, generous, hospitable people who need to be freed from the shackles of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Brazilian brethren look forward to the day when the president of the Society may visit South America. This is not because they look to a man as a leader of God’s people, but with a keen appreciation of untiring service in our behalf and love for the faithful servant whom Jehovah has appointed to direct the visible part of his organization. But whether you may come to us in the near future or not, we count it a joy to stand with you, shoulder to shoulder, as Jehovah’s anointed King, conquering and to conquer, leads us on until we have finally proved “more than conquerors through him that loved us” to the complete vindication of the great and holy name of Jehovah, our God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Our brethren in the British Isles have had the most difficult year of their experience in the proclamation of the Kingdom. With high-sounding words the principal leaders of the British Empire claim for all the world freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech, but at the same time place censorship upon a Christian organization and people who are worshiping God. The censorship ban, maneuvered undoubtedly through Catholic influence now operating in a Protestant country, has become more severe during 1943 than in years previous. Now no publications of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., may enter Britain. Up to this time no word has been received that the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font5"> has been allowed in that country. The brethren there have made protest to the government because of its action, but they are not disturbed by the course taken by the government. The brethren fully appreciate that their covenant with God must be maintained and, by His grace, they are keeping that covenant by proclaiming the message of the Kingdom far and wide. A marvelous witness has been given, though not in the way of placing literature, because they have very little of this. The only literature they can distribute among the people is that printed within the country itself. By the Lord’s grace, printing has been accomplished, not only by our own brethren, but by having commercial concerns do some of the printing for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you read the report you will enjoy the zeal and devotion of the pioneers in this country, as well as that of the company publishers. The difficulties under which they carry forward the message of the Kingdom to the people of good-will is far greater than those in many other countries. Then, again, the difficulties are not as severe as those encountered in countries that are wholly under totalitarian rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report of the Branch servant will bring much joy to your heart, and almost all of his report is herein set out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s blessing has been upon the work of his servants in Britain during the past year. Only with his guidance and the power of his spirit has it been possible to accomplish the work done in the face of the bitter opposition of the enemy. This being a time when the Devil is waging war against The Theocracy, he throws in his combined forces against those who stand foursquare for The Theocratic Government. The Lord’s people in this land have had to fight hard to maintain their right to continue proclaiming the Kingdom message. The year’s text, “More than conquerors through him that loved us,” was not given by chance, but surely, in the light of the year’s events, we see the hand of Jehovah over his servants, bringing them off more than conquerors. This text has been very much upon hearts and minds. Time and again during the year the Lord has made it clear that while his people move forward in obedience to his commands he gives them the victory over their enemies. The article in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> set the issue clear. Defeat of persecution is a practical thing by the aid of God’s spirit. It was a timely message from the Lord reminding us that a fearless witness must be given to the name of Jehovah, and, no matter what persecution is brought to bear against them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s servants will maintain their integrity unbroken and thus share In the vindication of his name. It is a pleasure to be able to report that the Kingdom publishers in this land are not in doubt as to whom they serve, and the purpose for which they serve. Under the test they refuse to compromise their precious Kingdom privileges for any other thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We embarked upon the new service year with new ditlicul-ties confronting us; for early in September it became evident that there was interference with our food supplies from the Lord’s table. The W’s failed to arrive and thousands of subscribers throughout the land were left without their copies. Representations were made to the censorship authorities with a view to determining why the supplies were being stopped in the mails. Only after repeated attempts to ascertain the reason was it possible for the Society’s representatives to gain an interview with the director general of Postal and Telegraph Censorship. We were informed that no reason could be given but that the decision was taken by the Government under the Royal Prerogative. We were referred to an order that had been issued by the censorship department banning the export of certain of the Society’s publications, including the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">WT</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> This was interpreted by the department to include both import and export, and the order has since been extended to include all Watchtoweb publications. This in effect means that we are unable to receive or dispatch any printed matter bearing the Watchtoweb imprint. Our brethren in Ireland are thus cut off from all supplies by this extreme censorship restriction. To this day we have had no explanation given for the ban. No doubt the Devil thought to curtail the Lord’s work in Britain and frighten many who were newly interested away from the Lord’s organization. If that was so, he surely made a great mistake; for, instead, scores of honest people were incensed at this unfair and undemocratic action. The servants of God were not unduly disturbed, nor were the thousands of people of good-will turned aside. Many who had been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">WT</span><span class="font4"> subscribers for forty years and more, as well as the comparatively recent subscribers, all sent their letters of protest to the minister of information. Thousands of Christians in this land appealed for the rescinding of this unjust ban on Christian publications. Letters were also addressed to members of Parliament, and sympathetic acknowledgments were received. A letter was sent to Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Brendan Bracken. In addition to this, a leaflet was printed entitled “Warning, to All Lovers of Righteousness”. This was circulated to all leaders and the press throughout Britain. At the time of this writing no relief has been obtained although many honest people have shown their disapproval. Among these we quote from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Civil Liberty,</span><span class="font4"> published by the National Council for Civil Liberties. It reads, “The arbitrary use of the Defense Regulations to satisfy the political or religious leanings of some responsible person is intolerable and must be ended.” However, the Lord’s arm is not shortened, that he cannot perform his purpose, for he will deal with those who rob his people of their necessary food. We commit the matter to him and await the day when he will avenge his servants and vindicate his own name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Food Convenient’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To Jehovah we give thanks for the refreshing and invigorating truths that have sustained us. Certainly “Thou pre-parest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies”. Our Bible studies have been rich throughout the year and the recent study of “Theocratic Order Under Persecution” is soul-satisfying. The many expressions of gratitude that come to this office bear testimony to the keeping power of the Lord through his visible organization as he provides the food that each one so much needs. The warnings to be sober lest we be devoured and swallowed up by the lionlike adversary, the Devil, have done much to keep our feet in the right way. Always the Lord’s word to us is timely and guards us from the entangling, enticing things of this old world. We wish to put on record, therefore, our thanks to Jehovah God for the bond that unites us to his visible organization as centered at Brooklyn. It can truly be said that these things are more precious to us in Britain now, because the Lord has demonstrated his power to provide for his own no matter what the enemy may do. He has cared for us under stress so that we have not missed one meal at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The field service now consists mainly of back-call and book-study work. The placing of literature is quite secondary. In fact, the supplies available to us are very limited. The paper restrictions make It almost Impossible to print literature, and it Is, of course, impossible to obtain supplies from Brooklyn. We are thankful that we have been able to make available to the brethren the new releases in limited quantities, but even with these we have to wait considerable time, as the printers are governed by the manpower available and the limited supplies of paper. The publishers appreciate that their commission is principally that of searching out the “other sheep” and they recognize also that this is accomplished by the back-call and book-study method. The Lord outmaneuvers these schemes of the enemy to stop the work; for he directs his people to the great educational campaign now to be conducted with the people. Publishers, hours, back-calls and book studies have therefore been the objectives before all during the year. There can be no question as to the effectiveness of the free-education work carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses. It Is being appreciated by many who know that organized religion has nothing to offer in the way of enlightenment from God’s Word. The established church is fast being turned over to Anglo-Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Church has not had the same blinding Influence here as on the continent of Europe, but the subtle Influence is at work, and most of the “Protestant” churches are now introducing all the formalisms and paraphernalia of Rome. As to the effect of the home Bible studies upon the church organizations, one Roman Catholic archbishop recently said: “Jehovah’s witnesses know how to wield the sword of the spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> did not reach us until late December. Not until January were we able to put them in operation in the British field. These instructions from the “faithful and wise servant” have been much appreciated and have brought us up-to-date in all features of our service to the Lord. The application of these together with the visits from the servants to the brethren rallied the publishers to an appreciation of their responsibility of bearing their own burden. It was more clearly seen that the individual’s consecration to the Lord obligated him to meet the Lord’s righteous requirements. Since these instructions have been put into effect in the field there has been steady progress in all vital features of the field report. With nearly all the people engaged on vital war work, appointments for book studies are very difficult. These have to be squeezed in at odd times of day and night. A good deal of time must be spent that is not accounted for in reports. The results so far as figures are concerned cannot measure the untiring labor expended by the Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The peak number of publishers was in June, when 12,239 engaged in field service. The number of back-calls was 997,636, and shows an increase of 43,811 over the corresponding period of last year. The hours of field service were 3,573,745. This is slightly less than last year but, having in mind that there was a decrease in number of full-time workers, it shows a better figure than for 1942. The book studies and book-study attendance cover only the eight months commencing January, when the new organization instructions were applied and the record kept. A total of 87,495 book studies shows that the publishers are now realizing the importance of this work. The attendance at these studies was 142,552. As the year has progressed there has been steady increase. The sound work had decreased considerably. To appreciate the reason for this it must be borne in mind that street work with the transcription machines has been brought to practically a standstill. So many are engaged on night work, sleeping in the day, that it is not practicable to operate the machines in the street without causing disturbance. Nearly all the sound attendance recorded is that done with the phonograph on the doorstep. The literature placements are subject to the supplies available, and the output is much less than for any recent year. A total of 1,786,017 books and booklets have been placed during the year. The magazines have been limited to the brethren in the companies and the isolated ones.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The majority of the full-time workers are on the lists as special publishers and seek to put in 175 hours per month in the field. Assistance has to be rendered to them from the London office. The number of “specials” averaged 682, whereas the general pioneers were 433, the difference being accounted for by those absent. The average of hours for the special publishers was 162.5; for the general pioneers the average was 122.4. The numlier of back-calls was 507,637. The book studies, 44,733. The book-study attendance totaled 71,040. The total literature placed was 757,190. While there are sheep to be gathered into the fold we know the Lord will make it possible for his servants to attend to this work; and so the pioneers go daily on, looking to the Lord to provide their needs. The financial assistance rendered to the pioneers during the eleven months covered by this report amounted to nearly £10,000. The Lord has prompted other faithful brethren to make this possible by providing the assistance necessary. So we give thanks to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time was short for us to make full preparations for the Theocratic Assembly in Britain to correspond to the time set in America. However, arrangements were pushed ahead, but it was not possible to book the halls for the weekend of the 20th-22nd. Fifteen convention points were fixed for the following week-end, the 27th, 28th and 29th, with the Royal Albert Hall, London, as the key point. After the experience of a year ago, when two of the assemblies were closed to us by order of the government, we looked to the Lord for him to make it possible for his people in Britain to meet together. The prayers of his servants were answered ; for each assembly was held and a most blessed time experienced. In all the preparations for this “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly there was not a hitch of any kind. On the previous occasion just ten assemblies were arranged in Britain; but this was increased to fifteen this time, and all were carried through according to plan. Never before in the history of the Lord's people in this land has there been such enthusiasm. The assembly points were London, Belfast, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Glasgow, Lancaster, Newcastle, Manchester, Blym-outh, Sheffield, and Stoke on Trent. The public lecture “Freedom in the New World” was advertised as widely as wartime restrictions permit. We waited upon the Lord for him to see that we got the manuscripts of the various discourses as well as the public speech. Although sent to us in good time from Brooklyn, they were not allowed to pass the censorship. By the Lord’s grace, however, we lacked no good thing. Tlie identical program was arranged for each assembly and the discourses were based upon material that had not previously been released to the brethren. Owing to difficulties with the printing, the new booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front</span><span class="font4"> had not been issued to the British field, but was available for release on this occasion. Why not give this in the place of the advertised speech? This is what the Lord provided and this was given. The effort to suppress the Kingdom message was turned against the opposers and the people assembled to hear “Freedom in the New World” were advised that it could not be given because it was withheld by censorship restrictions. At the close of the lecture substituted, the following protest was presented:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The manuscript of the speech by the president of the Watch Tower Society entitled ‘Freedom in the New World’ has not been received from America although dispatched at intervals through the mail during the past few weeks. For a period of almost a year there has been enforced a strict censorship ban upon all the Christian publications of this Society. Evidently this same censorship ban has been applied to the manuscript of the speech which would have been delivered to you today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This action in refusing freedom of expression on Scriptural truths is foreign to British democracy. At this moment there is in force in this country a censorship regulation that forbids the dispatch or receipt of literature wholly devoted to Bible study. The existence of such regulation and any action in banning this manuscript confirms all that has been stated in the lecture you have just heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When the ban on the Watch Tower publications was announced in November last year a vigorous protest was presented to Mr. Brendan Bracken, the minister responsible for the order. In acknowledging the receipt of the protest, he replied, ‘The order was only made after the Government had given careful consideration to the matter and I am not in a position to discuss the possibility of its being rescinded.’ A further protest and request for review of the situation was presented last month to the minister, and the following acknowledgment of the existence of the ban and refusal to alleviate the situation as follows, ‘As you know the Statutory Rule and Order of 2nd November 1942, and the subsequent censorship instructions which have resulted In the ban on the import and export of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society’s publications were issued as a result of a decision of His Majesty’s Government. I regret I am not in a position to add anything to the letter dated the 30th November 1942.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is submitted that all encroachments upon freedom of worship and interference with the God-given right to study the Bible, God’s word of truth, must be withstood. Here is proof that Bible literature and a message from God’s Word vital to the interests of this country, the United Nations, and you as individuals, have been withheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Are you in favor of such high-handed methods of Scriptural censorship? A censorship ban which gives neither reason nor cause for its existence. Do you believe it to be a Christian act to deprive peace-loving gatherings of Christians such as this from receiving a message from God’s Word? All honest people here assembled will appreciate the need for Bible study and the importance of fighting for liberty on the home front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“If you disapprove of such unwarranted interference with liberty and are resolved to fight for such liberty on the home front, you are invited to give your word before Almighty God now by saying ‘Aye !’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There can be no mistake as to whether there was approval or otherwise. Overwhelming support was given and later all signified their approval of a telegram being sent to His Majesty, King George; in text it was much the same from each assembly as that sent from the Royal Albert Hall which read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“After hearing lecture ‘Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front’ at Royal Albert Hall, London, during ‘Free Nation’s’ Theocratic Assembly, over 5,000 Christians are convinced that an unwarranted censorship of mails in Britain prevents freedom of worship of Almighty God by withholding from Jehovah’s witnesses Bibles, Bible literature and a speech due to be given to us today, thus violating Atlantic Charter and British justice. We respectfully appeal to you to remedy this injustice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A free copy of the booklet containing the speech was released to all present. The total attendance at the time of the public speech was 17,500. An item of the program which was enthusiastically received was “Theocratic Ministry”. The wonderful provision for each company to engage in a course in Theocratic ministry was outlined. At the close of this session the booklet dealing with it was released. Altogether, four new releases were available and the brethren were deeply grateful to Jehovah for his bountiful provisions. A resolution was also passed during the convention. This we attach hereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“resolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jehovah’s witnesses gathered together in Theocratic Assembly throughout Britain today, do hereby declare:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That Jehovah God is the great Theocrat, whose law Is supreme; and that Christ Jesus his Son is God’s appointed King of the New World and the Head of God’s capital organization, and that the time has now come when this fact must be declared before all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That we are unreservedly devoted to Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and therefore recognize our commission and obligation before the Lord God to proclaim the gospel of His kingdom and to thereby comfort all that mourn. That the commission received calls upon us to faithfully discharge our responsibilities by carrying the </span><span class="font4">Kingdom message to the homes of the people as Christ Jesus and his apostles did; that we will faithfully follow our Organization Instructions, using the equipment the Lord has provided, knowing that by so doing we shall have the Lord’s blessing and direction while we search out the ‘other sheep’ who are yet to be gathered to the Theocratic fold. This we must do without fail and regardless of all worldly opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That the unfolding Word of God reveals that, under the Lord’s guidance and blessing, the Watch Tower Society is the visible part of God’s organization; and that the only proper and rightful organization and rule of the Society is the Theocratic organization and rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That we are opposed to all forms of totalitarian rule and its interference with the worship and service of Jehovah God through Christ Jesus. We have complete faith in our Leader, Christ Jesus the King, whose example we will follow in the worship and service of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That, come what the Lord may permit, we will fight against all encroachments upon our time and liberties and press on in unity fighting shoulder to shoulder until He gives the victory by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Motion and second)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All in favor of this motion and in agreement with this, shout ‘Aye !’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The conventions closed with a message previously received at the London office from the president, and all were greatly thrilled thereby. To say that this was a victory is putting it mildly; for, with enemies all around them, the Lord’s servants assembled and held a glorious three-day assembly without a discordant note and the opposers kept at bay. We were reminded of the Lord’s words through Moses at Exodus 11: 7: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue.” No pressmen were near, and that was significant too. Everywhere the Lord’s people lifted their hearts to him in grateful thanks for his abounding goodness to them. The 1943 convention will live in the minds of God’s people as a forward step in the march of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Servants to the Brethren</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This service has been operating since January, and has been greatly appreciated by the alive brethren. It was found that seven of these special servants were sufficient to cover the British field in six months. They have paid visits to all companies once, and are now visiting them a second time. One of the servants is part-time and gives his attention to the companies in Ireland, of which there are only ten. They have during the eight months traveled 15,911 miles. From the letters received it is evident that their visits have done much to aid the brethren and the people of good-will. As they visit the companies special efforts are put forth by the local publishers to get the people of good-will together, and many have been aided to see their privilege of taking a share in the proclaiming of the Kingdom message. These brethren were invited to the London office to receive instruction before being sent out, and all agreed that this time together, carefully studying the instructions, was of much profit. They have kept the Organization Instructions to the fore and exhorted the publishers to keep close to them and thus experience the fullness of the Lord’s blessing in their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the year began there was curtailment in several departments, for we were not able to purchase materials. However, as the year has progressed there has been much work to do and this has entailed week-end and evening work In addition to the regular hours. Some of the office staff were released for work in the field as servants to the brethren. In addition, some have been forced to leave their duties for a time. This necessitates adjustments to meet the changing conditions. The Lord’s care has been manifest throughout. The outgoing mail from the office was 40,071. The mail received was 47,387. The printing department has been very busy, for we have had the additional burden of printing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">\VT</span><span class="font4"> regularly. We have also printed the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font4"> and several supplies of booklets. An outstanding experience for us was the producing of the 1943 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook.</span><span class="font4"> It soon became evident that we would not be able to get this printed by outside printers until late in the year. There has been much delay with this for the past two years. We decided to set about it ourselves with the limited equipment that we possess. By the Ixird’s grace we were able to get it into the hands of the brethren much in advance of recent years, and the brethren throughout the country were delighted to have it. The whole family worked hard to get it done, and only by so doing was it made possible. The total of items turned out by the printing department was 2,977,673. The shipping department has been much curtailed owing to lack of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving Notice</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of this writing we are delivering to all members of Parliament the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front</span><span class="font4"> together with a letter drawing attention to the unjust ban on our publications, believing that the Lord would have us do this so that none will be without excuse for this act which is against the Lord himself. All connected with the government will receive a copy of both in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bethel family consists of 24 members. All are working harmoniously together, as, of course, they should in the Lord’s organization. As they have opportunity they share in the field service with their brethren. There has been much to do, and all have seen their privilege of rendering unselfish service to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is with thanks to Jehovah that we have instituted the school of Theocratic instruction with the use of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry.</span><span class="font4"> This has been in operation now for a few months, and all agree that much benefit is derived therefrom. We hope to become more efficient servants by use of the course. All are applying themselves to it seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We cannot conclude this report without assuring you of the love of the British brethren for their brethren In all other lands who are devoted to Jehovah. For the stream of wise counsel that proceeds from headquarters to us we give heartfelt thanks to the Giver of all good gifts. Among all the perplexing mix-ups of this evil world, we have that wisdom from above to guide us; with this we are determined to go on serving Jehovah. We will seek his counsel and “teach others also” in 1944 as we have in 1943. We look to the day when we will have greater liberty to push on with our work while we make full use of our present privileges. To you, Brother Knorr, we extend our warm love, and should the day come soon when you will be able to visit us you can be assured that there will be a great welcome for you. We know that there are great numbers of the Lord’s “other sheep” in this land and these must be gathered into the fold. We are united in purpose and we are fully resolved to fight on shoulder to shoulder until Jehovah gives the final victory by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in this little country have been greatly hindered in their proclamation of the Kingdom. There has been a decrease of publishers in this land. There are many reasons that could be given for this. While this country is under the rule of Britain, the literature here is banned. This by no means has stopped the Lord’s people from doing the real work. Only 469 pieces of literature were distributed by the 23 publishers, to compare with 13,386 of the previous year. However, the interesting thing is the number of back-calls these 23 publishers made, namely, 3,728, to compare with 3,690 of a year ago. Here they have not slacked their hand at all. While the report shows hardly any literature distributed, it does show that the brethren kept up their back-call work and did a little better than last year. There are only 4 companies in British Guiana, and 2 pioneers; but, by the Lord’s grace, they are pushing ahead, in most instances having only the Bible, and this is sufficient. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> and other publications are banned, but the Lord will see to it that they are properly fed by their reading the Word of God. When the new truths are allowed to enter, which we hope will be soon, these brethren will feed upon these truths with joy and relish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we have previously reported, the ban on the Society’s literature, which was only partial in 1942, is now complete, and the local authorities have detained the last shipment that arrived in the colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This decision has seriously affected our work here, but we are endeavoring to overcome this obstacle, as well as all others related to this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the same time, we view with dismay the quantity &lt;jf literature now in storage here, realizing that it was provided by the sacrifice of our brethren at headquarters, and also that it could be effectively used elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two conventions were held during the year, the latter one synchronizing with the Minneapolis convention, and there about 500 persons were given a good witness in one way or another. All who attended the sessions have testified to the blessings received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We feel isolated from our brethren in the north to a con siderable extent, now that we no longer receive regular reports and advice from Brooklyn, but we are conscious of the Lord’s promise to guide and comfort all who trust in him, and we strive to maintain unshaken confidence in bis provision for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To our brethren in various parts of the earth we send loving greeting. We look forward to the day when The Theocratic Government will be in complete control of this earth’s affairs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As Jehovah’s work progresses, the gathering of the “other sheep” continues in Canada. Our fellow servants in this northern country understand all that it means to work against interference and much opposition. Were they to try to carry on in their own strength, and in human wisdom, their efforts would not have been successful; but, by the Lord’s grace, and always recognizing Him as the Director of his people, they have moved forward during the past year with remarkable success and unusual blessings. Throughout the entire year the ban was still upon the Lord’s people in Canada, and it was “illegal” to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. However, a few days before writing this report, information was received at the president’s office that on October 14, 1943, the prime minister lifted the ban on Jehovah’s witnesses, only. The ban still remains against the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and the International Bible Students Association. Why this has been done cannot be determined at the moment, but we are sure that Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada will put forth even greater effort than ever before to magnify the Lord’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reports have come in during the year, and a letter was recently received from that country, from which quotations are made. All of the Lord’s anointed and their companions everywhere will be glad to read these excerpts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The field of worship pertaining to the publishing of the gospel from house to house had been regained, but the field of worship insofar as united meetings were concerned had to be fought for and conquered. Studies had been held in homes since the ban, yet it was still forbidden by law to meet together as Jehovah’s witnesses. The publishers of the Theocratic New World are convinced the Lord will give strength to his people, and it was in this condition of heart and mind that the publishers gained courage to hold their meetings. United weekly meetings are now being held, and the brethren are determined to fight for this right, no matter what it costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Halls were engaged for the Memorial in 1943. One meeting was interrupted in the city of Montreal, Quebec Province. Eleven members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police rudely broke up this solemn meeting. The emblems were in full view of the intruders. The brother conducting the meeting explained their purpose for gathering, and kindly requested of these officers that they make their investigations at the close of the service. This request was refused. By this entirely unwarranted and unnecessary action on the part of a body of men who wear the uniform of an organization whose fame has spread throughout the world for enforcing the law justly, these men disgraced their uniform by intimidating a hall full of inoffensive Christian people whose only object in coming together was to partake of the emblems of bread and wine in commemoration of the Lord’s supper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the land approximately 15,000 attended the Memorial service, and between 1,500 and 2,000 partook. The number partaking is practically the same as last year, but the number attending has Increased by 30 percent. This by no means includes the many thousands of interested persons who would have been present had they received an invitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Great was the joy of the Lord’s people as they shared in the “Call to Action” Assembly, holding 23 assemblies. There was no time for invitations to be sent to the brethren in surrounding districts, neither was it possible to invite the interested, yet between five and six thousand brethren assembled. They were comforted by the preaching of the Lord’s Word and were equipped to go forward more aggressively in this warfare. They learned of the provisions for the course in Theocratic ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than seven thousand brethren have regularly proclaimed the good news of the Theocratic New World Government. Effort has been made to ascertain the results of the work performed by these publishers. These New World publishers are joyful and esteem their privilege the most important business of their lives, counting it an honor to serve. In eleven months considerably more than three-quarters of a million hours have been redeemed for field service. To locate the “other sheep”, and behold them feeding at the Lord’s table, is a joy indescribable. Those whose hearts are in this work are not content with just making first calls, but desire to return to the home and render further aid. Their hearts burn with desire to preach the good tidings of the Kingdom. So back-calls are made until the teachable children of the Lord obtain freedom, find their own feet, and walk the pathway leading to salvation. What blessed and joyful work! The back-calls to the homes must be in the neighborhood of 250,000. Studies in the Bible are commenced so the interested will learn of the New World and how to become children of the Most High. Many thousands of such interested persons are known to be attending these studies. A marvelous accomplishment for a people beset with many hindrances, yet valiantly going forward!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many publishers have left all to become full-time publishers. There are in the neighborhood of 500 such ministers devoting everything they have so that they might be found faithful to the Lord. The number has doubled in eleven months. Loyal, generous brethren have gladly offered assistance to these publishers In the way of food and lodging. Also through the ministration of elder brethren it has been possible for a monthly allowance to be made to some of the brethren, so providing for their necessities. Brethren who are devoting all their time to the service are spending between 150 and 200 hours each month in actual field service. The experiences of these brethren rejoice the hearts of all with whom they come in contact, as they relate the pleasures of service and the care and bountiful blessings of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is known that 250 have participated monthly in this ministry, making more than a quarter of a million back-calls, conducting 14,000 studies, with an attendance of about 30,000. In addition to proclaiming the gospel to the “strangers” many have also ministered to those inside the fold, obeying the exhortation of the apostle Paul: “If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.” (1 Tim. 4:6) Such faithful brethren do not have authority from some bishop of “Christendom”, testifying that they are ministers, neither do they teach the traditions of men, but rather “put the brethren in remembrance” of “good doctrine”. Therefore they are “good ministers”, though not believed such by courts and officials in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Certain mature brethren have visited the companies of the Lord’s people to advise them concerning the commandments of the Lord, and how to carry the same into effect according to his Theocratic arrangements. A visit is made twice a year to each place, and much appreciation is expressed. These servants are well versed in the knowledge of God’s Word, and therefore are equipped to show by example and counsel how his work should be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year 1943 has been a year of grand beginnings, and among the greatest was the knowledge of the Bible College of Gilead. This bespeaks of great things to come. No matter how dark the conditions in the world are, no matter what we may have thought concerning the closing down of service, the opening of this college speaks volumes. The Lord is indicating there is much work yet to be done, and the brethren in Canada wish to be in it to the limit. Though it is not possible for brethren here to attend the college at the present time, yet they hope to take advantage of the provisions in the future. In the meantime we are granted the information concerning the course in Theocratic ministry. Many companies of the Lord’s people are taking this up, and the brethren are enrolling with eagerness. It is amazing to note the quick development of those who commence this course, taking the lessons to heart with gratitude to the Lord. This is a wonderful arrangement. We know that “men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him”. (Isaiah 64: 4) Though darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people, yet His servants arise and shine, for light is come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without fall the Great Provider supplies food convenient for the household of faith. Though there is a ‘famine in the land for the hearing of the Word of the Lord’, yet this is not the condition among the members of God’s organization. His revealed word is as the ‘finest of wheat’ and like 'wine which makes glad the heart’. The Lord has kept the best until the last. The elders in Zion have been given a very large portion of Jehovah’s spirit, and so the table of the Lord is full of good food. The position of a Christian in a time of world crisis has been made clear. There are blessings too numerous to mention, but we do recognize that Jehovah is the Giver and Supplier of all our needs. We are especially grateful for the language in which the articles are written, and the manner in which the subjects are dealt with in such close detail, enabling all to comprehend the admonition to have love for God, for the brotherhood, and to be merciful one toward the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the mercy of the Lord and his protecting care it has been possible for the brethren in Canada to receive all the food provided for the inhabitants of Zion. Not one article has been missed, and we express our gratitude to Jehovah for his goodness. The brethren were able to receive the annual report, the information concerning </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World, </span><span class="font4">the reports of the Theocratic Assembly, and information concerning </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> in booklet form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Monthly information is received and studied by the publishers, so all will be assisted and have the privilege of participating in special periods. Every campaign has been engaged in during the year, and this has aided unity. It has been grand to herald the same message at the same time as our other brethren throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bibles are used by the brethren as they minister from house to house. Their testimony is woven around the Scriptures so that it will be very easy to turn to the Bible, enabling the hearer to receive instruction from the Word of God. This usage of the Bible has brought us much delight. Many have said, “This is the most marvelous work I- have ever engaged in.” There has been some difficulty in purchasing Bibles, due to the fact that the publishing houses do not have large stocks. However, some have been able to procure quantities of the Bibles specially required, and the brethren have been supplied. All are now equipped with a most remarkable Bible, viz., the Authorized Version containing vital information, which is just the instrument needed for house-to-house service. It becomes a real “sword of the spirit”, and the publishers are learning how to use it correctly. The highest praise is voiced for this gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year the brethren have done their utmost to cause public men and members of parliament to have the ban lifted on Jehovah’s witnesses, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and the International Bible Students Association of Canada. To date the ban of illegality remains. We briefly relate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year 1942 an appearance was made by Jehovah’s witnesses before a Select Committee of the House of Parliament. This committee fully investigated our work. A printed Representation was placed before them and argued, involving several hours’ discussion. This committee of 15 members, comprising a cross section of the parties of the House, was unanimous in its decision that the ban should be lifted. The House adjourned the same month as the committee completed its report. It was to have been placed before the House for adoption. This was not done, and it was not then known why the report from the committee had not been tabled in the House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to the date of reopening in February, 1943, some members had promised to raise the matter in the House, and find out why the recommendations of the committee had not been adopted. There was a three-hour debate on February 22 in the House, at which time there came to light the reason why the report had not been tabled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The minister of justice was compelled to make this concession. How paltry it Is when considered alongside the unanimous vote for the lifting of the ban of the 15 members of the Select Committee! The minister of justice is actually saying, ‘We are not permitting anybody to engage halls or meet as Jehovah’s witnesses, but if these people want to meet like other religious bodies they may do so. It does not become an offense to assemble in congregations like other religions. Remember, if you continue as Jehovah’s witnesses, then there will be prosecutions. Further, we will allow you to have an intellectual adherence to the doctrines.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses have always had and always will have an “intellectual adherence to the doctrines”. What they require is freedom to proclaim the truth without molestation. It is now not an offense for a person to sit in his own home and adhere to the doctrines, but woe betide that person if he publishes in any manner what he believes, because then he would be guilty of “advocating or defending the acts, principles, or policy of an illegal organization”. The Lord’s children will obey God rather than men. He commands the gospel to be preached, the warning to “Christendom” delivered, and His praises to be sung, and this we will do and most certainly not restrict ourselves to our own homes. Rather, we will obey the Lord Jesus, who said, “What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house tops. And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”—Matt. 10: 27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pressure brought to bear upon the minister of justice forced this small admission, though presented to the House in the form of a concession. This is ground gained and now used for further advance. From different parts of the country members of parliament have received many courteous, kind letters giving reason and offering good argument why the ban should not remain. It was suggested that members should raise their voices in the House to have the minister of justice take action and lift the ban.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After five months (on July 15 and 21) members were afforded the opportunity to speak in the House on this issue. Some were well informed and equipped with facts. Several members spoke favorably, and the minister of justice was pressed for an explanation as to why the ban remained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During two three-hour debates the following expressions were made by members:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As I have said here before, never have I seen a weaker document upon which to declare an organization Illegal than the document which was placed before the defense of Canada regulations committee last year as a justification of the action against Jehovah’s witnesses. I get letters almost every week from members of this sect who are being molested by the police while exercising their religious rights. I do not care what a person’s religion is, or whether he has any religion at all; that is his business and nobody else’s; as long as In the exercise of his beliefs he does not interfere with the rights and liberties of others, he is entitled to hold whatever beliefs he sees fit. I should like to see the minister of justice, before this house prorogues, do what should have been done a year ago, namely, lift the ban on all these organizations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There was not enough material in it on which you could shut up a dog, let alone a human being. I would ask the minister of justice to present to the House the reasons why this organization is still declared illegal, and why it is persecuted by the mounted police.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I wish to say with all the earnestness that I possess that the prosecution and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses under the defense of Canada regulations is a standing disgrace to this country, to the Department of Justice, and to the Canadian people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“If any individual among Jehovah’s witnesses rises and makes statements that are subversive, he can be dealt with in the same way, and I have nothing against that. He should be dealt with in the same way. But to outlaw the whole organization and to say that they cannot gather together as an organization and worship God freely is something that is absolutely contrary to British democracy. ... I am saying that it appears to me that the decision not to lift the ban on this organization known as Jehovah’s witnesses, an organization of Christian people who want to worship God in their own way, even though they hold some peculiar doctrines, does not seem to be based upon any factual evidence that they are subversive of the war effort. That is my contention, and I urge the minister that he lift the ban on that organization. That is what I am urging tonight. I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">do not believe the minister’s arguments hold water in the least.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But this fact still remains; that is, that no evidence has been placed before this committee that would justify the declaring of the Jehovah’s witnesses an illegal organization. In my opinion it is clear, pure religious prejudice that is maintaining the ban.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But it does make one wonder whether the action against Jehovah’s witnesses is largely on account of their attitude toward the Itoman Catholics, instead of their attitude of a subversive nature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Minister of justice answers :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As to why the ban was originally Imposed upon Jehovah’s witnesses, among other organizations, I have only hearsay information about that, because the regulations were passed at the very outbreak of the war, and this particular provision was adopted in June, 1940, a year and a half before I left my professional activities in the city of Quebec. I have ascertained, however, that this is a very large international organization and the amount of literature that is put out from the Watch Tower on behalf of this organization is something fabulous; it runs into tens of millions of tracts and various other publications. It is also well known that thousands of phonographs with recorded speeches of their great leader, the so-called Judge Rutherford, are being used to further enlighten the people. There are also, or there were, very large numbers of motor trucks fitted out with these phonographs and loud-speakers to blare to the population at large. . . . Their view is that human-made laws have no binding force upon the individual if they happen to contravene what these gentlemen regard as being proper human behavior. This doctrine is certainly subversive of organized society.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s people know that this last statement is not the truth. There is no class of people on the face of the earth today who respect man’s laws as do Jehovah’s witnesses, providing one thing, and that is, they do not cause the individual to sin against the Almighty and His perfect law of love. The brethren in Canada joyfully and respectfully obey all law that is right, not according to our ideas, but according to the righteous law of the Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More members in the House are now taking an interest in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Unable to receive satisfaction as to why the ban was imposed, and the reason for its being continued, in the face of the report of the Select Committee and the protests since, induces them to make further inquiry. This will go on, and may become an issue of great importance. The purpose-people of Jehovah know that no earthly power has ever been able to interfere with the work of the Lord without suffering severely. Such powers are fighting against God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a pleasure it would be if these opposers of the Lord’s work would see the error of their way, and repent of evil deeds, then recognize Jehovah’s witnesses as their true friends who are seeking only to honor the name of Almighty God, to sound the warning concerning the day of wrath, and comfort those who are meek, the Lord’s “other sheep”. In the meantime the Lord continues to pour his spirit upon his people in the land, so the work will be done in a very effective manner by word of mouth, going from home to home, making return calls and establishing home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great “Free Nation’s” Assembly Is over, and we have returned to our homes. Thousands of brethren attended one of the convention points. The joy of being present with our brethren in the United States is indescribable. The write-up in the September 15 issue of tlie journal expresses what we would wish to say. We can well echo its every sentence. Our hearts are full of joy and thanksgiving because of the blessings received. We can now express our deep gratitude to the Lord by praising his great and holy name, and by doing with our might what our hands find to do in the great work which lies ahead of us, made clear at the Assembly: “Free Education for ‘Men of Good-Will’.” With zeal and enthusiasm we will enter into this work and do all we can to aid the Lord’s “other sheep”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>CENTRAL EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It has been some time since the Society in Brooklyn has heard directly from any of the countries in Central Europe. All of the small nations have been overrun by the “king of the north” totalitarian dictators. They have seized Austria, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Rumania, Yugoslavia, and many other lands. In the midst of all this stands little Switzerland, which remains neutral and continues to allow its people freedom. The Lord’s work in this country moves ahead well, despite outside pressure, and particularly the inside pressure of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The totalitarian nations that have always served the Hierarchy well have not invaded Switzerland, and therefore the Lord’s work continues unhampered. The publication of the Society’s magazines continues, and the distribution of tracts and booklets goes ahead. The publishers go from house to house, as they have in times past, visiting the people and aiding them in home Bible study.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Our brethren there are standing fast for freedom. Very few reports come through, but from time to time we do learn of the faithful devotion and stand that Jehovah’s witnesses are taking in that totalitarian land. It has been reported that the Bible Students in Germany are ‘ringleaders of prayer and study groups’ and subject to Gestapo raids. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Science Monitor,</span><span class="font5"> published in Boston, Massachusetts, revealed in its issue of June 29,1943, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The arrests seem to have been made chiefly among working folk, among whom this religious movement is most widespread. One newspaper spoke of the arrest of a smith, a butcher, a baker, a teamster, and a wood chopper, all of whom seemed earnest adherents of the sect’s teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These simple folk seem most firm in their faith. Recently, seven of them were executed. The executions were marked by the unusual sight of the condemned men’s wives begging them not to sign a renunciation of their faith which might have brought them a pardon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“They are growing up like mushrooms,” is an expression frequently heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a radio broadcast of a few months ago it was stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before Rudolph Hess made his still rather mysterious flight to England, It was his task to suppress these Bible Students [speaking of Germany]—rather as in Biblical days Paul delighted in persecuting the Christians, until his sudden change and acceptance of Christianity. But since Hess left Germany the increasingly irritated Nazis have found no one who can cope with this secret religious group. True, they have just arrested a number of its adherents in the Black Forest region and elsewhere, but they have found no way to shake the faith of the unassuming working folk mainly involved. . . . They claim that these people are weakening Germany’s fighting morale by getting little children to pray for peace and for the return of their fathers and brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A large number of Germans who are not sympathetic with the Bible Students themselves, however, do not approve of Nazi tactics of suppression. They are inclined to defend the members of the group as martyrs for conscience, and to believe that the arrests and executions are a sign of Germany’s rapid progress toward the abyss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the reports are meager, once in a while some news comes through about the faithful stand of the Lord’s people in these downtrodden countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Through Sweden comes a report concerning some faithful brethren in Hungary:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I came across a notice in a local daily the other day reporting that 52 of our people in Hungary had been sentenced to varying terms of hard labour, while three had been sentenced to death. The latter sentences had subsequently been commuted to life imprisonment. One of the reasons given was that they had been keeping in touch with the centre of ‘this sect’ abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here again is a brief yet assuring notice of faithfulness on the part of our brethren, this time from Hungary. So it must be throughout all the earth where the Lord’s people are oppressed. They know they have the truth, and it is for the truth that they stand, never turning back to the yoke of religion’s bondage. ‘The truth makes them free.’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The following was learned from a report recently received:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work of preaching the good news concerning the Kingdom of peace and justice makes progress in our land. Many honest persons have received the joyous message and read it, but they seem to be hindered in one way or another in taking an open stand now for God and Christ the King. It is hoped that later they will. Of the four million inhabitants of Switzerland there are about thirty-two hundred that attend the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. Of this number only eleven hundred are publishers announcing the good news from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though the number of publishers appears to be small, a great work is being accomplished in that land. In 1939 a convention was held in Switzerland and there were eleven hundred in attendance. In 1940 another convention was held, with fourteen hundred in attendance; 1941, seventeen hundred; 1942, three thousand; 1943 (convention in Zurich), more than four thousand were in attendance. This shows the constant increase in the number of interested people coming to the assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through dispatches to American newspapers it was learned that on November 26, 1942, a court-martial sitting at Berne “condemned Hans Zuercher, local secretary of the New York Bible Society, ... to two years’ imprisonment, five years’ loss of civic rights . . . M. Zuercher, a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses sect, was . . . charged with violation of the law concerning propaganda endangering the security of the State and of infraction of the censorship regulations”. While the above information came through in the newspapers, as late as October 31, 1943, it appears that Franz Zuercher is still a free man in Switzerland and carries on with the Lord’s work. He has been attending the various conventions throughout Switzerland, arranging and carrying on the Lord’s service activity there; so evidently this is more propaganda against Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An article published in the magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Trost,</span><span class="font5"> a Swiss magazine, shows that Jehovah’s witnesses are not carrying on any subversive action, nor propaganda endangering the security of the state. It reveals an interesting story of a Catholic newspaper’s publishing an article entitled '‘The System of Jehovah’s witnesses”. In the article they asked four questions, to be answered officially. These questions were answered officially by Jehovah’s witnesses and the answers were published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Trost</span><span class="font5"> magazine. Also, this article was published in pamphlet form. Action was then brought by the government against the Watch Tower printing plant, and 6,400 pamphlets entitled “Catholics Ask Jehovah’s witnesses” were seized. These pamphlets contained the answers to the four questions asked by the Catholic paper. The Watch Tower printing plant addressed a protest to the government, pointing out its illegal action and requesting an annulment of the order of confiscation. This pamphlet was an official answer to an official charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On April 16, 1942, a personal interview with the governor of Sursee was obtained by the representatives of the Watch Tower printing plant and certain laws of the land were called to the attention of the government. A copy of the complaint finally drawn up was sent to the attorney general of the Canton Lucerne district. On May 4, 1942, the Watch Tower printing plant received official notice that the criminal proceeding against it had been repealed and the pamphlets were to be returned and fees paid by the state. The only “crime” that Jehovah’s witnesses appeared to have committed was that of answering a Catholic paper, and for so doing government action was brought against them. This is just another evidence of Catholic Action in operation against freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Word was received very recently that a thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses again assembled at Basle and there enjoyed a most successful sectional assembly. Word is to hand that much of the material presented at the Cleveland assembly here in the United States, and many </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles since then, have reached our brethren in Switzerland and they are feeding upon this food with joy and gladness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CUBA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are four million people in Cuba, and a few years ago there were just a few publishers who worked hard in the interests of the Kingdom. The Society opened a depot there so that the brethren might be supplied more quickly with the literature needed. The work continued to grow. In the last few years it grew to such an extent that it seemed advisable for the Society to establish a Branch office during the past year. This was done, and manifestly the Lord’s blessing is upon the arrangement. The report from the Branch servant shows that there are now 36 companies organized throughout the island. During the past year there was an average of 73 pioneers engaging in the field service. Arrangements were made before the year closed for some of the Gilead College graduates to go to Cuba to carry on their evangelistic work, and at the writing of this report 12 “Gileadites” are carrying on their missionary service there under the direction of the Branch. The Branch servant makes this report:</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font4">Cuba is one of the few countries that in recent years has received a rich blessing from the hand of Jehovah, because of sending some publishers into that land. The Lord has increased all ways and means for the people of good-will to now hear and obtain a knowledge of the truth. There are now 36 companies on the island, and associated with these companies there are 575 publishers who engage in the work regularly every month, on the average. There are more than 950 who have reported field service sometime during the year, and it is hoped that all of these will become more zealous and be regular publishers in the field. The average number of pioneers engaging in the field service totaled 73, but at the close of the year the number of witnesses putting their full time in the work had increased to 90. Cuba should receive a tremendous witness in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An excellent witness has been given by means of the radio, presenting daily programs of a half-hour each. Thus the free education of men of good-will continues by this means in Cuba. Reports from the field show that the programs are heard with profit by the “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two assemblies were held during the year 1943. The first one, the “Call to Action” Assembly, brought together an enthusiastic gathering of 1,454. Later in the year they joined in the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, and there were 3,775 in attendance at the afternoon public meeting. 345 symbolized their consecration by water immersion at these two assemblies. These seasons of fellowship were rich blessings to all the Lord’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prosperity and blessing of the Lord upon the work in Cuba does not go unnoticed by the Devil and his crowd. His representatives here gnash their teeth at the Lord’s organization and have caused some interference. Persecution has been manifested at several parts of the island, and arrests have been made. There were 13 brethren arrested; 8 were convicted and 5 dismissed during the year. Attempts are being made to appeal cases of the convicted brethren. Thus far appeal has been of no avail. This persecution has in no wise dampened the zeal of the faithful servants of the Lord. They realize that such will continue until the time that the Lord brings it to an end at the battle of Armageddon. The brethren in Cuba are standing shoulder to shoulder in Jehovah’s Theocratic service and are anxious to take the message of the Kingdom to all people in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Expression of their zeal is shown in the amount of literature placed, namely, 78,716 books and booklets. This was accomplished by the brethren devoting 235,832 hours In the field service. 560 new subscriptions for magazines were obtained during the year, and 12,744 individual magazines were placed in the field work. The back-call activity has gone ahead splendidly, the publishers having made 50,322 back-calls. The book studies are coming along very well and it is expected that much good will be accomplished among the Cubans in these book studies. The zeal of the brethren is a joy to behold.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Very little news was received from this island; but word came through recently from a pioneer carrying on the work there that much good has been done during the year. The results show that there arc 17 publishers working in the field, who devoted 1,180 hours to the field service during the year. What little literature they had has been distributed, namely, 163 bound books and Bibles, and over 5,000 leaflets (printed locally), booklets and magazines that the brethren had on hand. The publishers appreciate the need of back-calls on the people of good-will, and this they are determined to improve during the coming year. Hardly any literature gets in there. They have been without </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> for years, due to the war censorship in the Mediterranean area. The brethren are looking forward to the time when the literature can be sent in freely and the work can expand. The censorship department on the island has stopped all literature, and some time ago seized 12 cartons of books and booklets, holding them there in storage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few faithful brethren continue to preach by word of mouth and rejoice in their privileges. Jehovah will certainly bless their loving, unrelenting service in the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Despite the many problems our brethren in the Hawaiian Islands, and in Honolulu itself, have to face, they have gone ahead with joy and gladness in fulfilling their commission. The work accomplished in Hawaii in the last year has been on a greater scale than at any previous time. This is indicated by an increase in number of publishers, hours, back-calls, and particularly bound book placements. The report from the Branch at Honolulu shows that now there are 51 publishers engaging in the field service regular!}' and, of this number, 10 are full-time pioneers. The entire group devoted 19,683 hours to field service and placed 56,719 pieces of literature, over 21,000 of these being bound books. A fine increase is shown in all features of the work, the use of the sound equipment, the making of back-calls, the conducting of book studies, etc. The greater portion of the work is conducted by the pioneers and, by the Lord’s grace, they have given a good witness on many of the islands in the Hawaiian group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Branch servant’s annual report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following letter is from a pioneer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Those trying to serve Jehovah on the island of Kauai during 1943 have much to be thankful for. Interest among honest people is on the increase and there is every reason to believe some of these will take the necessary steps to become Christians shortly. One lady, who stated she always loved the Bible from her childhood, in spite of religious misrepresentation, is rejoicing in the truth, and doing her best to help others to understand. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World</span><span class="font4"> book is now being studied in her home. Another family, all of whom have had very little education, are deeply interested in The Theocracy, and there too a study is being held regularly. The old gentleman of the group, who never attended school in his life, of over seventy years, stated that from the time he heard the first Spanish record he severed all connection with the religious organization to which he had belonged from his youth. He also told of the hard-earned money contributed for masses, candles and other worthless things. Although unable to read, when asked questions in connection with the study he usually answers correctly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have had a few experiences with officials, and without exception all have resulted in a good witness and with favorable results. We join with the psalmist in saying: “Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.”—Ps. 144: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">pioneer on another island in making back-calls In an isolated section was informed the priest had been urging the people to burn the literature of The Theocracy, and had removed some of the people’s books from their homes. Finally one person took the matter to court and the priest was warned that if he didn’t stop he would be put some place where he couldn’t interfere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Companies. Company publishers are active and regular in the field witness despite working long hours and handicaps which exist, and they carry on in accordance with Theocratic organization instructions. On the island of Hawaii the company has grown smaller, not due to any deflection, but because 5 of its members have taken up pioneer service. The Honolulu company is happy in having had many from its members enter pioneer service too, and is rejoicing in many privileges of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Theocratic study course was Instituted at Honolulu, at Hilo, at Wailuku, Maui, with very fine results in progress made by the brethren. There are 20 enrolled at Honolulu, 6 at Hilo, and 3 at Wailuku. Much interest is shown by all, and the benefits are already apparent from the increased study upon the part of the brethren. It is clearly a gift from the Lord to his people. There are eight or more languages represented in those enrolled, and ages vary from 7 to almost 70 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly. August 20 to 22 was the occasion of a very happy gathering in Honolulu of those seeking to honor the name of Jehovah and of his King Christ Jesus. Practically all active publishers in the Islands were present. All pioneers were there, the Honolulu company having raised a fund sufficient to cover their airplane fares and expenses. The greatest number of brethren present at any one meeting was 60, and at the public meeting 96 were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The program at Minneapolis was followed, copies of almost all discourses delivered, these having been received in good time. Following reading of the address on Saturday afternoon and presentation of the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font4"> slips were provided for the names and addresses of those wishing copies, and 45 names were handed In. News of the book was joyfully received, and we just about had to put a chain on the one copy available so It wouldn’t disappear. We are looking forward eagerly to studying and using this new instrument in the service of The Theocracy, and we give thanks to Jehovah for its provision. At the public meeting on Sunday 54 names were handed in by persons desiring copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the Neto World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blessing of the Lord was manifest upon all the assembly, and it was a very happy and refreshing event as a source of strength and encouragement in the service of The Theocracy. All present joined in voting “Aye” upon the introduction of the resolution and in requesting that a radio message be sent to the Society’s president at Minneapolis, which was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the closing of a year in service of The Theocracy, all publishers here join in giving thanks to Jehovah for the knowledge he has caused to be revealed concerning the establishment of The Theocracy, and for the privilege of serving now under that great Kingdom. We join In sending warm greetings and much Christian love to all other persons of good-will toward Jehovah presently engaged in honoring His name. We look forward joyfully to ever-increasing activities in service of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The difficulties in the way of proclaiming the message of the Kingdom have not been lessened in this country, but, rather, have increased. The training of the Lord’s people, however, has been such that they are able now to give a better witness and overcome these difficulties. Having in mind always the year’s text, “More than conquerors through him that loved us,” our faithful brethren in India move ahead with joy and gladness and, in these most difficult times, show an increase as far as the witness is concerned. Their peak in publishers was 381, to compare with 344 during the previous year. But these publishers put in 100,205 hours. This is a splendid increase and shows the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. They also appreciate the importance of the back-call work and have increased this tremendously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">India takes in a large territory, the publishers are comparatively few, and the millions and millions of people living there are not reached by the message of the Kingdom; but those that can be reached are given an opportunity to hear. Thirty-seven companies are organized throughout the land, and there are only 20 pioneers engaging in full-time service. There is much room in this country for more workers, and, if it is the Lord’s will to open up the field, more will enter. Under present conditions this is quite unlikely. The Branch servant’s report says the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Inasmuch as the real index of progress is reflected in the number of active publishers, the hours spent in field service, and the number of back-calls made, the figures for these are first examined. This report covers eleven months only, but in quoting figures as an index of progress the percentages of increase in hours and back-calls have been calculated on the basis of a full year’s activity. The number of publishers rose from a peak of 344 in 1042 to a peak of 381 in 1943. Hours jumped up from 79,050 to 100,205; and back-calls, from 5,226 to 11,687. Thus it is seen that there has been an increase in publishers of 10 percent, an increase in hours of 38 percent, and an increase in back-calls of 144 percent. The average number of hours per company publisher throughout the year was 19.6, finishing up with an average for the month of July of 23. The special pioneers, too, have gradually increased their averages, and the report for July shows they reached an average of 159 hours each. There were 15 special pioneers in July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year opened with all the Society’s literature published prior to the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope </span><span class="font4">banned. Home Bible studies were being conducted by means of such publications as had been retained by individuals, current </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies, or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font4"> The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> was in the press and delivery of our own Indian edition began early in the present service year. As soon as these were in the hands of the publishers the more systematic and unified </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> studies replaced the more irregular ones in individual homes. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> Questions booklet was also prepared. We printed this ourselves on a duplicator in a neat, quarto-foolscap size, wire-stitched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the home Bible-study campaign got more effectively under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> booklet was also printed and published in India about the same time, as well as a special “Watchtower” containing the article “Final Gathering”. With this new literature we were able, once again, to offer to the public, without restriction, the message of the Kingdom in printed form, both in house-to-house work and on the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This has necessitated a great amount of labor on the duplicator, but the Lord has provided us with the necessary materials and enabled us in this way to keep everyone who manifested the desire for it supplied with the spiritual food so abundantly provided by the Lord for his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to this we have purchased quantities of Bible portions, Acts of the Apostles, and the Gospels, for use in street witnessing. The Lord has also provided us with some supplies of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font4"> These have been used chiefly in pavement witnessing, of which more will be said later on in this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Naturally there has been a decrease in the amount of literature distributed ; but the figures are encouraging. There were 2,140 books and 25,492 booklets distributed during the year, besides 3,849 individual magazines. The placement of books and booklets represents a decrease of about 44 percent on the previous year, but magazines jumped up 800 percent by reason of having the special edition printed in India. All other details of work show an increase. There were 121 new subscriptions for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font4"> studies, making a total of 220 copies of each issue circulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Intebfebence. Two special pioneers were arrested at the beginning of the year for being in possession of the Society’s Bible literature which had been proscribed by government. They were sentenced to three months’ simple imprisonment. Appeal was made to a higher court, endeavoring to challenge the legality of the ban, and thereby the legality of the conviction. The appeal, however, was not heard until the term of imprisonment had been served, and the conviction was upheld. A good witness was given at each court hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two pioneers (sisters this time) were ordered by a district magistrate to leave the town in which they were working. Appeal was made to the Bombay government against this order, not only by us but also by various individuals ip whose homes these pioneers had been conducting Bible studies, certifying that they had never discussed politics or the war effort, but the order was upheld. They left the town and have since been working without interference in another district of the same province. Their place was immediately taken by other pioneers who have continued to this day on the same territory. No further trouble has been experienced there. No other arrests were made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though the Central government gave its authority for the printing and publishing of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope,</span><span class="font4"> they have since issued an order forbidding the printing of anything emanating from the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, or its officers, even specifying that the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> may not be reprinted. They describe the Society’s Bible literature as <sup>-</sup>‘a potential menace to security and must, on the ground, be prevented from reaching the public”. We take courage from the words of Psalm 2 and, with the Lord, laugh and rejoice in being found worthy to suffer reproach for his name, knowing that Jehovah will avenge his own elect who serve him faithfully. The message of the Kingdom reaches the people just the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pavement Witnessing. This form of work has continued throughout the year, whether we had our own literature or not. Where it has not been possible to use our own literature we have used Bible portions together with some question cards. This has proved to be very effective. It has kept before the public the announcement of The Theocratic Government, as shown on the bags worn by the publishers, and also has been the means of contacting many people and making back-call appointments where the house-to-house work might have missed them. Many </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> studies have been started as a result of this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conventions. When we heard of the great Cleveland series of assemblies our natural desire was to have a share in this great witness. We set a time some three or four months later for assemblies in India, hoping that by that time we would receive sufficient information on the Cleveland program to be able to go through a similar program here. Owing to the great distances and the few, scattered friends in India it was not practicable to hold one general assembly at one time. The native friends in Travancore had a series of conventions and two were arranged for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">English-speaking friends. In Travancore there are 27 organized companies, with about 260 regular publishers. All these were well represented at the assemblies and good public meetings held with properly organized field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first of the assemblies for the English-speaking friends was-held at Bangalore, in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then In January we held our Bombay convention. This was the largest assembly of the English-speaking witnesses of Jehovah ever held in this country. Not large as compared with other countries, but every bit as enthusiastic. A good hall was engaged for three days and a public meeting on the Sunday evening was well advertised. Owing to the scarcity of paper there was a ban on the use of paper for posters; so cloth advertisements were used. These were hung on the backs of the publishers stationed at strategic points in the city, and leaflets were distributed, carrying the advertisement of the public lecture on one side and a neatly paneled quotation of Revelation 21:1-5 on the reverse. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> booklet was also offered to tlie public. In addition to this, all publishers wore Theocracy bags printed with the words: “Jehovah’s witnesses Announcing The Theocratic Government.” During the three days of field service 77 publishers placed 1,534 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> booklets and distributed 10,000 leaflets, devoting 676 hours to the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As in America, this assembly was crammed full of surprises. At every session some ‘new disli of food’ was released, and in some cases several Items came forth from the speaker’s table in quick succession, much to the delight of those present. We had just received a copy of the Society’s new Bible and this was the first exhibit following a talk on “Presenting the Sword of the Spirit”. Then came the release of several new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies, the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> the Indian edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font4"> copies of which were distributed free to all the children present, as was done at St. Louis two years previous, and, finally came duplicated copies of the public address for the friends only. There were fourteen candidates for immersion. It was a 100-percent success, with Jehovah’s manifest blessing upon every minute of the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tbavancobe. The work in Travancore is essentially a vernacular work among the native Indians, and for this reason is treated separately. The people are mostly very poor in this </span><span class="font4">world’s goods. Their standard of life Is about as poor as it Is possible to imagine in a &quot;civilized” state. The average wage Is about six to eight annas a day for a man, and four to six annas a day for women. An anna Is equivalent to about two cents American money. They live mostly in huts of dried palm leaves, or small houses built of laterite, which is very plentiful in the country. Their principal food is rice. The price of rice has jumped from about two dollars a bag to eleven, and there is great difficulty for the people to live in decency. All this reacts somewhat on the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. It serves to make some take more interest in learning of the only remedy, that is, The Theocracy, but it also makes it increasingly difficult to launch out on any extension of activity, because the people’s time is so completely occupied in providing a living. The work is a financial burden on the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Travancore government still holds the Society’s press and other equipment, and imposes its ban on any printing on behalf of the Society. This has made it difficult for the brethren there to carry on, but they have carried on, and still do, with some increase in the number of publishers, too. All their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies have to be translated and then written out by hand. The same was done with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span><span class="font4"> They cannot even get report forms printed. They are a simple, lovable folk, not quite so efficiently organized as their more fortunate brethren in other lands, but just as eager to be faithful and true witnesses, and just as determined to prove Satan a liar and share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name as others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Travancore there are 27 companies properly organized. Their highest average hours for any one company was 43, in July. The average hours for all companies was 20, to compare with 23 for all India that month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Special Pioneers. The record of the special pioneers is one of progress, too. In this country, with its severe climate and the peculiarities affecting the work, it is a great strain to meet the requirements of 175 hours a month, but almost all have accomplished it and the record shows a progressive increase. Sickness has interfered with some in reaching their quota. In a country w’here the great mass of the population is non-Christian, with a mentality strongly averse to anything associated with Christianity, the really workable terri</span><span class="font4">tory is scattered. One never comes across blocks and blocks of houses affording much scope for back-call work, which means that much time and energy is required in locating people likely to show Interest, or mentally able to understand the message in English. To keep up to the hours requirement month after month on this type of territory in a temperature rarely below 80 even during the night requires stamina, but by the Lord’s grace these faithful servants are rendering a faithful stewardship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They have been able to establish properly organized companies in towns where there had been only one, or perhaps two, persons interested. They have done all that seemed possible in encouraging others to ‘gather themselves together . . . before the day pass as the chaff’, and they continue zealously on. There are now 10 special pioneers enrolled.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country comes under the direction of the Branch servant at Bombay. Very few reports come through at the present time. There are two publishers, however, representing the Theocratic interests in that land. The publishers in Ceylon placed 466 books during the year and devoted 657 hours in the field service. They have made some back-calls and are doing the best they can under the trying circumstances. The servant says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Censorship and the banning of the Society’s literature in that land has made contact difficult. Reports from two company publishers, who have been quite regular in their activity, have come in irregularly. Bible studies sent to them do not always reach them. They have the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> and a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font4"> also the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peace. </span><span class="font4">They have also prepared some </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> leaflets. Both these publishers attended the Bombay assembly, and one of them remained behind for a time in order to make extensive notes of whatever studies had been missed. The summary for the entire year shows that these two publishers devoted 657 hours to field service and placed 466 books and booklets with the public. Their chief activity, of course, is the giving of a verbal witness and trying to arrange home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Looking into the year ahead we enter with renewed determination to let nothing separate us from the love of Christ, but to demonstrate, by that same love for the New World that he had, that the Devil Is a liar, and that Jehovah has a people in this evil world who will let nothing come in between them and their devotion to that New World of righteousness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The god of this world, through his agents, would like to starve out the Lord’s people and let them die for the sheer want of spiritual food. For some time now very little truth has gotten into this island of the Caribbean sea; but, in spite of all the effort put forth to keep the truth away from the people, the Lord has seen to it that things needful have gotten unto his own. Practically all the literature the brethren had in that island a year ago was distributed. This is shown by the distribution of literature this year as compared with that of last year. In 1942 115,700 books and booklets were put out, whereas in 1943 only 13,989 pieces of literature were distributed. The brethren, however, have not slacked their hand; because they put in 164,000 hours. A good portion of this time was devoted to the back-call work, and 30,000 back-calls were made. The report from the Branch servant shows an increase in publishers. In 1942 there were 933 publishers and in 1943 there were 1,078. Thus we see that the servants of the Most High have not slacked their hand, or acknowledged defeat, but rather they have gone ahead in the strength of the Lord, using their Bibles and what little literature they had to comfort those that mourn in this island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 134 companies organized throughout the land, and ample provision is being made to carry on studies. If the work opens up again, it promises to thrive among these faithful people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant sends in the following report: </span><span class="font4">One year ago we knew nothing of Jephthah, because of certain restrictions, and not until after the great program was launched were we able to get a glimpse of the prophetic drama, and then afterward by piecemeal were we able to catch the spirit of the Theocratic Assembly, emanating from the key city Cleveland. Then followed the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> and the putting into operation the greatest and most wonderful feature of the work, viz., “the servant to the brethren.” The importation of literature having been stopped, and the stock being depleted and almost out at that time, things were running at a very low and ebbing stage. The inauguration of the special service of the servants to the brethren could not be put into operation here until January 1, 1943. But there at home everything was set and all were enthused for the beginning of the work in October. Our facilities for launching this early in the year were very meager, and it required the first five months of the year, from January to May, for the brethren to make the rounds and with a short stay of a day or two with a very little in mind and less in hand to assist the brethren in building up flies, making maps, instructing in reporting, etc., in the initial visit of these servants to the brethren in visiting the various companies, and now, after seven months of such service, there has been a decided awakening culminating in the Theocratic assembly recently closed, and the zeal and enthusiasm say more than pen can express or any amount of words can convey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On account of the above-mentioned restrictions, the April Assembly matter intended for us here did not arrive until a month or more after the April date for the Assembly had passed. Thus the Theocratic ministry program could not be put on in its order. But, on July 20-22 it was duly executed as per the program sent to you (which I hope has reached you), in which every feature was carried out as outlined. With that matter came the announcement that there would be a nation-wide assembly in August, 1943, and on that date we had the benefits of the April program. The auditorium, though spacious, was inadequate for the crowd. It was otherwise engaged for the Saturday night meeting of August 21, and that session was held </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font4"> and at the Kingdom Hall. The seating capacity was but one-half as large as the audience required, which I had anticipated, and the program was put on by the use of the No. 4 sound equipment from the sound-car. The speaker was installed on the veranda and it was heard distinctly for two blocks away. The audience consisted of about 650, and only 306 were on the Inside of the building. All other sessions were held at the Metropolitan Auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Sunday afternoon, 1,110 persons were counted who heard the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study and the Theocratic talk and demonstration. And at night there were 1,400 in the enclosure, and, as one end of the speaker extended out the window, an additional 300 heard it from the street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“God’s Word on Vital Subjects” was made available to all publishers at the Assembly and since. It has been found to be very practical in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The meat is rationed, but every company has been served regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Theocratic Ministry, announced and demonstrated on August 22, has resulted in one school of more than 40 students, and several small ones, with more in prospect. The first one opened on September 3, and is now going strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s name is ‘excellent in all the earth’. (Psalm 8:1,2) For out of the mouth of babes and sucklings he has ordained strength; for example, there is one family of seven or eight children, who are taken from place to place for the strength of all, even the older ones, and they have surpassed all previous records. They are the delight of all who attend the meetings and hear them. These children talk like real grownups.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Anyone traveling through a Latin country will soon see the need of education of the people. Mexico has been overrun by the Catholic Church for years. The strongest means the “Church” has to hold its people in subjection is to keep them illiterate and superstitious. There is a great amount of work to be done in Mexico, as in many South American and Central American countries. Free education for the men of good-will will bring real comfort to these oppressed peoples. The Mexicans are anxious to learn the truth and, if given the opportunity, will accept it gladly. Those who have the truth there now are putting forth a wonderful effort to magnify the Lord’s name and make the message of the Kingdom known throughout all the land. The Lord has prospered this effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year 1943, the report shows, there were 1,565 publishers engaging in the field work, to compare with 1,188 of the previous year. Of these publishers, 110 are pioneers putting forth good effort to spread the message of the Kingdom. These brethren are really working, too, because they have devoted 542,063 hours in the field. This was an increase over that of last year. They appreciate the importance of using sound equipment, and, particularly, of making back-calls. The back-call work is a real need in this country, as it is in all countries, but it takes more time to help the people where many are illiterate and cannot read. They understand though, and the responsibility falls on the publisher not only to do all the reading, but also at times try to teach those who have the books to read. Education is a blessing, for then the individual has the opportunity of deciding for himself what he wants. The Catholic Church has kept from the people the knowledge of reading and writing ; thus they cannot decide for themselves what they should have. Sober-minded people who love righteousness the Lord will lead to the truth, and we feel confident that during the coming years many of the Mexicans will seek after the light and will take their stand. Those already associated with the organization are working hard, and the servant’s report shows that the company publishers are devoting 28 hours a month in the field service. The special pioneer publishers, of which there are only a few, have devoted more than 200 hours, on the average. The regular pioneers are devoting 137 hours a month. The Branch servant, who is newly appointed this year, reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year just ending has witnessed a never-ending downpour of blessings for Jehovah’s people in Mexico. One joyful surprise after another was given us. Certainly the Lord has filled our plates to overflow and we rejoice to be alive at this time when we can enjoy the added Theocratic privileges and service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the February issue </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font4"> made its appearance with a never-to-be-forgotten improvement. Instead of its just coining out with a larger type the Lord saw to it that a complete change was made. The publishers could hardly believe their eyes! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font4"> came out an exact duplicate of the English edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> The print was a joy to behold, the colored cover gave it added attraction, the secondary articles were something new, and then, as if this were not enough, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font4"> began to be published twice a month instead of just once a month as before. The thanksgiving must have been pleasing to the Lord, because a few months later, in June, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font4"> began to publish the daily texts I This has all helped the witnesses in Mexico appreciate more than ever how bountiful Jehovah is with those who love and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hardly had the publishers caught their breath after this surprise when another blessing was poured out upon them. In February the president of the Society and his secretary paid a visit to their Mexican brethren. Although only a few days’ notice was given, brethren from all outlying companies attended the special meeting arranged for the occasion. The president spoke to his brethren through an interpreter, informing them of some changes to be made in the organization in Mexico and exhorting them to overcome the Catholic trade-mark of illiteracy that has long been the curse of the Latin-American countries. This counsel was well received and the brethren are now striving to better themselves in order to become more efficient Theocratic ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While in Mexico City the president arranged a complete reorganization of Theocratic interests, putting the Mexican branch on the same basis of operation as the head office. Nothing was left undone. The. president saw to it that arrangements were made to print, in the Spanish language, the identical forms which the Society has long used to carry on the “strange work” so efficiently in the United States. These new forms are now in use in all Mexico and have proved to be a real blessing. He also arranged to have a better grade of paper used for the office and for the printing. The Branch was provided with some much needed office equipment, including an adding machine, filing cabinets, and other items, which enable the Branch to do more work in less time and with less help. For all these blessings we give thanks to Jehovah and his visible organization, the Society. While here the president also reorganized the family at the Branch, putting it on the same basis as the Bethel family at headquarters. New equipment was provided for the comfort of the family, such as a washing machine, sewing machine, a large modern cooking range, and many other articles which were much needed and are much appreciated. This has all resulted in a well-knit and zealous staff who are anxious and determined to work hard pushing forward the Kingdom interests in Mexico, all to the honor and glory of the great Theocrat and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The president and his secretary had no sooner left Mexico when the Society notified the Branch that they were to make arrangements for an Assembly in April during the Memorial. More blessings! The reorganized Branch went to work arranging for 38 assembly points for the “Call to Action” Assembly. This was the first time that a multiple assembly had ever been attempted in Mexico with an identical program for each place, and, as usual, there were those who deemed it “unwise” to attempt anything new. The speeches to be read at the assemblies were received at the Branch, and in record time they were translated, mimeographed, and mailed to the different assemblies. The Lord’s blessings were manifested by the following report:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Memorial this year was a further evidence of how the “other sheep” are hearing the voice of the Greater Jeph-thah and are meeting him with songs and dances. Although during the “Call to Action” Assembly 2,134 publishers took part in the field service (about a thousand more than last year) the number partaking of the emblems this year was only 36. The number partaking last year was 142!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The high point of the Assembly was the unexpected notice from the Society regarding the convention planned for August. The brethren shouted for joy. More blessings in store for His servants!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the “Call to Action” Assembly the street-corner witnessing was inaugurated in Mexico, using the same style as in the United States. Heretofore the publishers would walk up and down the street offering the magazines to the passers-by, and, while a good number of magazines were placed, the witness was not as effective as it is in the United States; that is, it was not a means of identifying the witnesses. Since the reorganization, and particularly since the Assembly, the street-corner work began in earnest. The publishers in the Mexico City company were the first to put it in practice with street corners assigned them. Soon the joy of this service began to extend to the rest of the publishers, and now- it is fast becoming a feature of the Theocratic service. In Mexico City, which is one of the best vacation spots In the world, due to its wonderful, all-year-round spring climate, the tourists are very numerous. The remarks made by these tourists when they see the magazine publishers on the street corners are enough to cause the publishers to burst with pride at being one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Often these remarks are heard in English: “My God, those Jehovah’s witnesses are here </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">too!”</span><span class="font4"> or, “Say Willie, did you hear that? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">. . . The Watchtower!!”</span><span class="font4"> or, “You just can’t get away from those people.” Many are the ones who take the magazines, stating that they didn’t realize the magnitude of this work until they saw the same work being done here in Mexico as in the United States. One lady had quite a talk with a witness and explained how she had a study in her home (in Los Angeles) and how she had never been so impressed with the imj&gt;ortance of the witness work before. She took a magazine in Spanish to show her “instructor” how she had been “talking the truth with Jehovah’s witnesses way down in Mexico”. It is a real thrill to walk downtown on Saturday afternoons and see the witnesses with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font4"> on every busy street corner. Jehovah has certainly blessed his organization with peace, prosperity and unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The next blessing Jehovah poured out upon his people was the “Free Nation’s&quot; Theocratic Assembly August 20-22. Here the Mexican publishers received more benefits of the reorganization. For the first time in Mexico’s history a simultaneous program was planned and executed with the same public lecture being given at each assembly as was being heard in the key city assembly in the United States. Information walks announcing the public lecture were conducted at all the conventions, and over a hundred thousand handbills were printed and distributed. All the printing was done at the Branch, and the fact that the necessary equipment could be prepared in time for the Assembly was an evidence of Jehovah’s guidance. Each one of the assemblies (12 In number) required different addresses on their handbills and posters for the information walkers. The brethren rejoiced to have a part in advertising the convention in the same manner as their American brethren across the border, and all entered joyfully in this new (for us) and unique service. The Devil tried his best and used all his pet schemes to interfere with the ‘'Free Nation’s” annual feast, but, by Jehovah's grace, he lost every scrimmage. Jehovah's Kingdom </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">has come</span><span class="font4"> and his servants now </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fight</span><span class="font4"> for their God-given rights. The “Free Nation’s” Assembly put Jehovah’s witnesses on the map in Mexico and his servants are determined to take advantage of this fact. Jehovah has provided his people with the “free education” and, by His grace, they’ll take the essential instruction to the men of good-will. All the Theocratic representatives in Mexico enthusiastically adopted the resolution offered them at the Assembly and are now proceeding to carry out their vow, even as Jephthah did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the literature placements have dropped this year, we feel that some real progress is being made with regard to reaping the fruits of the great quantities of literature placed in past years. The average number of publishers in Mexico has increased more than 22 percent over last year’s average, and the peak was more than 47 percent increase over last year’s average. This is Jehovah’s doing, and marvelous in our sight! Instead of there being a drop in the average number of hours because of so many new publishers, we find that this year, in eleven months, 40,431 hours more were dedicated to The Theocracy than in the twelve months of last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Back-calls show an increase of 18 percent over last year. Although this is a good showing, we expect to do much better during the present service year. Jehovah’s people in Mexico are now fully awake to the importance of this work, and, by His grace, we have learned that this is the opening wedge in our assigned work of taking the free education to the men of good-will. We now realize that through the back-calls and book studies the King is gathering his &quot;other sheep”, and we rejoice to have a part in this labor. Book studies have been carried on by the publishers in Mexico to some extent, but this has been done under a great handicap in that there had been no question booklet (in Spanish) to aid them. Thanks to the great Theocrat and his “faithful and wise servant”, the publishers in Mexico received the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> question booklet in Spanish, in September, and hence we look forward to a real increase in regard to book studies during the present year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the greatest needs of the organization in Mexico has been the help and counsel given by the servant to the brethren. This work has finally started, and, judging from the strenuous effort made by Beelzebub to prevent this service, we confidently expect a real blessing from our heavenly Father. W’e have started with two capable brethren, and expect to have two more soon, if it be Jehovah’s will. These two brethren were put through a month’s training at the Branch and are now well acquainted with their duties and privileges. Although it is very hard to get to the many companies, due to the limited means of transportation, the companies have assured the Branch that they will co-operate, having horses waiting for the servant, and will see to it that he arrives to give them the much-needed instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than ever do we realize that Jehovah has been preparing his visible organization for a great work yet to be done; and, having been freed by his King, we shall stand fast in that freedom, not for any selfish purpose, but that Jehovah of Hosts may be glorified.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>NORTHERN EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society for a number of years had an office in Copenhagen that directed generally all the work in Northern Europe. This included Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. All but one of these countries have been overrun by the totalitarian “king of the north”, which totalitarian rule has brought great oppression on the people. Sweden is the only country that has maintained its neutrality, and it is from this country that a few reports were received during the year, indicating that our brethren in other countries are standing firm and maintaining their integrity. Not for one minute do they slack their hand, but continue to preach the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not a great lot of information gets through, but sufficient to know that our brethren there are looking forward to a day of deliverance, and still another opportunity of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom to these hungry hearts that have undergone great suffering and sorrow. In some countries it is reported that some people actually seek out Jehovah’s witnesses and ask them for the answer for all this trouble. What a joy it must be to them to learn the truth, and feed upon the life-giving words of the Master! Jehovah’s servants stand out as a light in this dark world, and now many who are seeking truth come to be taught of the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country has been under the domination of the Nazi overlords for some time. During the year they have oppressed the Danes just as they have oppressed all other people coming under their rule. Jehovah’s witnesses in this country have continued faithful, and, even though working under the most difficult conditions, have shown an increase in work. The report is not for a full year, but merely eight months. In these eight months the brethren have reached a peak of 3,426 publishers in the field (February, 1943). The average number of publishers in the work every month runs around twenty-three or twenty-four hundred. A special work was carried on in February, 1943, in connection with the distribution of a free booklet, a message that the brethren wanted to get into the hands of all people of good-will that they could possibly reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The distribution of literature during the eightmonth period mentioned was 1,091,108 books and booklets, and the publishers put in 226,136 hours of field work. The magazines are going out well, or were up to the time of the last report. The new subscriptions taken during the year totaled 5,559, and 190,987 individual magazines were distributed in the street work and from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The back-call work continues to increase. 81,082 back-calls were made, to compare with 61,000 for the same period of the previous year. The brethren now see the importance of book studies. They have their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span><span class="font5"> The truths get through somehow, by the Lord’s grace and under his supervision, and our brethren there are being fed with the food convenient. We rejoice with them, and, by the Lord’s grace and with his help, will aid them in every possible way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are some interesting things that have been reported in a recent letter from the servant in charge of the work in Denmark. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The paper question here is very difficult and had we not bought up large stocks in good time from Germany and even some from Finland, we should hardly have been able to print our large editions of books. The new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> will be released in the middle of this month. This grand message will doubtless help many who hunger and thirst after righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With regard to both magazines, the situation is more difficult, as the government has issued Instructions that the present editions must be 15 percent less than in 1941, and they have control at the printeries. We shall have to overcome this difficulty in some way or other, even if it means printing on something the size of a dime and selling folk microscopes to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many thanks for all new organization instructions; these will be put In operation in the course of a month or so. We understand quite well the message, every man shall bear his own burden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have only one town left with a population of over 4,000 where there are no witnesses for Jehovah, and, the Lord willing, we shall attack it next week. With regard to going through the territory eight times a year, I can truthfully say that for all the companies of any size this Is done in the thickly populated areas. One company was covering their territory 26 times a year, until we increased their allocation. The covering of all rural districts eight times a year, however, is no easy task, especially as we are gradually wearing out all tires on our cycles. The prospect of getting new tires is remote. We do all we can, however, to keep our full-time workers on their wheels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The head office call for full-time workers was an inspiration and the word has gone out to the brethren here. The situation here, as you know, is not easy for pioneers, but who am I to say that the difficulties cannot be overcome when such a call to arms comes through the Lord’s organization. We shall do what we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My prayer for you, dear brother, and all of like precious faith is that we may be preserved by Jehovah to his honor and finally share in the great triumph of righteousness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people in this country have allowed themselves to come under the domination of the totalitarian rule of Hitler. They have suffered greatly for this, and undoubtedly will continue to suffer. The Lord’s people in this country desire only to magnify the Lord’s name, and have pushed ahead with the work under great opposition. The Branch servant was arrested more than a year ago and was taken into protective custody by the government for the duration of the war. Terrible punishment was meted out against this brother, and, because of very bad health, due to his imprisonment, arrangements were finally made for what is called a “house arrest” and he was allowed to live at home, but could not communicate with any person other than those in his immediate family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to latest reports, the work continues to move ahead there, but our brethren endure great persecution. Many of our brethren are marked for persecution, and when they are found they are beaten and thrown into jail and ill-treated in every manner. Throughout all these difficulties the organization has been held intact. We still have a head office and, even though the Branch servant has been taken away, a new one has been appointed and the work continues. The newspapers throughout the country are forbidden to write anything about Jehovah’s witnesses, for fear that someone may hear of them and want to learn what they teach. Therefore everything is kept quiet. Just a few weeks ago a report came through for fourteen months’ activity of our brethren in Finland, and it shows that 1,123 publishers have been engaging in the field work up until last June, over this period mentioned, and have placed 67,496 books and booklets. In this period of fourteen months these 1,123 publishers have spent 93,227 hours in the field. From latest reports, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine are still distributed and during the year 18,000 new subscriptions were obtained. Back-calls are playing an important part in the work, and 24,899 of these were made. The brethren in Finland are putting up a valiant fight, and, by the Lord’s grace, the truth and “meat in due season” gets into that land and is republished in their own language for the benefit of all. It is only by the Lord’s grace and through his help that these things are accomplished. It is hoped that some day these brethren may be free again to comfort those who have come under the heel of totalitarian rule.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Last year the report from Sweden was too late to publish in its completion. Therefore this year’s report includes fifteen months rather than twelve. The Society’s branch is located at Stockholm, Sweden, and from there the work throughout that country is directed. All communication is carried on by air mail. By the Lord’s grace, good work has been accomplished during the year. The servant of the Branch sends in the following report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service figures show that these people of good-will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">do </span><span class="font4">come and join the ranks of those who serve and fight under the banner of the glorious King of kings. During the period under consideration the highest number in the field service during any one month was 2,571, reached during the month of August, 1943. When we remember that as recently as the beginning of March, 1942, we were striving to reach a total of 2,000 publishers, this will be seen to be a very encouraging increase. These publishers spent 616,518 hours in the field, to compare with 537,923 for the previous period of fifteen months, and placed a total of 90,927 books and 619,578 booklets in the hands of the people, as well as 664,575 copies of the magazines, taking also 21,535 new subscriptions. These figures for literature spread do not compare so favorably with the figures for the corresponding previous period, and this may be largely due to the fact that no new book has been published, while only two new booklets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font4"> have appeared. Although all the pages of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font4"> have been dispatched to us, we have not received any portion of the book. However, we know that if the Lord’s will Is that this shall be published, we shall in his due time receive a copy for translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been a great encouragement to see the increase in the number of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> from 6,646, at the beginning of the period, to 8,185 at its close. This may not appear a very high total when compared with the subscription list in America, or with the number of subscribers for our issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> but in this country the contribution asked for a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is more than double that asked for one for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> (which magazine appears only once a month), which has a circulation seven times as high as that of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been an increase in back-calls corresponding to the increase in publishers, with a total of 162,014. Owing to the change in the method of reporting book studies and attendance, it is not possible to give these figures for the whole period. Practically all of the book studies are a result of back-calls, but a few have been arranged by the companies as such, and it has not been possible to separate these figures. A total of 3,765 book studies were reported</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">during the months February 1943 to August 1943 inclusive, and an average of 538 different study groups each month, which were attended by an average of 2,282 persons each month, the total attendance reported being 15,973. As the “new interest” figures have not as yet had time to be reported, the latter figure represents all of those actually present at the studies. There are no book-study figures for the months February to August 1942 with which to compare, but those for model studies, as were then reported, compare very favorably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the fifteen months 223 different persons were on the pioneer list, but not all of these were able to continue in the service. The highest number reporting during any one month was 198, including 43 special pioneers, which peak was reached in August, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total number of companies organized for witnessing is 360, which is considerably more than when we last reported (135). This increase is largely due to the fact that many isolated publishers have now been formed into companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three servants to the brethren have been serving these companies since early in 1943. This special service has proved to be a very timely provision by the Lord. One brother, who was absent on business when the servant visited his company, afterwards said that, when he came back shortly after the visit, he seemed to meet an altogether new company, all of the brethren having been enthused and encouraged by the help given by the servant to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection I should mention also the. new set of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> which we received last autumn, and Introduced to the brethren during the set of conventions around the New Year season. These instructions have proved to be most helpful in stabilizing the companies and making all and sundry see their personal responsibility in caring for the Kingdom interests. The Izird has graciously made us appreciate the need for constantly, patiently and persistently looking after the new interest, and also has given us encouragement in that we see the “other sheep” gradually coming along, although at times it seems that they are rather slow in making up their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Owing to the fact that we have not had so many new items of literature to offer when we go over the field time and time again, the placements tend to decrease in number, but we hope to get some new publications one fine day. During the period covered by this report we have made reprints of the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> (30,000) and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> (75,000). Another 50,000 edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> is being printed for us on the Society’s press at Helsingfors. In order to repudiate some false charges made against us, we adopted a resolution at the September, 1942, convention, which was printed at the end of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> No. 11, and one million copies of this were distributed during the first months of 1943. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> No. 12 was released at our convention just held, and will be extensively used in the future. Of the new booklets mentioned earlier in this report, we printed 500,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> and 350,000 of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font4"> Of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> giving instructions to the field publishers, 68,980 copies were sent out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sound work has been carried on during the fifteen months with the aid of 11 loud-speaker outfits mounted on bicycle trailers, and approximately 800 phonographs, and lectures have been reproduced to 323,344 persons, which total Is slightly higher than for the previous&quot; period, when the number was 304,378.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Memorial feast last April was attended by 574 more than last year, the total being 3,193. Those partaking of the emblems totaled 429, which was 23 less than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the three sets of conventions held, the first, in September, 1942, arranged at five different places in the country, was attended by 2,040. The second set, which, as already mentioned, was held around the New Year to introduce the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> assembled in six different localities and was attended by 1,945 friends. The last convention, held during August 20-22, was spread over ten different places, and 3,147 attended. At these conventions a total of 645 symbolized their consecration to Jehovah and his righteous New World by being immersed in water. From letters received at this office after the last convention I quote the following extracts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The attendance at this place was greater than expected, making the hall almost too small to accommodate aii who had assembled. One newly interested man from the country, attending a convention for the first time, said, when he found the hall filled to overflowing: ‘And the priests say that there are hardly any who work for The Theocracy 1’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is certainly not overdoing it to say that such a great crowd of joyful persons have never before met in the town hall. People who sat in the park outside the hall were heard to express their astonishment when they saw all the bright faces. This convention was especially a convention of youth, and our publishers, who were to be seen everywhere, gave quite a touch of color to the whole outdoor life of the town. When two Salvation Army officers of high rank passed one of the publishers, one of them said: ‘They verily stand at every corner!’ The youngest publisher on the streets was a bonny little girlie four years of age, who aroused general interest. Next in age came two boys of six, a girl of ten, and so on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Office Staff. As the work, and the number of organized companies and pioneers, have steadily increased, the work in the office has also of necessity been greater, and has kept the staff very busy all through the year, often making evening work necessary. The members of the staff have nevertheless found opportunity to take part in the field service, and an average of 17 per month have spent 5,934 hours in this way, placing 9,510 pieces of literature, taking 517 subscriptions, and playing lectures to 1,451 persons, as well as conducting book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one looks back upon the period covered in the above report and thinks of the efforts made by the opposer to discredit and hinder the Theocratic work, there is very great reason for gratitude to Jehovah, who has maneuvered all to his glory. In spite of the disturbed conditions all around us, we have been enabled also to receive with more or less regularity the food the Lord provides for his people In the pages of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and have also been privileged to pass this on to our brethren in more benighted areas. For all this we praise Jehovah and give thanks to the Most High, and pray that he may grant us power and wisdom to fight on against the vile attacks by the enraged demons until victory is finally won by Christ Jesus, the valiant Fighter for the righteous New World. We also pray that Jehovah’s rich grace and strength may be given you day by day in your most important service, and I beg to express oui- gratitude for the courageous lead in making an uncompromising stand for the New World which has been given us through you.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Complete freedom is not granted to the servants of Jehovah in South Africa. There is a ban on the importation of literature, and much literature already sent there has been kept in storage and has not been permitted through to the Branch office. This holding up of literature has been reflected in the distribution of books and booklets, as far as the South African report is concerned, it being much less than in previous years. This has not retarded the witness, however, because in this land we find that during 1943 there was a great increase in the number of publishers engaging in the field service and in the amount of time that was put in by these publishers. The report for 1942 for all of South Africa, which includes the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasa-land, Portuguese East Africa, and St. Helena, shows that there were 6,175 publishers. Now, in 1943, there are 8,221. These 8,221 publishers have put in 2,871,787 hours, which is an increase of almost a million hours over the previous year. There are 565 companies organized throughout all this area, an increase of 91 over the previous year. This shows that these people are anxious to hear the truth and, with more workers in the field, a greater witness can be accomplished and the people of good-will found more quickly, and thus the increase is shown in the report for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in this territory have not made this progress without opposition. They have progressed and defeated persecution by their faithful service and maintaining of integrity. The report from the servant at the Branch is quite comprehensive, and is set out below for the various countries under the central branch located at Cape Town:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The stirring “Go Ahead” signal in the early part of the year followed by the unfolding of the Jephthah’s daughter picture was a great incentive to all fighters for the New World. Such have carried forward a vigorous campaign resisting all “Ammonite” encroachments and have fought valiantly to maintain the true worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the time has come when the Lord is gathering his “other sheep” and that there are many of such in this part of the earth has been clearly manifest during the past twelve months. In obedience to the Lord’s command the search has gone on in the cities and dorps, in the highways and byways. Lonely farmers on the veld and others living in almost inaccessible places have not been overlooked. The Kingdom message has gone forth and found a responsive chord in many an honest heart, and such ones are saying, “Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the face of increased difficulties the work has gone ahead, and It Is a real joy to advise there are now 10,000 publishers reporting to the South African office. There has been an average each month of 8,221 active in the service. Tills represents an Increase of 2,04G over last year's figure. Time spent in the field reflects an increase of 883,249 hours; back-calls and model studies are in excess of those made the previous year to the extent of 67,310. It will be seen from the individual reports that the greatest progress has been made in the Union of South Africa; but conditions generally have been more favorable in this country than in the lands to the north, and that fact should be had in mind when making comparisons.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Although the actual distribution of literature is greatly curtailed these days, due to lack of supplies, a more effective witness has been given during the past year than ever before. As has been our custom for a number of years, we aimed for a 25-percent increase of publishers; and once again, by the Lord’s grace, it has been according to our faith ; and He gave an even greater increase. The peak of publishers went up from 1,582 to 2,126, representing an increase of 34 percent, and the monthly average improved from 1,357 to 1,837. The lack of adequate supplies is most keenly felt by the pioneer publishers; but the Lord has made it possible for these front-line fighters to hold their own and the monthly average Increased from 62 to 69 pioneers. The time spent in the field shot up from 386,764 hours to 597,478. Special pioneer publishers averaged 165 hours; general pioneers, 141; and company publishers, 22.4. Last year the pioneers averaged 136 hours; and the company publishers, 18.4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Publication. During the year we were able to get supplies in both English and Afrikaans of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font4">study question booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope, Peace—Can It Lastt</span><span class="font4"> ‘Convention Report,’ and a special booklet setting forth the Society’s reply to the objections raised against the literature. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font4"> with questions, is being published in five parts. Parts 1-3 are now in circulation, and the remaining two parts will be published shortly. Model Study “Questions and Answers” have been prepared in Cinyanja, Sesuto, Zulu, and Xosa. These provisions have been most timely and, together with the regular magazines, not only have nourished and strengthened us but have also enabled us to feed the Lord’s “other sheep” with the sustaining food now coming forth from the Lord’s storehouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the regular campaign the company publishers, due to shortage of literature, continue to loan the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font4">for a period of three weeks, calling each week with a question folder and endeavoring to conduct a model study. If good interest is manifest and there is a real desire to keep the book or to commence a detailed study at the end of the three-week period, arrangements are made accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Covering the territory in advance with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font4"> as outlined in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> has helped prepare the ground in a wonderful way and has on many occasions resulted in a hearing being given where formerly one was met with a definite “no interest”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back-Calls and Model Studies. In a sparsely populated far-flung country such as this, making of regular back-calls is a difficult matter in the best of times. In these days of petrol rationing it is doubly so. But as the importance and necessity of this part of the work has become more apparent many more are overcoming the obstacles and difficulties, with the result that there has been a great increase in the number of return visits. In all, 148,995 back-calls were made, of which number 69,722 were model studies. The corresponding figures for the previous year were 83,102 back-calls and 27,495 model studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Book Studies. Publishers’ back-call book studies have also gone ahead. At one time some of the publishers appeared to be of the opinion that the holding of several model studies was all that was required to determine the issue. Now the majority appreciate the fact that the detailed book study is the best method of all for giving systematic instruction and building up interest. Accordingly there has been a better effort made to establish such studies. Much remains to be done, and there is still scope for plenty of improvement. There is still a feeling of incompetency on the part of many publishers, and, while it is true that we would all benefit tremendously by a course of intensified training, yet the provision already made of the question booklet, etc., should be ample for the weakest and feeblest to go right ahead with their commission to “feed my sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Companies that have organized and developed the group study arrangement have made good progress, and we look forward to a greater extension of this feature of the organization in the coming year. The group studies are now busy on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font4"> and are deriving great help therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Obganization. The new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> reached us at the end of 1942 and became effective in this country February 1. These have been of great assistance In helping us to organize the work more effectively. The three servants to the brethren have completed their first round, traveling 13,040 miles. Their visits have been greatly appreciated. The desire of all is to co-operate wholeheartedly in furthering the Kingdom interests. The House to House form is in the six principal languages of this country and has been useful in training us to keep a proper record of the work done. On the veld and in the country districts generally, where the homes are not numbered, we still have to rely on our notebooks, but these are now kept in line with the form and a record made of each of the four visits. There is much still to be done in the work of organization, but the natural dislike of filling in forms, noticeable particularly in the country districts, is gradually being overcome and the publishers are appreciating more fully the need for same. As they come into line their service becomes more efficient and the Ix&gt;rd’s blessing more marked with the corresponding increase which always follows 100-percent co-operation with Theocratic requirements. The special pioneer publishers and general pioneers have done well, and company organizations have increased from 176 to 194.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assemblies. In September we shared in the New World Assembly. There were 10 assembly points, with a record attendance of 2,296, practically ail of whom were persons sincerely interested in The Theocracy. Although there were numerous assembly points many friends still had to travel quite a distance to be present. Many of those recently contacted have already seen their privilege of serving the great Theocrat, and no fewer than 338 persons symbolized their consecration to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the outstanding events of the South African assemblies was the release of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope.</span><span class="font4"> For the first time in this country a publication was released simultaneously in English and Afrikaans. ‘Hope for the dead and for survivors in a righteous world’—what a message for the heralds of the New World! With hope in their hearts and this glorious message of comfort and hope on their lips and in their hands the valiant fighters for the New World went forth to ‘comfort those that mourn’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the instructional features opportunity was given for field experiences, and two of these are set out below as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Identified by Phono. A witness knocked at a door and a voice called, “Come in.” Knocking again, the voice again said, “Come in.” Entering, he saw no one but was invited by the voice into another room and saw a woman in bed. He hesitated and apologized, but was invited to sit down, as she wanted to know all about the Kingdom. She had seen him come up the path from her window and knew that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, as he was carrying the phonograph. She took the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> gladly, and arrangements were made for a return visit for a model study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“After Many Days.” A publisher told of how he contacted a couple who had taken </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> from him six years before and had lost touch with our work for all those years, much to their disappointment. Did chance bring the publisher to the door of these “other sheep” after so many years, or was it the guidance of the Good Shepherd? A model study was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">April Assembly. We only heard about your April arrangements in May, but we had arranged a united assembly for </span><span class="font4">that month in Johannesburg. The program was in line with your September program, and all present voted it the best yet. Traveling difficulties made it difficult for all to attend who otherwise would have done so. In the circumstances an attendance of 1,200 brethren was remarkable. Practically every company in the Union was represented, six were present from Southern Rhodesia, one Greek evacuee sister from Cairo, and one brother who left Singapore a day or two before it fell. At the public meeting 1,500 were present, the hall accommodation being taxed to its utmost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The high spot of this assembly was “A Message from the President”, outlining the growth of the Lord’s visible organization and stressing the importance of faithful service. Extracts from the annual report and the first news of Gilead were received with great enthusiasm, as were the various discourses. The new Bible and vertical phonograph were exhibited and explained. They gave the assembled brethren a real thrill. Great was our joy as we gazed upon these latest provisions of the Lord and at the handiwork of our brethren at headquarters. We could scarcely be blamed for having a slight tinge of regret in not being able to use these instruments immediately, but our joy in the knowledge that our brethren in America were alreadj’ using them and that we too would have that privilege in due season more than compensated for any temporary pang of disappointment. As usual, many others benefited In addition to those attending the assembly. In all, 1,022 publishers shared in the field service and 6,272 books, booklets and magazines containing the message of God's kingdom were placed in the hands of the people of Johannesburg. The total time spent by the publishers in this work totaled 6,317 hours. Back-calls on interested people numbered 494, and at 76 of these model studies were conducted; and 600 new names were handed in to the service department during the week-end. Those immersed numbered 209.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assembly at Cape Town. We wound up the service year with an assembly at Cape Town the last week-end of July. This was a local assembly for the friends in Cape Town and district. There were 202 publishers in action, an increase of 60 on our previous peak. The main feature was a public meeting in the City Hall at which 800 listened to the talk on “Peace—Can It Last?” Excellent interest was manifest </span><span class="font4">and the advertising served to let the whole of Cape Town know that Jehovah’s witnesses were not only a going concern but that they had a message of vital importance for them. This was the most successful public meeting we have had in Cape Town in the past twenty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Repeated efforts have been made during the year to obtain the release of the literature held at the docks, but all such efforts have thus far proved unavailing. We have had no considered reply to our written representations and the promise to give us an opportunity to make oral representations has not been honored. However, whatever the difficulties our commission remains unaltered and we have moved right on in full harmony with the terms thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been thrilling to us here to see the work expand and grow. Twenty years ago there were less than 40 publishers in the Union and no proper organization. Today there are upward of 2,000 publishers and 194 company organizations all rejoicing in and magnifying Theocratic rule. The Lord has given this increase and we rejoice as we see the “Jephthah’s daughter” class come forward and share In the temple service. Now that the foundations have been laid we look forward to co-operating in the building program and to the greater multitude that will yet find their way to Zion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The work of proclaiming the message of The Theocracy continues to go forward in Southern Rhodesia. During the past year there was a monthly average of 1,090 publishers, to compare with 617 the previous year. They spent 271,155 hours in Kingdom service, or a monthly average of 20.7 per publisher, to compare with 158,836 the previous year; and made return visits totaling 62,446, which gives a monthly average of 5. Back-calls last year totaled 38,221. Persecution has been defeated In that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An African brother acts as a servant to the brethren, and his visits have been of great help to the companies throughout the country. The account of his journeys reminds one at times of the experience of Paul and others. In a report just to hand he writes: “We traveled with much hardship. That country abounds with wild beasts, and is therefore not safe. But Jehovah, whose power is illimitable, went before us and we were safe in every traveling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">African Fbiends. A year ago arrangements were made for an African brother to devote his full time as a servant. He has visited companies throughout the territory during the period and has done good work in encouraging, organizing and establishing unity. The greater part of the work in Southern Rhodesia is carried on by Africans and shows steady increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Occasionally in some districts companies gather together for a few days and in partnership proclaim the Kingdom message over a wide area. These gatherings have been a source of joy and encouragement to the friends. They work zealously bearing the Kingdom message, and often in the face of strong opposition. Religionists continue to appeal to compound managers, mine managers and native commissioners, seeking to halt the Lord’s army and to stop the encroachment on their pastures, but their efforts have been in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In November last a company over a hundred strong began work in one of the largest compounds in the colony, preaching the Kingdom message from house to house in their usual orderly way. “Locusts” operating in such numbers strike terror and panic into the practitioners of religion. The following morning these religionists appeared at the office of the compound manager appealing to him to deal with the ‘plague of locusts’. The manager called for the servants and threatened to sign off all Jehovah’s witnesses if they continued. The following week-end, however, despite the efforts of the religionists and the threats of the manager, the friends continued the work and finished it. The manager did nothing. Though the religionists and their allies fume and bluster, the Lord’s people courageously continue, giving no ground to the enemy, but press on in the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some overseers of Africans have been honest men and have informed the religionists they can find no harm in the witnesses. Others again have caused the witnesses to lose their means of livelihood, which has forced them to leave the district. The scattering resulting from this persecution has caused the Kingdom message to be carried into new territory and bearing fruit has brought forth praise to the Lord’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No reports were received here during Rie year of any imprisonments or confiscation of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eubopean Wobk. Despite threats and opposition, the witnesses have moved forward steadily and fearlessly, instructing those of good-will, which has resulted in a substantial increase that has joined to swell the song of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In January two publishers in the course of witnessing were reported to the authorities, who charged them the following month with using words which were calculated to foment opposition to the successful prosecution of the war. The case which was heard before the magistrate at Bulawayo disclosed that the evidence of the Roman Catholics responsible for the false charge was both contradictory and unreliable and the friends were discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cape Colobed. There is a small number of Cape Coloreds in the colony. The colored community in general is much under the influence and power of religionists, but in December two friends took their stand on the side of Jehovah and his King and symbolized this by water immersion. Immediately thereafter a powerful religious organization took action by sending its “sisters” from house to house in the colored community, not to proclaim the good news of God’s kingdom, but to warn their parishioners of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses who were so doing. This resulted in two further friends symbolizing their love for and desire to serve the Lord. A company of these friends has now been formed, and they joyfully and zealously go forth bearing the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Although without literature explaining the Bible the publishers in Northern Rhodesia have made good use of the “sword of the spirit” and have proclaimed the good news of God’s kingdom by word of mouth. Questions and answers with related scriptures have been prepared for them, and with the help of such they have been able to carry forward their study meetings with much profit to themselves and to others. The depot servant has not been without his difficulties, but, unlike last year, he has been free to carry forward his duties without interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year there has been a monthly average of 12 servants to the brethren and 2,772 company publishers, an increase of 655 publishers over last year’s figure. Their hours of field service totaled 1,138,937, giving a monthly average of 144 for the pioneers and 33.6 for the company publishers. Back-calls were made to the number of 42,997. Pioneers averaged 14; and company publishers, 1.3. The figures for last year were 22,008. Company organizations total 180, to compare with 138 a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The depot servant in his report writes as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The banning of the Society’s literature and records three years ago has brought in its wake many serious difficulties. Not only has the supply been entirely cut off, but even last November thirteen Africans in one district were sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment with hard labor for being found in possession of one or more booklets, and neither the chief justice nor the chief secretary was prepared to take the necessary steps to have this punishment, ordered by a junior magistrate, reduced. Many cases with smaller sentences have been reported, and even the governor’s chef was put into prison for the same reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In a large near-by district, at the Instigation of officials the local chiefs refused to permit quiet Bible study meetings or even witnessing; and this has also resulted in several cases’ being brought against Jehovah’s witnesses for carrying out their God-given commission to ‘assemble yourselves together’ and to testify to the gospel message of comfort and hope which the Kingdom of God through Christ will bring to mankind. When in prison some of these boys were given no blankets at all to cover themselves, nor were they supplied with prison clothes, when others were provided with these things, and discrimination was even carried to the extent of food’s being permitted from outside for other prisoners but not for Jehovah’s witnesses, who were fed in a different group. A government investigation by the commissioner of prisons brought forth a denial of these facts which we are well able to establish, but this can only be explained by lying on the part of the African warders or the Europeans in charge of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The inability of the majority of Africans in the bush, and even on the railhead, to read with understanding, or even to read at all, in any of the different vernaculars in which the Bible or parts of It have been translated presents a problem which only time can overcome; and while everything possible is being done by the full-time workers to visit the centers with increasing regularity, the harvest is great but the laborers are few. They are small in number because It Is hard to obtain a sufficient number of those that are Scrip-turally qualified who are willing to make the sacrifice which this particular arduous work involves. The villages are scattered ; the roads between them are paths which are almost impassable during the wet season, and during last year the food was far from plentiful. The desire to learn is there; and the spirit to serve too, but time and patience are necessary before anything like an understanding can be obtained which can be relied upon to act with discretion under the circumstances in which primitive village life is carried on. In addition, the Labor Corps has absorbed a large number and its members are constantly on the move from place to place; from farm to farm, with groups returning home and others substituting them, and this makes constant contact extremely difficult. It Is of interest to record that in spite of much prejudice and ill report, started so often by those who should know better, the Society’s adherents have the best reputation of any in this Corps and it is well known that farmers and other employers specify that they specially want them; they like these Africans who prefer to work in their own clothes and use their own blankets to using those provided by the government. They work in their own gangs with one of Jehovah’s witnesses in charge, and their cleanness, diligent work and general conduct have been outstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As for the back-calls, about 1 in 2J participate in the work. Tliis may seem extraordinary but I really think that were you up here you would understand the reason. It is possible that even now a large number of those who have attended the studies for years have only a hazy idea of who Christ is and even the simplest Scriptural expression is a meaningless collection of words which may or may not be repeated like a parrot by the majority. I myself have taken studies here for six years and do not know of one woman who even now has what would be called an intelligent understanding of the Bible. On the Copper Belt there are exceptional cases where there is some ability and a desire to use it but with almost all women unable to read at all; Bibles now almost unprocurable, and men in the villages in much the same state, it is not the refusal to serve the Lord in an active way—that desire is there—but the stark reality that these poor people have little or no understanding of time, history or the ability to read the Bible in its simplest passages and take from them the plain meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Here at the depot we are kept extremely busy. More than 1,000 people have visited us, and the servants to the brethren have covered about 7,000 miles and taken studies, etc., with approximately 11,000 people. The incoming letters are approximately 3,520; and the outgoing approximately 4,600. Every effort has been put forth to inculcate in the minds of the friends the need for proper respect for European and African authority and the avoidance of interference with the war activities of the government, and, generally speaking, there has been little trouble with the government over Africans who have failed in this respect.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In this country, as in the others in this part of the earth, the number of publishers engaging in the witness work has increased. The monthly average went up from 1,973 to 2,464; the hours, from 729,065 to 858,053. Pioneers averaged 160; and company publishers, 28.8. Back-calls show a decrease, however. This is due mainly to the fact that the Cinyanja records became completely worn out in the early part of the service year. Most of the women in that country are illiterate, and while they formerly were able to make return visits to play records, not being able to read they are unable to carry forward model studies in an orderly manner. This resulted in the number making back-calls being reduced to about one-third of the total publishers. Under the circumstances the average of 3.3 back-calls per publisher is remarkably good. Efforts are being made to organize the back-call work more effectively in that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The company organizations have increased from 117 to 144.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toward the end of the service year a new governor was appointed. He formerly served in Roman Catholic Basutoland. A new commissioner of police hailing from West Africa was also appointed, and, shortly thereafter, on June 25, Government Notice No. 77 announced a total ban on the importation of all the Society’s publications. The ban, however, does not affect distribution of stocks in the country. Thus Nyasaland, which country for nearly four years stood firm against religious pressure to ban the importation of the Kingdom message, has now lined up with her neighbors and doubtless earned the plaudits of the “old lady”. There is, of course, not the slightest justification for the action taken, and Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to march forward under the banner of their King preaching and showing the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Reports still filter through now and again from Portuguese East Africa. There are at least 52 active publishers in Portuguese East Africa. Such reports as we have received indicate they have spent 5,909 hours in field service, an average of 22.4 per month, and made 726 back-calls, an average of 2.8.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">One report covering the first three months of the year was received. This gave 13 publishers in action, 10 books and 86 booklets placed, and 102 back-calls, of which 100 were model studies. Subsequent letters suggest that the publishers in that island are now in regular touch with headoffice and making their reports direct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of helpers in the office has again been 9. Increasing work in the field adds to our work here, but with a spirit of willing co-operation we get through, by the Lord’s grace. The new organization setup, the routing of servants, preparation of servant’s reports and checking up on these and the Company Information forms when they come back, has increased our work in the office. The dispatch desk handled 2,567 orders, to compare with 2,255 the previous year. The subscription desk handled 1,945 new subscriptions and 963 renewals, a total of 2,908, to compare with 1,374 the previous year. We received 9,188 letters and sent out 10,233. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font4"> and circular letters totaled 15,886. Increasing paper difficulties (there has been no newsprint received in this country for 15 months now) have prevented us from doing all we would like to do, but the printing room has turned out 120,022 magazines, 53,045 booklets, 13,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informants,</span><span class="font4"> 180,800 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> (Nos. 10 and 11) in English, Afrikaans, and Xosa; 800 Calendars, and 427,820 publicmeeting leaflets, service slips, office forms, etc. An outside firm ran off 20,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kinders</span><span class="font4"> [Afrikaans </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children] </span><span class="font4">and 50,000 copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> booklet in English and Afrikaans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As usual, we have kept busy in the field in the evenings when not required to work inside, and at week-ends. We have averaged 30 hours each per month, 11 back-calls, and 5 studies. In addition, the “F.C.” study and 5 of the district group book studies in Cape Town are conducted by office brethren each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We all had the privilege of attending the Johannesburg convention, and that was a season of rich blessing and stimulus to us. Above all, however, we are truly grateful for all the help and loving encouragement we have received from you during the course of the year. Your ceaseless and untiring efforts to keep us fully informed in all that we need to know have been greatly appreciated. We have had an abundance of spiritual food from the Lord’s table, and this has been both satisfying and energizing and has given us strength for the battle. We hope that when things are more normal you will be able to spare the time to pay us a visit. In the meantime be assured of the love, good wishes and prayers of all the brethren in this land on your behalf. The news of the recent great Theocratic victories in America has thrilled us greatly and spurs us on to redouble our efforts here. Our prayer for you is, as it is for ourselves, that you may all be “more than conquerors through him that loved us”, and live to see the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The local government of this island made some concessions during the year and allowed the importation of certain publications. The Society immediately took advantage of this and made shipment. Thus we find in Trinidad an increase in the distribution of literature during 1943 over that of 1942; also an increase in publishers. Not all the literature, by any means, was allowed to enter, but the few publications on which permission was granted gave sufficient instruments for our brethren to work with, and thus the work moved ahead. There were 279 publishers in the field, to compare with 234 last year, and these publishers distributed 23,525 pieces of literature. Jehovah’s witnesses on the island made 1,725 back-calls, and it is believed that during the coming year more attention will be given to this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The servant in Trinidad makes the following report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In making annual report I am glad to be able to state that the work is continuing to the honor of Jehovah’s name and that there seems to be an increase of interest in the message of the kingdom of Christ. This probably is largely due to the time spent in back-calls and back-call studies, and was manifest at the August convention assemblies; for both in the islands of Barbados and Trinidad the numbers exceeded those we have had before, despite the fact that at Barbados all the literature (including old magazines from the homes of the brethren) has been placed, and censorship prevents more from entering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, two brethren here at Trinidad were prosecuted for having Watch Tower publications In possession, same being prohibited by law. In each case a policeman had been present while one of Brother Rutherford’s recorded speeches was being delivered by talking machine. One of the two was fined $240 with the alternative of four months’ imprisonment. During the hearing of the case he told the magistrate that he makes no apology for having such publications in his possession; he gave a good testimony in court as well as later on, in prison. When repeatedly asked by the magistrate how he would pay the fine, meaning that the court expected that he would do that, and would spread the payment over a period of time, receiving it by installments, the brother each time replied, I am not paying any money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The figures show a good increase in literature placed, for we had received some; also increases in publishers, back-calls, and back-call studies, yet there is room for much improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you are aware, the government here has refused permission for the import of the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font4"> Besides the Bible only some old publications which have already been widely circulated are allowed. Hours spent in the field service are fewer, but I think that most of the time spent in back-call studies has not been reported. A fair number of people have attended these, but the great majority do not keep on. However, some are progressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In tlie islands mentioned, as well as in others where there are brethren, regular meetings for Bible study are held, and some witnessing done, but the difficulty in all Is scarcity of literature; this, no doubt, the Lord permits in the meantime for some good purpose and will fix in his due time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>BARBADOS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This island comes under the supervision of the Branch servant in Trindad, and the brethren there have done as much as they possibly could. As is reported above, the brethren even took their old magazines from their homes and distributed them among the people of good-will, using this means to carry on the work. Fifty-six publishers carried on the service in this island, putting in 5,169 hours. This is over a thousand hours more than last year, with fewer workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Barbados the brethren enjoyed a convention in February, having 367 present. Again in August they joined the world-wide Assembly, and had 475 at their principal meeting. This shows that there is much interest on the island, and that the publishers there are doing good work in keeping alive the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The territory covered by the West African branch includes the Gold Coast, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Many years have passed since any literature of the Society for field distribution has entered into that country, but this has not dampened the zeal on the part of the brethren there. Jehovah’s witnesses in these territories press on with joy and gladness, realizing that the persecution and opposition brought against them is of the Devil and his organization, and that he is trying to break down their integrity. These African brethren delight to do the Lord’s will, and they do not forsake the assembling of themselves together. Having little literature to use, it has proved valuable for the brethren to come together more often than in other countries, so that they might communicate one to another the information by word of mouth; and thus they receive a rich blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not so long ago the “Christian” nations were astonished at the Bible destruction that took place in Spain, when the order was given to grind 110,000 Bibles into pulp to be used for other purposes. However, very little noise or comment is made about the burning of 250,000 volumes of Christian literature, which was done recently in West Africa. One newspaper set out the headlines, “Bonfire Is Made of 250,000 Volumes of Jehovah’s witnesses Books and Pamphlets.” Part of the article reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About 250,000 copies of pamphlets and books belonging to the local branch of Jehovah’s witnesses, confiscated last year, have, it is understood, been ordered to be burnt and actually been destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is understood the burning took three days, the scene being at the Lagos Town Council incinerators at Epstedo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford’s publications had had unrestricted circulation in Nigeria for nearly 20 years and only last year government considered it necessary as war measure to ban the works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A large number of volumes of the books were confiscated and the impression was that they would be released after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. W. R. Brown, local missioner for Jehovah’s witnesses, when interviewed yesterday, said: ... if there was objection to their circulation here he ought to have been permitted to reship the books back to the United States where the headquarters of the organization resides.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Service </span><span class="font4">(official organ of the Nigerian Youth Movement), Lagos, Wednesday, July 28, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another edition carried the headline, “Burning of the Jehovah’s witnesses’ Publications”; and the article said the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report that over 250,000 books and pamphlets belonging to Lagos branch of the Jehovah’s witness organization have been ordered to be burnt and actually been destroyed has aroused strong feeling of disapproval even among those who have never had any friendly feeling In the past towards the Bible Tract Society and its somewhat aggressive literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The value of the books destroyed, we understand, is in the neighborhood of £60,000 and It might have been hoped that if government objected to their circulation in this country, the Jehovah’s witness’ local agent should at least have been permitted to ship them back to America, where they are known still to enjoy free circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The destruction of these books Is entirely unjustifiable. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">•—The Daily Service</span><span class="font4"> (official organ of the Nigerian Youth Movement), Lagos, Wednesday, July 28, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the above it is seen that even the newspapermen and the local public itself were astonished at the course of action taken by the government. This shows that some rulers are fearful of the truth, for ‘the truth shall make the people free’, and certainly those in authority in British West Africa do not want the natives of that country to be free. However, the Lord in his own due time will free these good people and maybe before Armageddon will give them further opportunity of hearing and reading the truth so that they can take their stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report from the Branch servant in West Africa is most interesting, and portions thereof are set out below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the Lord’s grace, we are sending this report covering our activities in West Africa (Gold Coast and Nigeria) for the year 1943. The bounteous blessings of Jehovah God on our efforts are causes for us to rejoice in him and ever to thank and praise his holy name.—Ps. 92:1.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to the outbreak of war, the importation of our literature has long been prohibited in this country. With the war on, the Devil had a chance of further persecuting the brethren through his representatives. Some were jailed, while others fled away from the persecution. The Devil went further by getting in with a brother who, becoming lawless, caused considerable confusion among the brethren but repented later of his lawlessness when a brother was sent from here to straighten affairs. The Branch servant Is still not permitted to enter the country. Through an interview with the governor when he came to act as governor of Nigeria, permission for him to enter was asked but again refused. We are glad, however, to report that the work on the Gold Coast is progressing. There are about 300 brethren, with an average of 240 publishers per month. According to reports received, the brethren during the year have put in a total of 13,602 hours, making a total of 538 back-calls.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren in this country are rejoicing greatly for the wonderful privilege they have in bearing and testifying to the name of Jehovah, the Most High. Amidst great difficulties and oppositions, the work has continued to the dismay of all enemies of righteousness. When our books were seized by the government two years ago, some brethren thought that the “strange work” had ended; but they soon realized it had not. Having been properly instructed, they have continued to go from house to house with their Bibles, comforting those of good-will that mourn, and making back-calls on those who show some interest. The importance of back-call work and that of book studies is more realized by the brethren than before. This is borne out by the fact that a total of 14,372 back-calls were made this year, against 4,668, the total for last year. The mouths of those who have been branding us as “booksellers”, “hawkers,” etc., are now stopped (1 Pet. 2:15), and those who “hear” are also participating in inviting others to “come”. (Rev. 22:17) The brethren’s determination is to continue on in the “strange work” until Jehovah, not the Devil, says it is enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As “fishers of men”, one of the baits used to carry on the “fishing” is the general assembly of brethren in a campaign of thoroughly combing out a territory. These assemblies are arranged in many places all over the two countries; some taking place monthly, and some every two months. At every such assembly the office is represented, many being attended and personally supervised by the Branch servant. Conventions are similarly arranged and have been held in 14 different places during the year. The 15th and the greatest yet was the one of August 20, 21 and 22, which was held in five centers In Nigeria with a total attendance of 4,445, and, in the one center on the Gold Coast, with an attendance of 320. A great joy filled every heart at this “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, especially when realizing that our brethren throughout the earth were assembled at the same time giving praises to Jehovah. In Nigeria, handbills reproducing “Glorious Earth” and “Refuse Not Him That Speak-eth from Heaven” were printed in English and in Yoruba and distributed during the convention. We have really felt the Lord’s blessings on the assemblies. Following is the Declaration adopted by all the witnesses in Nigeria at the Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“declabation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“More than four thousand Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in five principal towns in Nigeria, namely, Aba, Abeokuta, Akure, Warri, and Zaria, at a Theocratic Convention held on the 20, 21 and 22 August, 1943, declare their purpose to continue to witness to the establishment of the Theocratic Kingdom of Almighty God, and to maintain their integrity in the commission given to them by Jehovah, as stated at Isaiah 61:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We affirm our faith in the Holy Scriptures as the Word of God, and our fullest confidence in the unfolding of his prophecies given to us for our salvation and for his service in these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We recognize that Jehovah, through his beloved Son Christ Jesus, has chosen Brother Nathan H. Knorr as his servant of his earthly organization, and we declare that we are one-hundred-percent, wholeheartedly and joyfully in harmony with him in every step he takes in carrying out the privileges and great responsibilities of his office as president of the Society, in an effort to serve Jehovah; and we rejoice in the privilege of continuing to march with Jehovah’s irresistible army (Joel 2:1-11) clear through the glorious portals of the New World to complete victory in this great fight for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We declare our conviction that Jehovah, the great Theo-crat, has already set his King upon his holy hill of Zion (Ps. 2:6) and that Jehovah is now bringing the nations of the earth to his judgments (Joel 3:2; Zech. 14:2) ; also that by his witnesses he is giving the nations warning of the crisis of Armageddon, near at hand, and, by the same means, is giving the people of good-will toward God and righteousness the opportunity of salvation, and the blessings of life in happiness and peace in that kingdom, soon to have full sway on earth; that people of good-will proving their faithfulness to God will have the privilege of carrying out the divine mandate to fill the earth with a righteous race of people to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We deplore the actions of the Nigerian government in banning the Society’s publications by which the gospel of the Kingdom is proclaimed (Matt. 24:14) and their burning to ashes thousands of said publications. We protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Aware that these repressive actions are in the main the result of Roman Catholic influence and pressure, and that the Papacy is used on the earth by the god of this world (2 Cor. 4:4) for the suppression of the truth of the Holy Scriptures and is seeking to get all men into its bonds of darkness, we declare that we shall not cease to witness against it, by the means which God has provided, that men may know of this scheme of the Devil to blind them to the good news of The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We aver that Jehovah’s witnesses are loyal subjects in every land; that the witness they give is neither ‘subversive’ nor ‘undesirable’ as its enemies declare; but the message they proclaim is one of hope for all men of good-will who love Almighty God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial and Baptism</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Memorial, which fell this year on Monday, April 19, was celebrated with great joy by all the consecrated both here in Nigeria and on the Gold Coast. The total attendance at the celebration is 2,370, and the number of partakers of the emblems is 86. The Lord is fulfilling his promise to bring into his fold his “other sheep”. (John 10: 16) According to reports yet to hand, a total of 1,521 persons have symbolized their consecration to God by water immersion this year, against a total of 800 for last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organization Instructions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Putting the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> into effect immediately we received it, we see that the Lord’s blessings have been poured out on the publishers. There is peace among the brethren throughout the country. The complaints that usually come to the office of one thing or the other are not now received frequently. Each one knows his duties, and the appointed servants are doing their best to serve according to the instructions pertaining to their particular duties. The news now being sent to the office from many of the companies is that of co-operation and unity among the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Owing to present conditions, the Branch office has been saddled with more work in attending to all enquiries by correspondence, typewriting out the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> texts to the various companies, and attending generally to the Kingdom interests. Several Insertions advertising The Theocracy have been made in the local papers, and handbills have been printed in English and Yoruba to the number of 79,000 on various Theocratic subjects from the Lord’s table by which the “other sheep” and those of good-will toward God and righteousness are being fed. This is really the Lord’s doing, in defiance of the enemy who thought to have closed in upon us. (Ps. 23:5) The world governments are doing all they can to stabilize themselves, but the shaking of both Satan’s heaven and earth continues. An evidence of this is seen in this: that some of our publications, numbering tens of thousands, were burnt to ashes by the authorities here, after storing them intact for more than 18 months. In reality, the banning and subsequent burning of this literature have neither eased the present situation nor stopped the shakiness as far as this part of the world is concerned. Jehovah’s irresistible army marches on to victory.—Joel 2: 1-11; Rev. 19:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to irregular mail service and examination of letters by the postal authorities, many reports from the brethren do not reach us in time, sometimes not at all, as is the case of the brethren at Freetown and throughout Sierra Leone. Brethren on the west coast of Africa continue to suffer for being obedient to God in carrying the life-sustaining waters of truth to those who ask for them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>SIERRA LEONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A consecrated American brother who traveled through Sierra Leone in the course of his business and later returned to the United States brought considerable information concerning the progress of the work. While the brethren have not been receiving the spiritual food at regular intervals, they have been provided for by the Lord and sent the message through the brother mentioned above that “by the Lord’s grace we are determined to carry on”. Regular service meetings and studies are being carried on and, although no figures are available, there is considerable field-service activity. The testimony for The Theocracy has not been blotted out by the demons and their religious agents in Sierra Leone, but the brethren continue to hold high the standard of “freedom in the new world”. Local printing of leaflets provides for distribution of the message in printed form to a limited degree throughout the territory, and this is supplemented by the continual and unfailing witness by word of mouth. The Lord is blessing the determination of the faithful in Sierra Leone.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Through the study of the Lord’s Word we see that we “are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses”, men of faith who proved worthy of the great blessings they will receive because they endured the tests placed upon them and maintained their integrity. Reading of the accounts concerning such men of integrity brings comfort to our hearts. To know that men who lived before us endured experiences and overcame hardships similar to those daily confronting us gives us strength to carry on in the work that we, Jehovah’s witnesses, have undertaken. Now, since the Lord has come to his temple and has brought together those who love him into one organization, there is another “cloud of witnesses”, easily to be seen by all, who are engaging in the Lord’s service. The assembly of this present-day “cloud of witnesses” by Jehovah’s enthroned King makes glad our hearts, because as members thereof we have the great privilege of serving the only true God and standing in integrity. And seeing the Lord’s continually adding zealous companions to associate with his witnesses is a further source of great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year’s report shows the faithfulness of God’s servants, their steadfastness, their absolute devotion to the cause of truth and righteousness. It is through faith and good works of Jehovah’s name-people today that many victories have been won. These victories were not gained easily, but through years of patience, suffering and hard work. We remember, too, that these victories were not achieved in the strength of the servants themselves, but only in the strength of the Lord and because Jehovah’s witnesses unitedly followed the lead of the Greater Jephthah, Christ Jesus, the Faithful and True Witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle, in Hebrews the twelfth chapter, says that it is “with patience” we run the course marked out for us, “looking away to the leader and Perfecter of the faith, Jesus, who for the joy set before him, endured the Cross, disregarding the Shame, and has sat down at the Right hand of the throne of God.” (Heb. 12: 2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font5"> It is as though Paul were talking to us today when he said we should “consider him attentively who has endured Such Opposition from sinners, so that you may not be wearied, being discouraged in your souls.” (Verse 3) What a wonderful Leader we have! and what a pleasure and joy it is to consider him, his works, his activity in going from house to house and village to village, standing up under persecution and under the taunts of the enemy. This opposition came upon him from sinners. We read and observe all these things, ‘so that we may not be weary or discouraged in our souls’ as we continue on in the work committed into our care. Jehovah’s witnesses in the past year have not become weary, but have been strengthened in their well-doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not endeavoring to make a name for themselves. If they were, then they would be easily entangled in the “sin which doth so easily beset” those who are looking for self-praise and aggrandizement. Jehovah’s witnesses flee from religion and the plaudits of men religion receives. The example given Jehovah’s witnesses by the apostle Paul is very interesting. Ue had every reason to put confidence in the flesh; however, he chose not to follow the traditions of his fathers, but to follow Christ Jesus, who set out the proper course in which to travel. In his epistle to the Philippians Paul said: “If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more.” (Phil. 3:4) Paul had more reasons to glory in the flesh than most people, having been circumcised the eighth day, having been of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew, and, as to the law, a Pharisee. And, speaking of zeal, he showed it in the persecution of the church. As to following out the law, he might be considered blameless. All of these things, which gave him excellent standing in the Jews’ religion, Paul counted as loss for Christ. They had no value or gain to him; and neither does position in the world or influence with worldly organizations hold any gain to Jehovah’s witnesses. They fully realize that they are in the world, but not a part of it. Any gain that one may have by reason of heredity or environment in this old world is counted as loss for the Kingdom’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle in his writings to the Corinthians stated plainly that he was free from all men. None of his natural ties bound him to the old world. But he did say, “For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.” (1 Cor. 9:19) So it is with Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide, no matter where they reside. They are free men. While they have been made free through Christ Jesus, they have made themselves servants unto all, that they might gain the more for the Kingdom. Though they be in concentration camps, they will be servants unto their fellow prisoners. Though they be in lands of which they are not native, they will learn the language, that they may serve the people there. Regardless of the condition in which the people of good-will are found—humble, poor, rich, uneducated or weak— Jehovah’s witnesses are glad to serve and do everything they can to aid these people. As Paul said, “To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.” (1 Cor. 9:22) Why do Jehovah’s witnesses take on these hardships ? Why do they go into the big cities, apartment houses, stores; visit the businessmen, the poor; witness to those who cannot read or write, and, in many instances, take the opportunity to teach people to read? Why do they go to all this trouble ? Why do they tax their patience to the limit? For the same reason that Paul made himself “all things to all men”; just for one reason, that is, “And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.”—1 Cor. 9: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So today we see Jehovah’s witnesses in all parts of the earth putting forth every effort to serve men for the “gospel’s sake”, aiding them in gaining a knowledge of the truth, which will bring life in the New World. They do this work of preaching the gospel “in all the world for a witness” for no other reason. This is hard to believe on the part of those who serve the Devil’s organization for selfish gain, but to those who are devoted to the Kingdom it is easily understood. They rejoice to bear the sufferings, the trials and difficulties that come upon them; and they do this gladly. Jehovah’s witnesses are not worried about just when the final battle will be fought and the old world of the Devil destroyed. They are interested in the one thing, namely, “that I might by all means save some.” Therefore the great work of free education for all men of good-will progresses and moves forward, and the results world-wide are gratifying and bring joy to everyone who is putting his heart, mind, soul and strength into this great work of witnessing in the interest of the Kingdom,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not trying to build up an organization and gain a great membership. Whatever the increase may be, it is given by the Lord for his own glory. Jehovah’s servants have one responsibility, and that is to preach this gospel of the Kingdom “in all the world for a witness”. The admonition, then, is given through the Lord’s Word to those who have an ear to hear, 'Flee unto the Kingdom and there seek refuge and protection from the impending disaster soon to follow.’ It will be necessary for those who seek refuge in the Lord’s organization to take part in the work of that organization and to aid others to come out from the Devil’s organization in these last days, so that they too may gain life in the New World. The Scriptures indicate that a great host is yet to come out from the peoples of all nations, kindreds and tongues, even as the prophet Isaiah, in the 60th chapter and 8th verse, stated: “Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?” This prophecy denotes that there will be a great ingathering of active witnesses for the Kingdom who will, for a short time before Armageddon, but sufficiently long to prove their integrity, come into the Lord’s organization and work there in the interests of the Kingdom; and a witness will be given far and wide, by the Lord’s grace, such as never has been given heretofore. The campaign of free education, which the Lord’s people by Jehovah’s grace are carrying on, will reach unto the ends of the earth. The work that is to be done will not be carried on without opposition; but, in the postwar era, we may expect great persecution and many difficulties in the furtherance of the Kingdom activity. This will not dampen the zeal or slacken the efforts on the part of Jehovah’s servants. Having the command from the Most High that this work </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font5"> be done and accomplished before Armageddon, they will go forward and do it, even as Christ Jesus and the apostles did it in their day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God, by His power, has kept the door of service open during this second World War. In many nations great effort was put forth on the part of the rulers and religionists to close down the work, but Jehovah’s witnesses did not stop. They continued to serve, and, even in this year 1943, the report shows that Jehovah’s witnesses have accomplished more in the way of giving a witness for the King and the Kingdom than at any time heretofore. This can be seen by reading the report published in the forepart of this book; but the summary of this report, too, is very encouraging. It shows the zeal of the entire organization; and, by the Lord’s grace and under His direction, it will continue to grow so that more persons will have the opportunity in this dark world to see the light. God says, “Ye are the light of the world,” and He admonishes us to let our light shine. It is the determination of the Society, by the Lord’s grace, to let the light of God’s Word shine in all the earth. Jehovah’s witnesses, wholly devoted to the Lord and consecrated to do his will, are behind and pushing hard this campaign of free education and enlightening of the people by the truth, which shall make them free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With reports received from fewer countries than in previous years, not because the work is stopped in these other countries, but because the mail service and communications have been practically cut off, we still find an increase in the number of servants engaging in Theocratic activity. The report for the service year of 1943 shows that there are now 109,794 publishers reporting field service each month, on the average, to compare with 106,000 publishers of the previous year. If reports had been received from all countries where we know Jehovah’s witnesses are working, this total number of publishers would be much higher. Of this number there are 8,407 engaging in the full-time service as pioneers. Some of them are going into countries where the witness has never been given before; some of them are planning to go to such countries as soon as opportunity affords. Those brethren attending the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, who are full-time pioneers, ordained ministers, are making such plans for future work. It is the sincere hope of the Society that many more persons will find their way clear to engage in this wonderful service of full-time pioneer work in their own land, and that by the end of 1944, if it is the Lord’s will, we shall have 10,000 such publishers scattered throughout all the world serving The Theocracy and carrying on real pioneer work among the people of good-will. One need not go far, or even leave home, to be a pioneer. The field is large; the workers, few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the service report for the year, all the publishers world-wide report the putting in of 28,726,524 hours of field service. This is indeed wonderful; for during these millions of hours praise was sung unto the Most High concerning his Kingdom and the marvelous acts that he has performed and is performing in the earth at the present time. What comfort and joy of heart must have been brought into many homes because of these hours of field service!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As long as the Lord’s people have literature to distribute and use in their home Bible-study work they will use it. During the service year 1943 it was possible in most cases to keep the brethren supplied with literature, particularly books, booklets and magazines, to carry on in the service activity. In the countries where literature was available the report shows that books and booklets were distributed to the amount of 26,724,049. This is more than a two-million increase over the previous service year. Since the Lord came to his tern-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">pie and revived the work, in 1918, there has been a marvelous growth in the Lord’s organization. Every effort has been put forth by Jehovah’s witnesses since that time to aid the remnant and their companions in understanding the truth, and helping others to understand. To this end, as the report shows, 425,190,814 copies of books and booklets have been distributed in the past twenty-three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only has a wonderful witness been given through the medium of books and booklets, but in the past year magazines were distributed in homes and in street witnessing to the number of 8,621,000 copies. This in itself is a marvelous witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is to be expected that as years go on, under the war regime, less distribution will be made, because of the shortage of paper and other supplies. However, the Lord’s people everywhere will take advantage of the placements of all books and will follow up, to see if these people are really interested, and, wherever they are, will aid them in home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each servant of the Lord should assume the responsibility now and henceforth of calling back on every person who obtains a bound book, at least, so that if this person shows unusual interest arrangements can be made to study that publication in his own home. It need not be the latest publication, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”.</span><span class="font5"> In some countries this publication is not available. In some places there are no books whatsoever, but tracts and pamphlets are used, or just the Bible. The main thing is to call back on those who are interested and comfort them. That is the commission placed upon all the servants of the Most High. This back-call work has been carried on to a marvelous extent during the past year. The report shows that there were 6,462,041 back-calls made, and many of these were eventually turned into regular book studies. It is hoped that during 1944, the next service year, millions more homes will be called upon in the back-call work and book-study activity so that a real educational work may be carried on to its fullest extent. It has been found that many people obtain books, read them casually and set them aside, and never get down to the real meat which these publications contain. By having a study in the home, and a teacher, these people of good-will learn more rapidly; and, due to the fact that the time is short, it is necessary now to devote as much time as possible to the work of free education that is being carried on far and wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The truth has made Jehovah’s witnesses free, and it is this same truth that will make free millions of other persons throughout the earth. Truth is sown for the righteous; water it and Jehovah will give the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the leadership of the Greater Jephthah, and at his command, Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions go forth in the field service with joy and gladness, looking to the years ahead for greater opportunities of magnifying the Lord’s name and Word. What a great privilege the servants of the Most High have! Into their hands have been committed the Kingdom interests. Seeing the people oppressed, downtrodden, and subjected to merciless rulers, it is necessary for the Lord’s people today to go forward and hold high the banner of the Kingdom, so that those who are looking for a better condition and who love righteousness may take a stand now and serve the Lord. We rejoice in the privileges we have of continuing in the service. We are thankful for the freedom we enjoy and we want to take this message of truth, that will make others free, to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Looking ahead to the marvelous time when the wicked shall be no more, Jehovah’s witnesses make the same exclamation today as did the psalmist in his time, when he was praising the Lord: “Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. Let every thing that hath breath praise the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord. Praise ye the Lord.” (Ps. 150:2, 6) Great is our joy and thanksgiving for the marvelous privilege we have of praising the Lord now, as servants with full knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes, and it is our delight and great honor to continue faithfully in this work of magnifying the Lord’s name and Word, knowing that in so doing we shall share eventually in the vindication of the same.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society (a Pennsylvania corporation) held October 1, 1943, a Resolution was offered and unanimously adopted, and request was made that the Resolution be published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> The Resolution follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Be it resolved by the members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society at the annual membership meeting for 1943:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the Theocratic Government of the New World is illimitable and knows no earthly boundary and has no earthly barriers. Its benefits are not withheld from any creature because of race, color or previous condition of servitude. Jehovah’s earthly organization, of which this Society is a part, has joyfully accepted the leadership of the Greater Jephthah, Christ Jesus, commissioned to declare the judgments of Jehovah throughout the earth. (Judg. 11:8,9; Matt. 24:14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “faithful and wise servant” has been and is anointed to hunt, search for and find all the Lord’s “other sheep” in all the earth that they may stand on the right hand of favor of Christ Jesus before Jehovah in His day of judgment. The religionists have been assigned to the left-hand side of condemnation. When the “other sheep” are located it is necessary to teach and educate each one of such people so that they may continue in good will toward Jehovah and be led in the way of life everlasting and receive salvation from Jehovah at Armageddon, the cataclysm now impending on the world. This obligation must be made “free” to all men in every land. Each person, regardless of station in life, in all nations must have an equal opportunity, with all other people and nations, to be educated in and acquire a knowledge and understanding of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To accomplish this magnificent world-wide undertaking of benevolence requires teachers and educators. In many lands there is a great shortage of teachers consecrated to God ; and the people suffer for a lack of spiritual food. With the undertaking so great and the time so short there is now presented upon the face of the earth a great international emergency which must be overcome by the Society. (Ezek. 3:18-20) This compels God’s people everywhere to meet the call for volunteers to join the forces or little army that the Society may be provided with servants so as to allow an equal distribution of teachers throughout the world. Thus the call of countries where there is a shortage can be answered and met. Jehovah has declared in his Word that there shall be no end to the increase of his government and peace. Furthermore, he declares that there is an innumerable multitude of people of all kindreds, nations and tongues to be brought under the Theocracy and New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each person must gird himself to meet his part of this tremendous undertaking now. It is gratifying to notice “the Society” has taken the lead in making preparations to meet the obligation placed upon it to do the job ahead and in the years to come. During the past year it has made provision to meet the need of the people of good-will as evidenced, among other things, through the opening and operation of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead In New York state and the arrangements to send specially trained teachers into</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">other countries, also the provision for the Course in Theocratic Ministry made available to every lover of righteousness. The many additional blessings of the past year of continued prosperity of the Lord’s organizations we summarize: The spiritual food provided; the recent and largest worldwide assembly in the history of the organization, which was held in spite of the restrictions and regimentation laws of the Devil’s world torn by war; the new publications; the increased light of revealed prophecy for our guidance; and the defeat by Jehovah in the courts of the enemy who have framed mischief by law. (Ps. 94:20) For this loving provision we give thanks to Jehovah and we extend to our president our sincere appreciation for his untiring zeal and devotion to Jehovah in arranging for the new instruments to be placed in our hands so that they may be used to the Lord’s honor and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">All of the above enumerated evidence proves beyond all doubt that there Is no power, in heaven or in earth, that can stop the forward march of Jehovah’s organization or frustrate the execution of his purposes by his servants in all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We unhesitatingly appeal to all of the consecrated servants of Jehovah everywhere to avoid the subtle snares of the adversary by keeping on the full armor of God so that each may maintain his integrity. Let us show our appreciation for Jehovah’s goodness toward us by taking the cup of salvation and paying our vows unto the Most High, not by standing still satisfied with old standards of service, but by increasing our service in preaching and teaching and attaining the quotas set by the Society. Thus we shall strengthen ourselves to run the race and continue in the long march with the Lord’s organization (not lagging behind) until the praise of Jehovah is upon the lips of every creature and the truth has covered the earth as the waters cover the deep and Christ, our King, has vindicated the holy name of our God, whose name alone is Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yeartext for 1944</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God.” —Ps. 143:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the true and sincere expression of everyone who loves God. From the very time that one comes to know God and His Son, Christ Jesus, he exclaims, “Teach me to do thy will.” This shows a humble spirit; and all men of goodwill show this spirit, because they desire instruction. Fully appreciating the need of counsel and more information concerning Jehovah’s gracious promises, they want to be told more of God’s Word. One whose heart is right toward God is teachable and accepts God’s Word as his guide, which is certain to lead any individual so accepting it in the right path if the individual follows the instructions set out in the Bible. One who is breaking away from this world no longer wants to be taught the theories and traditions of men, but, as expressed in the words of the yeartext, he wants to be taught the will of God. Even Christ Jesus, who was never contaminated with this world nor had any association with its politics, commerce and social functions, being separate from sinners because he was born perfect, at all times desired to do the will of his Father in heaven. Christ Jesus recognized his Father in heaven as the Great Teacher and his guide, and stated concerning himself: “I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.”—John 5: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus appreciated that he had the great privilege of sharing in the vindication of his Father’s name and therefore he must carry out his Father’s will in everything that he did. At all times he looked to his Father for instruction, and this instruction he found in the Lord’s Word, because prophecies were set forth therein that needed to be fulfilled by the Son of God, and they were. Again, in John 6: 38, he said: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was a wise man, and it is well for everyone who has chosen the course that Jesus laid out for us to follow to be wise as he was in obeying the will of our Father in heaven. “Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.”—Prov. 9: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s command today to his people is to carry on a great work of free education among men of good-will. Therefore the words of the text for this year, “Teach me to do thy will,” would apply to every hearer of the Word of God; and an obligation rests upon every servant who is worshiping God in spirit and in truth to do the will of his Father and hearken unto His commands. If we are following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, and we are, then we will do a work similar to that done by him. Jesus was a great teacher. When upon the earth, the Scriptures inform us, he taught in the synagogues and he taught in the villages. The people sought him out, came unto him, and were taught. Jesus sat daily in the temple' teaching, and he went about from village to village teaching the people the message and doctrine that he received from his Father in heaven. He sent his disciples out in twos from village to village to teach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus, after his resurrection, gave a final command to his disciples when he stated, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.” (Matt. 28:19) This great teaching program or instruction of the people of good-will has always been essential and necessary, and all related to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word. Today Jehovah’s witnesses have the great privilege of informing others concerning God’s purposes, so that they may take a stand for the Kingdom and worship and praise their Father in heaven, and be taught of Him to do His will. The reason that they want to be taught, and want to do His will, is that Jehovah is their God. Jehovah teaches them through his organization under Christ Jesus. Anxious to be taught, delighting to teach others, and putting full trust in Jehovah, they speak words today even as David spoke in his time: “Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness . . . for I am thy servant.”—Ps. 143:10,12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truths may enter in.—Isa. 26:2, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s remnant keep the truth, not by remaining silent about it, for that would mean denying the truth by letting the error stand unchallenged. They keep the truth both by being faithful to it and by telling it out to others. “A faithful witness will not lie.” (Prov. 14: 5) The continual giving forth of the truth fixes it more deeply and inerasably in the heart and mind of the truthteller. God has favored no other people on earth with the truth than the remnant of his Theocratic organization. (Ps. 147:19, 20) No one that loves the lies of religion can be of the righteous nation and enter into Zion. No lover of religious lies can be associated with that nation; and those “strangers” of good-will who now become the companions of the remnant must likewise love the truth and must keep it by faithfully witnessing to it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen.—Ps. 33:12, Am. Rev. Ver. </span><span class="font5">“Christendom” reasons that above the coming global government must be religion as the spiritual guide, so as to gain the blessings of “the god of this world”. Then it will not be enough for any man to say, “I am a citizen of this nation, or a citizen of that nation.” No; but the responsibility resting upon each individual to support the common world organization will oblige every man and woman to say, “I am a citizen of the world.” There is one nation that will refuse to join in that world federation or league of nations. The citizens of that nation will refuse to become a part of the world and to acknowledge themselves as citizens of this world. That one exception is the “nation whose God is Jehovah”. The King of that nation of Jehovah is Christ Jesus. In prayer to Jehovah concerning the citizens of His nation Jesus said: “They are not of the world, even as I am not.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I am withered like grass. But thou, 0 Lord, shalt endure for ever.—Ps. 102:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the prime target of attack by all foes, demon and human. He will survive the final crisis that is now upon the doomed old world. This world will not survive the zenith of the crisis at the universal war of Armageddon; but Jehovah’s Word, the Bible, which fanatical religionists incited by papal Rome have repeatedly consigned to the flames, will survive and be completely fulfilled. “The word of the Lord endureth for ever.” (1 Pet. 1:25) Whosoever now trusts in that Word and obeys its expression of its Author’s will finds strength to endure in the mounting world crisis. He enjoys a certain hope of life without end in the new world of righteousness. The old world and its backers must pass away; “but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” (1 John 2:17) It is the highest wisdom to serve Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A. new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.—John 13:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Love” meaning “unselfish devotion”, we can appreciate that it means far more than personal affection for another or a sentimental appreciation of what is beautiful and kind. Love reveals itself in a perfect expression of unselfishness. Love reveals itself in an action. By love Christ’s followers must serve one another, not for any personal gain or profit, because all together are devoted servants of the Lord God. It must be because of unselfish devotion to God and the interest each one has in the other to aid, comfort and help his brother in the faith, that all men should know and discern that these are the disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. The aid and service to be rendered are not merely in material things, but in the things that assist God’s consecrated people to continue faithful in His service and to gain eternal life.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life.—Ps. 36:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah will make life worth living in the new world. That means it will be a world of righteousness. “For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth righteousness: the upright shall behold his face.” (Ps. 11: 7, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font5">He will determine who will live in the righteous new world. To such only will he give life abundant without end. It is his will and purpose that both heaven and earth be inhabited forever by intelligent creatures living in perfect harmony with Him and under his complete protection, without molestation by any doers of iniquity. Jehovah is the never-exhausted Source of life, and all living creation is absolutely dependent upon him. He has purposed the new world of life and light and has appointed the time for its beginning. That time is at hand. He has provided a way to life in that blessed world. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us.—1 Pet. 3:20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To escape the great deluge of destruction at the battle of Armageddon it is now necessary to be baptized unto the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus. Through the remnant of his body members yet on earth this greater “Preacher of Righteousness” has called attention to the signs or evidences of the “end of the world”. He has served warning on the rulers and the people of the fast-approaching “day of vengeance of our God”. To the Greater Noah the people of good-will must flee. They must place themselves under his leadership and protection, and must comply with the instructions which he sends through the Theocratic organization, the antitypical Ark. Make all speed, urges the Greater Noah to those who see the signs of the end.—Matt. 24:20,21. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It is high time to awake out of sleep.—Rom. 13:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The days of “this present evil world” are numbered. The days of the New World, which Jehovah brings in with righteousness, will be numberless; it will be a world without end. To enjoy it one will have to live for ever. Existence in this world is uncertain and quickly passing. All the selfish things in which one can indulge during this present existence are not to be compared with the clean, satisfying and eternal things of the new world which is at hand. It is high time to begin living for the New World. Unspeakably favored will be all those who gain “in the world to come eternal life”. (Mark 10: 29, 30) Members of this generation who long to gain this glorious prize must break off with this old world before its disastrous end. They must begin living now in unwavering expectancy of the New World. Rejoice in hope of the early realization of the New World. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And above all things have fervent charity [love] among yourselves: for charity [love] shall cover the multitude of sins.—1 Pet. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such fervent love toward one another springs from their love of this thing in common, Jehovah’s New World of righteousness. This is the binding tie between the remnant of Christ’s anointed followers and also their companions, his “other sheep”. It is love due, not to religion, but to truth. Christians love one another because they all together love Bible truth and purify their lives of all religion by such truth. (1 Pet. 1: 22, 23) Christian love is based on principle and hence is not passion or sentimentalism. It does not cover any sins of unfaithfulness or rebellion against the Lord God. Christians prefer to suffer anything rather than to commit such sins in themselves, and could not condone or forgive such sins in others. They therefore help one another to avoid such unpardonable sins against the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Let all things be done unto edifying. Let all things be done decently and in order.—1 Cor. 14:26, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the God of order. Without confusion he made the shining bodies which bedeck the heavens and placed them in their positions. The stars and planets move in trackless space according to the path the Creator ordained for them, and thus order pervades throughout the universe visible to man. Everything, in relation to everything else, shows forth wise organization that the divine will may be fulfilled, at the times appointed by Jehovah God. Observing this fact as true of the inanimate material creation, all who desire to do the Creator’s will appreciate the need and fitness of organization. They see the need of determining their proper place in His approved organization, and that they must move about their work within the organization that the final result may be to the Creator’s glory and praise.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.—Jas. 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">House-to-house visiting upon the people irrespective of creed is a refusal by Jehovah’s witnesses to recognize the hate-provoking barriers of religious sectarianism and sectionalism, which divisive barriers are anti-Christian because “Christ is not divided”. It is also a practical recognition by Jehovah’s witnesses of each one’s “freedom of worship” and of his full right to “freedom from fear” in exercising the liberty to hear and choose what he wants as respects God and Christ’s kingdom. Door-to-door visitation and placing literature with the people and accepting grateful contributions from receivers does not transform them from evangelists into book agents. Distribution of Bible literature is preaching the Kingdom gospel by the printed page in addition to preaching by mouth, and hence is not taxable.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing.—Eccl. 12:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In human or worldly processes of law the nation’s supreme court is the tribunal of last appeal in most cases; it is the court of last resort. Decisions of such court may appear to have infallibility and to be beyond recall, yet such human supreme court is not infallible. It makes mistakes, and at times reverses itself. Heaven’s Supreme Court is infallible; its decisions are unchangeable. Rightly, it is the court of first appeal. To go aright and to be guided in the way of divine approval and of life in peace and prosperity all creatures should appeal first to Its decisions and abide by them. Jehovah is the Supreme Court in Himself. He created and took into association with himself another judge, but not of equal power and authority with Himself. That Associate Judge is a just and perfect one, God’s only begotten Son. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler?—Matt. 24:3,45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who see the signs and wisely heed their portent will zealously serve the King and the Kingdom. Those who blind themselves to the signs and defy their meaning will show indifference to the Kingdom interests and drunkenly indulge themselves in the things of this world and hypocritically oppose the Kingdom and its servants. Among the signs speaking most loudly of the world’s end and the invisible presence of Christ in the Kingdom is the visible sign of two opposing servants, a “faithful and wise servant” and “that evil servant”. Their existence and activities must appear when Satan’s world rule ends and Jehovah’s kingdom begins. Those servants are visible today. This is evidence that Satan’s rule has been interrupted and the Kingdom has begun. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.—Rom. 10:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regardless of how grandly the visible things of heaven and earth testify that God is, they cannot reveal to man the certain and unchangeable purpose of God. A declaration of the purpose of Jehovah God is absolutely required for a true knowledge of him and, consequently, for true faith in God. The announced and delivered word of God is necessary to real faith. Knowledge of Jehovah, the God of purpose, is a necessary part of the true faith. Without knowledge of him and his purpose there is no actual faith, because without it belief or credence is lacking its most necessary thing. The truthful testimony concerning Jehovah is imparted by his declared and written Word, so that faith is impossible without the Word of God’s revelation. Today, therefore, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">faith</span><span class="font5"> means the knowledge and acceptance of God’s written Word as true, and a heartfelt reliance upon it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The inseparable connection between heaven and earth for the sake of permanent righteousness, peace and happiness to humankind is clearly revealed in Peter’s words of hope to Christians. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Heavens</span><span class="font5"> does not mean what is visible in space over our heads; it means intelligent higher powers, more powerful than men and invisible to them because of their superiority. The destruction of Satan’s wicked heavens of demons and also of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">earth</span><span class="font5"> he engineers is at hand by the act of the Almighty God of righteousness. That will be the victory crowning “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. Thereafter the promise of a new earth beneath righteous new heavens will be fulfilled to “men of good-will”. The peace of that post-Armageddon “new world” will never have an end. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fear of the Lord tendeth to life.—Prov. 19:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan’s strikeaway from Jehovah and for independence of action uncontrolled by God did not win a new and larger freedom for that rebellious one. His desire to be responsible to no one but himself, and his effort to exist apart from the Creator’s universal organization and its regulations was not the way of selfliberation. He was merely overcome by his own passion to have world domination and be worshiped and served like Jehovah. The only effect was to make him the victim and slave of his own selfishness, sin. It made him the child of death, utter destruction. The way of righteousness and keeping one’s obligations to Jehovah may appear to be a narrow way, but the one who loosely abandons himself to the motions and pleasures of sin finds at last only the narrowness of the pit and grave. Despite the broadness of the way thither, it is not a free way and its end is the loss of all movement and activity. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At Christ’s coming in his kingdom he is attended by all his holy angels, and these he uses to carry out Jehovah’s command as gatekeepers. The “gates” were flung open after his coming to the temple in 1918. Isaiah’s prophecy represents the remnant as approached to the city and outside her walls, when the call from heaven goes forth: “Open ye the gates, and let the just nation, that keepeth the truth, enter in.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(JDouay)</span><span class="font5"> The remnant are in line to be of that “holy nation”, The Theocratic Government, which is a righteous nation and a just. They seek first God’s kingdom and his righteousness, and the greatest work of righteousness is the vindication of His name. The delivered remnant rejoice in His salvation and say: “Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord.”—Ps. 118:19.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait.—Ps. 25:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everlasting life is a free gift from Jehovah God. Hence the education he imparts unto life everlasting is likewise free. He does not make teaching a profession for his personal maintenance or for selfish gain, but as an expression of his loving-kindness toward those who seek and appreciate eternal life in a free world. He is not dependent upon any or even all creatures for enrichment of himself. Nothing his learners or disciples might render to their great Teacher could add to his wealth, for all things come of him and only of His own can creatures give unto him. He gives teaching unselfishly, solely for the benefit that his creatures get therefrom. His great delight is in having them receive the instruction and wisely use it and thereby be kept from that which would work against their eternal life.

<p><span class="font5">The speakers must be those who have proved'that Jehovah is the only true and eternal God. They must be those who have made or chosen him to be their God, and who exalt him by publicly showing forth his praises and virtues. They confess and praise his name by declaring it throughout all the earth before he shows his invincible power over the enemy by destroying that one’s diabolical organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In fine, </span><span class="font5">they must be Jehovah’s witnesses. Isaiah, who first spoke the prophecy, was himself one of Jehovah’s witnesses; and his name means “salvation of Jehovah”. His prophecy had its first and partial fulfillment in 536 B.C., and it was Jehovah’s faithful remnant of witnesses who in effect voiced the words of Isaiah 25:1. They foreshadowed a like faithful remnant of spiritual Israelites, Jehovah’s witnesses today. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I will open my mouth in a parable.—Ps. 78:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah inspired many parables, both to illustrate his purpose and to conceal it till the due time. A parable is a likeness or comparison, a similitude or simile. In a parable things or doings in the natural life of men are used to picture other things or doings that correspond, but which are on a larger scale, of greater importance and of spiritual value and meaning. Ezekiel, whom Jehovah addressed as “Son of man”, he inspired to speak parables to the nation of Israel. Such parables were also prophecies, which find their fulfillment in happenings of our day that have a connection with the spiritual things of God. Ezekiel and the psalmist were themselves prophetic figures of a greater parable-teller to come, namely, Christ Jesus, who was called “The Son of man”. At the proper time according to the purpose of God Jesus addressed the common people in parables. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The great Fountain of life has set up righteous standards and requirements for all who would forever drink of the water of life in the new world. He does not require of his creatures the impossible for them. In his standards and requirements, however, God does not compromise with iniquity or wickedness. Hence, to meet what God calls for in those whom he approves for life and blessings, one must have first a love of righteousness or that which is right. In trying to measure up to God’s standards you may expect, and his Word forewarns you, that the world and its backers will try to discourage you, and then to oppose you, and finally to punish and make you suffer for walking the way that Jehovah God marks out. They are not your true friends and benefactors in so doing, but are the dupes and tools of the demons under Satan. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those who love truth and righteousness will not be dismayed because a choice of Jehovah God and his new world will require such a radical change of living and of viewpoint from that of the people of the world. Those who are seriously bent on taking the unerring path that leads to life under God’s kingdom can not afford to be caring about what men of this world will think about them and do to them. Popularity and friendship with the world has never yet brought life and never can bring it; rather, worldly good-standing means disapproval and enmity with God, the Fountain of everlasting life. (Jas. 4:4) Why? Because the old world is not of God nor for Him, and there is enmity between the old world and the new world. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Elders, . . . feed the flock.—1 Pet. 5:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the “other sheep” class have been years in the way since Christ’s coming to the temple in 1918. They have become mature, well trained in the teaching of the Lord God. They have maintained their integrity till now, all the while suffering the persecution the Devil brings against them. They have proved themselves to be trustworthy brethren. Because of such and their many years of faithful service they are properly classed as mature or ripened ones. In many places where there are few or no members of the anointed remnant they have been appointed to serve because of their maturity or eldership, and they have accepted such responsibilities as elder brethren. Therefore the admonition at 1 Peter 5:1,2 applies also to such ones. These, as elders, must also fill the service appointments in the congregations and must diligently attend to this stewardship committed into their consecrated hands. —Ezra 8:17, 20.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hated of all men for my name's sake; but he that en-dureth to the end shall be saved.—Matt. 10:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hatred “for my name’s sake” means hatred for what the name actually represents. Because Jesus faithfully endured in his integrity toward God even to the shameful death, “God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.” Before ever Jehovah exalted him to a glorious heavenly station second only to His own, God’s Son already had the name “Jesus” and “Christ”. Hence the “name” that God gave him at the time of his exaltation must refer to his lofty office as Jehovah’s Vindicator and the King of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, which Government is the capital or chief organization of His universal organization. Hence the Son’s official name is above every other name save that of Jehovah himself, because Jehovah is Supreme. As it is written: “The head of Christ is God.”—1 Cor. 11:3. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.—Luke 22:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus still had his flesh intact, with nothing detracted from it. His breaking the bread and saying, “This is my body,” proves he was not referring to his own humanity, and also that the substance of the bread was not changed, but was merely being used as a symbol of something larger than his mortal flesh. Consequently his words “my body” must mean the great spiritual body of which Christ Jesus is the Head, namely, “the body of Christ.” Those to be associated with him in the kingdom of heaven make up that body, and God’s Word limits the final number of “body” members to 144,000 under Christ Jesus, the capital member. To these Jesus said: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” Thus this privilege of being “body” members was “given for you”, his followers.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah long ago foretold the epoch or day when all wrongs shall be righted. He appointed the day and provided for its operation. Its processes of justice will not depend upon any human creature or court, but upon the just and mighty One whom Jehovah God has designated and whom He backs with almighty power. Of all wrongs committed the greatest and most flagrant has been that done to God’s holy name. The Judge of God’s appointment will rectify that long-standing wrong and vindicate the name of Jehovah God. As far back as Eden Jehovah announced a day of universal reckoning and foretold the One to whom he would give “authority to execute judgment”. That day has come. The Judge is on the bench at God’s temple. The end of all who cause unjust suffering is at hand. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jesus must appear in God’s presence for his disciples and present his sacrificial merit and provide for their being taken into the Theocratic Government with him. At the right hand of Jehovah God his Father he waited until God’s due time that his enemies be made his footstool, at the end of the world. Then he would return, the place in The Theocratic Government having been prepared, the Kingdom having begun in 1914. He having returned, the message, namely, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand,” must again be published and the faithful remnant of followers must do the publishing. The apostles and other faithful followers asleep in death he raised to life in the spirit in heaven and thus received them to himself. The faithful remnant yet on earth he gathers to himself at the temple, into a condition of unity. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the light of those prophecies which focuses on the time concerning which Jesus prophesied, it is clearly discernible that his prophecy of a “faithful and wise servant” (Matt. 24:45-47) was not foretelling some individual man. He was foretelling a class, a people, namely, the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses. After only a remnant of natural Jews denied themselves and took up the stake of reproach to come after Christ Jesus as their Leader and King, Jehovah turned to the non-Jewish nations. Since then he has been taking out from the worldly nations a “people for his name”, spiritual Israelites, upon whom the name of Jehovah is called. These, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">as a people,</span><span class="font5"> make up God’s servant, and Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Chief Servant among them and is their Head.

<p><span class="font5">Those counted worthy to gain the New World by devoting themselves to God’s righteousness and who continue faithful will live in the New World and never see death. The King of the New World declared he had nothing in common with the “prince of this world” and therefore his kingdom could not be of this world. The establishment of the New World, therefore, means a fight, both in heaven and in earth. The world of darkness and wickedness and its prince must go; the world of light and righteousness and its Theocratic Government of Jehovah by his Son must come in, to abide forever. Under such righteous government the worship of Jehovah will alone obtain throughout the universe. It will be freely practiced on the earth without interference and opposition. All religious persecutors will have been destroyed. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, a white horse; and he that sat on him had a how; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.—Rev. 6:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The horse which the crowned and reigning Christ Jesus rides symbolizes just and righteous warfare against the foes of Jehovah and of his anointed King, who leaves the throne to mount the battle horse. His bow pictures his power to shoot out destruction from afar against the enemies without requiring his bodily presence in the immediate neighborhood of the earth or other location of such enemies. Casting Satan and his demon organization out of heaven was the first conquest of the King at war. It was, and is not his last. At the battle of Armageddon he will complete his conquests for the vindication of his Father’s name. He will then execute Jehovah’s judgment to the full against Satan’s entire organization. He will “send forth judgment unto victory”. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of heaven is at hand.—Matt. 10:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After Jesus’ death, resurrection and ascension to heaven, the Kingdom was further preached, but the announcement that it was at hand was not made. The apostle Paul explains that the King was absent, having ascended to the right hand of God, and that he was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">expecting,</span><span class="font5"> or waiting, there until his enemies should be made his footstool. (Heb. 10:12,13) Once again the earth rings with the joyous announcement that “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. By whom is the announcement made? It must be and is made by those who bring forth the fruits of the Kingdom; that is, the remnant of the anointed witnesses of Jehovah. And these are now joined by a glad multitude of persons of good-will who hail the King and the Kingdom as vigorously and earnestly as the great multitudes hailed him 1900 years ago on his ride into Jerusalem. Why has the Kingdom announcement been revived? Because Satan’s world has ended and the King has come. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The word of Christ Jesus the Judge is therefore the word of God. It expresses the commandment of God for those who seek life abundant. His commandment is unto life everlasting, and obedience to his commandments results in the gift of endless life to the obedient one. It is in the time of judgment that God’s word and commandment are specially made known, clear and understandable, because it is according to such word and commandment that the creatures on trial are judged. This denotes a wide publication of God’s word and law in the “last day”, the day of judgment. “It shall come to pass in the last days, that . . . out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations.”—Isa. 2: 2-4. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Feed the flock of God . . . taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly.—1 Pet. 5:2. </span><span class="font5">There was no constraint exercised upon the apostles to take such oversight and tending of God’s flock, but they accepted the responsible special service willingly. The house-to-house work in search for the lost sheep which those apostles all did is not to be forced upon anyone by constraint. It must be undertaken willingly by those desirous of serving God in the right way. Likewise, if anyone today does not want the privilege of serving in an elder’s position of company servant or other servant in a congregation, he should not be constrained. Evidently he does not have proper understanding of the Lord’s Word and is not in proper condition to feed God’s flock. Hence the privilege of service should be withheld or withdrawn from such unwilling one. None should shirk responsibility and try to shift it onto another.

By God’s grace, which was sufficient for them, you too can overcome this world and its death-dealing course and win the prize of life in perfect conditions. His grace does not fail his servants in this “modern” age of “science falsely so called”. It merely requires faith to trust him for his grace, if you choose to walk in his paths and to endure the disapproval and opposition of this world. No one endured more from the world than Christ Jesus, and he said: “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33) Believing and following him, you are sure to overcome also.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is good and upright, because he is righteous. Mercifully he points out the right way to those who have erred. Those who realize they have taken the wrong way and who are afflicted in spirit because of it Jehovah invites to “taste and see that the Lord is good”. He assures them that the young lions depend on their own strength and might and yet do suffer hunger, but that “they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing”. (Ps. 34: 8,10) Such as seek him find that Jehovah’s goodness and mercy follow them all the days of their life, though they be in the midst of the enemies of truth and righteousness. (Ps. 23:6) Such goodness, experienced while yet wickedness prevails and causes so much suffering, is merely a foretaste of Jehovah’s boundless goodness which those who do good will forever enjoy in the New World. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Substance</span><span class="font5"> literally, means that which stands under or subsists, hence a basis or foundation, and that which thus becomes a ground for confidence. Viewing substance as a ground for confident assurance, the apostle used the expression at Hebrews 3:14. To believe in things we hope for there must be firm and irremovable grounds, a basis or foundation for confidence and reliance. Why so? Because what we hope for we do not yet see. (Rom. 8: 24, 25) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evidence</span><span class="font5"> here literally means conviction, that which convinces us, an evident manifestation or demonstration, and is thus a conviction against error, a refuting of it, a reproof or rebuke against untruth. God’s written Word supplies this conviction. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) To serve such purpose of conviction the writing of God’s Word must be the absolute truth.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God favors no negotiated peace with the enemy; neither will the peace of the postwar “new order” be of his making. Builders of that more united global arrangement will not have the “Prince of Peace” as one of their allies, and those planning ahead do not count on him. More than a global government is needed if a durable peace with unfluctuating prosperity is to be brought in and kept. Righteousness, with an unselfish devotion to it, is the only basis for lasting peace. A global administration could become the instrument of higher powers for the greatest oppression yet upon all humankind.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah only is free in the absolute sense. When he was alone, before he began his work of creation, he carried no weight of responsibility for any creatures. Of his own free will and good pleasure he began his creative work, and yet he is responsible to none of his creatures. None of such can rightfully make complaint to God for the station he occupies among the Creator’s works. All of his faithful sons are free. He created none of his children unto bondage. Their freedom, however, is relative; it does not exist apart from their Father, Jehovah. It lies in living and acting in harmony with the laws and conditions he has made to apply to them and which allow them the fullest expression to their lives with good to themselves and all about them and to the Creator’s glory. Jehovah God is the Supreme One, the great God of freedom, and the only one such. Freedom originates with Him.

Ancient Judah was the land of which Zion was the capital city, and where its king “sat on the throne of Jehovah” as His Theocratic representative. Judah now pictures the earthly condition of those in line for membership in the heavenly Zion, Jehovah’s capital organization.

<p><span class="font5">Prayer without ceasing does not signify shutting up themselves behind the walls of a monastery or nunnery and doing nothing but repeating prayers. That is religion. It is forbidden by the Lord, and does not allow for getting His work done. Ceaseless praying means, therefore, using always the avenue of prayer to God when it is fitting and necessary as one keeps on in His service. The great enemy and his hordes of demons and wicked men come in like a flood and seek to overwhelm Jehovah’s witnesses and their advertising of God’s kingdom. Then the Lord raises up his standard of fighting truths, Kingdom truths, against the opposers who defy being bound by God’s kingdom. Not to yield to the pressure nor to compromise with the foe, but to hold true to the God-given commission to preach the Kingdom gospel, this requires his witnesses to “pray without ceasing”.

Will they believe and be entrapped by glowing propaganda of the old-world prophets ? or will they believe and act upon the sure promises of God’s Word? “Let God be true, but every man a liar.” (Rom. 3:4) To believe God and his Word as true, man’s words to the contrary, is being realistic. The prophecies of his Word are realities today, as a comparison of them with world conditions and events proves beyond honest denial. The prophecies of God, who is true, will go on fulfilling until, shortly, the old world will have disappeared at Armageddon.

He took it seriously. Like Jesus, Jehovah’s present-day witnesses point to Isaiah 61:1-3 and 43:10-12 as their commission from God to preach the good news of the righteous New World. But religious animosity and prejudice cause officials everywhere to deny them freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom from fear, and freedom of worship of God according to a conscience instructed in His Word. The anti-Jehovah religionists are the “false prophets” which were foretold to arise at the end of the world, whereas any candid examination of the commission to preach, stated at Isaiah 61:1-3, shows that Jehovah’s house-to-house witnesses are the true preachers and ambassadors of the only new world of freedom.

Jehovah, the great Teacher, tells us in his Word about “men of good-will” today living who will learn of him and act according to knowledge. They will therefore pass alive through the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” and emerge into the cleansed earth of his new world. What education for any worldly calling or destiny could surpass the instruction and training for this blessed reward to “men of good-will” ? Such education Jehovah God now offers by Christ Jesus to “whosoever will”; and those who are espoused to Christ Jesus as members of his “bride” have a part in extending it to the meek ones of earth for their good and comfort.—Rev. 22:17.

He spreads the abundantly supplied table of good cheer that all “men of good-will” may celebrate the day. He is the God of plenty, and all those who turn to His worship shall know no want. The day of Jehovah is specially a day of freedom from want for His people. It is a time of feasting and celebration, for the grandest of all reasons, because it is on His day that he takes over the rule of the earth and reigns from his royal residence in Zion, his capital organization.

And this they do “to the glory of God the Father”. Every creature that attains to life in the New World, whether in heaven or on earth, will likewise have to recognize the high office Jehovah conferred on Christ Jesus at his resurrection. That office Jehovah put into active operation in 1914. Every creature living in the New World will have to acknowledge Jesus Christ as one of the “Higher Powers” with Jehovah. He must live in accord with that fact, fully bowing to all responsibilities and obligations owed to Jesus’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">name </span><span class="font5">or exalted office. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—John 6:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God fed his covenant people on miraculous bread, manna from heaven, and mixed with which there was no leaven. Hence eating manna from heaven pictured the doing of God’s will by his covenant people as Jesus did it. The doing of that will through Christ results in life. Jesus’ doing God’s will in the flesh set the example for his footstep followers. (John 4:32-34) By following Jesus’ course in the flesh as a doer of Jehovah’s will these gain immortality, or “life in themselves”, and abide in the “body of Christ” and are exalted to a seat with him in the throne of his kingdom in heaven. Hence partaking of the bread at the Lord’s supper pictured copying Jesus’ example as a servant and witness of Jehovah God and thereby proving oneself a member of “his body”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We have tongues to speak, or at least some means to pass out vital information, whether it be by word of mouth, sign-language, writing, printed page, or recorded speeches for phonographic reproduction. All these we should put to work expressing the “oracles of God”, which oracles are his Word, containing the declaration of his purpose by his King and kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses give out no man’s message. In many places they are deprived of the various modern means to pass on or distribute the Lord’s message or “oracles”; yet they have their tongues and these they faithfully use to declare his name and New World government. He has graciously put his Word in their hearts and mouths; he has also put his spirit, his moving and guiding power, upon them; and these gifts from the Lord will not depart from them as long as he judges them faithful.—Isa. 59: 21.

<p><span class="font5">Judas Iscariot is the prototype of that evil servant whom Jesus foretold. Judas had been entrusted with Kingdom interests, having been commissioned to preach the Kingdom message and to perform miracles. As one of the twelve apostles he held an intimate and confidential relationship to Jehovah’s Elect Servant. However, he was unfaithful to his trust, was greedy for money that was contributed to the Kingdom service, misused the confidential information he had of Christ Jesus, and sought gain from the enemy to the damage of the visible organization of Jehovah’s people. He hid his traitorous heart and purpose from the unsuspecting apostles down to the end. Brazenly he dared to kiss Jesus and greet him with a “Hail, Master!” while betraying him and bringing him into the courts of law, namely, the Supreme Court, or Sanhedrin, and Pilate’s and Herod’s court.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is within the reach of prayer by humans here on earth. He is not too lofty, nor too far removed, to be able to hear the expressions to him by puny creatures amid our sinful, imperfect conditions. Neither is he indifferent and unconcerned. Only the lawless he tunes out. (Ps. 34:16; Prov. 15: 8) By his powers, more wonderful and incomprehensible than radio, he is able to detect and pick up man’s unvoiced petition offered within the hidden retreats of the heart or mind. And his powers of response are just as marvelous, to His glory. (Eph. 3:20,21) The primary issue of God’s universal domination must be settled here at the earth. Because of this Jehovah could not be and is not indifferent toward prayers of worthy creatures on this small planet. He invites true prayer. He watches for it. Prayer to the great Life-giver is vital to all life-seekers. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The elders of the congregations whom Peter addressed are not elective elders or appointive elders, due to a congregational election or the appointment by any pope or religious dignitary. They are not religionists, but are Christians, and are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">elders</span><span class="font5"> by virtue of Christian growth, being mature, well versed in Jehovah’s Theocratic law, and fulfilling his commandments by the course of action they take. Such are the ones in the congregation who properly set the example for the associate members. Not only must Peter feed the Lord’s “sheep” and look well to their eternal interests, but also all those who are set in places of responsibility in the Theocratic organization. From among the elders the ones who are made servants in God’s organization are taken. God sets them in the church-body as it pleases him.

<p><span class="font5">“Bless” (eulogy) here means “to speak well of; to praise”. Because of the unusual Kingdom privileges which the new supper represented, Jesus spoke well of God and praised him and thanked him. He praised Jehovah his Father as the great Deliverer and Savior, whose act of deliverance and salvation had been memorialized by the passover feast just partaken of and whose purpose to set up His kingdom and vindicate His name thereby was symbolized in the supper Jesus was now introducing. He thanked Jehovah as the Author of the Kingdom, for his privilege of being King of it, and for the privilege of having a Kingdom “body”, namely, a group of associates to be united with him in the heavenly throne.

They do not permit political differences of the nations to divide them and to cause them to slay one another. Anyone devoted to God and called to his kingdom under Christ and who follows the Master’s commandment, “That ye love one another; as I have loved you,” will never fail to make his own calling and election sure, while aiding his brethren to make theirs so. In such unbreakable love he will maintain his integrity toward God. He will be true and steadfast to his heavenly Father and will follow out all the commandments of God, whose children he loves. He will at all times be wholly devoted to The Theocracy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

So they follow the Son’s course of obedience to God’s law, that through him they might gain eternal life. The above requirements for life must be met even under provocation from tailers, evildoers and persecutors. Certain knowledge helps the mistreated Christian to take the course looking to the eventual good of the misinstructed one. “Knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:9) Being called to gain divine blessings both now and in the New World, they seek to be a blessing to others.

Not by virtue of any constitution drawn up by creatures to organize a national or world government is Jehovah the Most High Judge, nor is He limited or held in check by what is written down in any state-making document on earth. He is the First and Most High Judge in his own right, by his own power and wisdom, and according to his own ever-existent being and his creatorhood. He is the source of the supreme law, which law is perfect and hence righteous. (Ps. 19:7) He is the Creator of the written Constitution which governs his visible organization on earth. “From his right hand went a fiery law for them.” (Deut. 33: 2, 3) Jehovah needs no associate judge or justices with whom to consult or to qualify or overrule his own rulings, judgments and decisions.—Isa. 40:13,14. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7JI</span></p>

What religion builds up in men is, not faith, but credulity. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Credulity</span><span class="font5"> means belief or readiness to believe traditions on slight or uncertain evidence, and hence being easily imposed upon by the priests and teachers of religion. In effect, religion is unbelief toward the Word of God; it is a lack of faith. Religionists hear the Word of God without being thereafter doers of that Word by proper works. (Jas. 1:22) To the person of true faith God’s Word, the Bible, is “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen”.

Peace and righteousness among men that live on earth will not come until they unite in the sincere worship of Jehovah God according to the knowledge and understanding of the truth. His undefeatable will is that all creatures crowned with life in heaven and in earth shall be gathered together in one as to their worship of Him, because he is the Supreme One, the Almighty God.

<p><span class="font5">To show the rightness and Godlikeness of receiving repentant Jews, and thereby giving a mild rebuke but merciful suggestion to the objecting self-righteous Pharisees and scribes, Jesus gave the parables of the lost sheep and the lost piece of silver. Then he followed these up with the further parable of the prodigal. (Luke 15:11-32) The parables of the sheep and the silver piece showed the search made by the loser for that which was lost, followed by great rejoicing on finding such. The parable of the prodigal shows what this lost one must do, and heavenly rejoicing over his doing so. It is a parable in vindication of God’s name and purpose, showing that Satan’s organization cannot prevent earthly creatures from taking their stand on the side of the Kingdom in this day, nor prevent Jehovah from receiving such sinners.

Regardless of this loving-kindness to the “other sheep” class today for their salvation the promises of the heavenly inheritance for the spiritual remnant still remain secure, even though not treated and discussed so exclusively now. So be like Joseph in his treatment toward his repentant ten half brothers. The occasion calls for Godlike mercy from those who themselves have experienced the Father’s mercy. It calls also for generosity and brotherly kindness toward the “other sheep”, and for a self-forgetting joy at the vindication of Jehovah’s name and word.

The citizens of the “holy nation” God admonishes: “Be ye holy; for I am holy.” His nation must be holy, that is, devoted to the righteousness of His purpose, and pure and clean from contamination by this world and its nations. The “holy nation” must therefore worship Jehovah as its God, and have no other gods before Him. It must keep his commandments above all, if it would remain holy and do no unrighteousness.

That issue was and is God’s universal domination, which the jealous adversary, Satan, has challenged before all creation. Jesus’ mind or purpose was one of perfect and complete devotion to his Father’s universal domination, from which mind it was impossible by any satanic means to swerve him. Satan had grossly sinned in challenging Jehovah’s universal domination and putting it in doubt in the minds of men and legions of angels. So it would be sin for Jesus and his followers to question and depart from under the rightful domination of Jehovah God and to worship and serve any other than Him.

He does it for the sake of no filthy lucre, nor for any selfish gain possible to get out of it, but for his love of God and the Kingdom. No one should associate himself with God’s organization for personal gain; for, if he tries to do so, he will lose all. One must have love for God and his children, because without love for the brethren one gains nothing that endures.

His ambassadors are not sent directly to the diplomatic or political courts of this old world. They are dispatched directly to the people in their homes. This is because none of the nations will survive as such into the new world. Hence each individual must make his own decision, accepting or rejecting the good news and then taking the consequences. Thereby the individual is afforded the opportunity to escape destruction with the nations in the universal conflict that will shortly break forth over the domination of the universe.

There is a very present need of instruction in truth and righteousness. It is due to the fact that error, with its results of sin and death, has invaded the earth, and that the “father of lies’’, Satan the Devil, has since deceived the whole world by religious instruction. Hence right instruction must often take the form of reproof, exposing the errors of religion. For correct and life-giving teaching the meek person must look upward to Jehovah God. (Prov. 15: 24) Jehovah interests himself in such as thus seek light and truth: “the meek will he teach his way.” For the meek the great Supervisor of essential education has provided ample learning.

No creature desires to lose his liberty. It is solely his loss of understanding that could cause the creature to forsake the will of the One who made him and gave him life to enjoy. Therefore, the wicked enslaver, Satan, must present himself as a liberator in order to induce other creatures to forsake the laws of Jehovah and to cast in their lot with God’s opposer.

If Lucifer had exercised the power of death upon disobedient Adam and Eve, it would have meant Lucifer’s acting as God’s executioner to execute everlasting destruction or extinction upon that unfaithful pair. Now, however, the power of death such as Satan has been permitted to exercise in many cases against God’s servants and witnesses extends only to the killing of the body.

Then the Good Shepherd brings such persons of good-will unto his fold or organization. They become the “stranger that is within thy gates” of spiritual Israel. The spiritual Israelites use great hospitality toward these “strangers” in serving them the spiritual food from the Lord’s table.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things.—Isa. 25:6, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This feast strengthens Jehovah’s remnant of anointed witnesses. It enables them to endure the heat in the dry place of this world and to keep on their feet and push onward through the stormblasts of opposition and violence. But it is not for them alone. Jehovah makes the feast of fat things unto all peoples, regardless of nationality. Of course, this means “all peoples” who are of good-will toward Jehovah and his Theocracy under his Anointed King. This fact shows, too, its correspondence with the “feast of ingathering” or “feast of tabernacles”, such as King Solomon kept at the temple dedication. At that feast the non-Israelite “stranger” was welcome and was bidden to rejoice with God’s covenant people. Its being to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“all peoples” </span><span class="font5">shows it coincides with carrying out Jesus’ prophetic words at Matthew 24:14. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

For their common devotion to God and his King they love one another. They express this love by unselfishly aiding one another to serve God and to keep covenant with him and to have a part in vindicating his name, and to so gain salvation to endless life. They are compassionate or sympathetic toward one another in their difficulties and in their efforts to keep their integrity to God despite trials. They love one another, not according to mere fleshly attachments, but as brethren in the Lord. Having received God’s mercy and tasted of Christ’s pity, they show mercy and pity to one another.

<p><span class="font5">As foreshadowed by Enoch, God will deliver the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses today from the murderous attempts of the religionists and will reserve them for his service. He will permit the remnant to survive the Armageddon fight with his “other sheep” and to see the New Earth, wherein “there shall be no more death”. Then the Lord God will take them. They must carry out their consecration to God in faithfulness even to death. They will not sleep in death waiting for the coming of the Seed of God’s woman, but will have an instantaneous resurrection to life in the spirit. They “shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump”. Deathlessness, immortality, in the spirit will be their portion, a testimony that they have been well-pleasing to God because of now walking with God, ‘T&gt;y faith, not by sight.”—1 Cor. 15: 51-54; 2 Cor. 5: 7.

<p><span class="font5">Ancient Jerusalem became crowned with glory when David had the ark of Jehovah’s testimony removed from its temporary abiding-place and brought to the city and placed in the tent he pitched for it on Mount Zion, the city of David. Thereafter Jehovah God made with this faithful Theocratic ruler the covenant for the kingdom. King David, therefore, was a type of the everlasting King, the resurrected and exalted Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah placed upon the throne of The Theocratic Government in 1914. Jerusalem the faithful was typical of that strong and stable Government. No mere global or supernational government is that, but it is the capital organization of all the universe. It has come forth from the womb of Jehovah’s universal organization of holy creatures, over whom it thereafter reigns. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God’s written Word needs no addition of oral traditions, because such oral traditions of men prove to be lies that make the written Word of God of none effect. Before the church of Christ came into existence, the Bible existed, that is, the Hebrew part of it. With the prophet Moses the line of writing prophets began, so far as the Bible’s own account shows. He was inspired to write the first five books of the Bible. When Moses wrote, he embodied all traditions from men of faith before him in the record. The spirit of inspiration of God caused Moses to discard all traditions of men which were at variance with God’s declared purpose, and to set down in writing the truthful record. Such would be to the glory of God and for the instruction and safe guidance of Jehovah God’s covenant people. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.—Dan. 4:3. </span><span class="font5">Jehovah God has a grand organization in the invisible heavens, of cherubim, seraphim, angels, principalities and powers, all of which are governed by him through his Son Jesus Christ in an orderly manner. (1 Pet. 3:21,22) Under him certain heavenly creatures are put in positions more responsible than those of others, to look after their part of the organization and to see that the work assigned to them is properly handled. It is through organization and co-operation one with another and in unity of mind and purpose that much is accomplished. The rebellion of the mighty spirit creature, Lucifer, and his satanic secession from God’s heavenly organization followed up by his devilish attacks upon it, have failed to break up the good order and successful operation of Jehovah’s living organization.

<p><span class="font5">The “vine” represents the royal family of God, of which Christ Jesus is the Chief or Head Son. The fruit of the vine brings joy, because the purpose of the vine is to glorify God. As to this vine of many sons the Father is interested in their faithful service and their productive qualities and powers. If they do not bear fruit they are removed from the Theocratic organization, the “body of Christ”. If they bear fruit, they are pruned to produce or hold forth still more fruit. To this end He chastens the sons, because reproof and instruction are the way of life. Thereby the creature is put in better position to serve and hold forth the Kingdom fruit or truth. As long as the disciples abide in Christ as Head, King and Leader, then they are able to bear fruit, because the branch must always be a part of the vine. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Without any fear of “the king of the north”, imperial Rome, Christ Jesus continued to worship the Lord his God by serving as Jehovah’s witness and bearing testimony to the truth about his Father’s name and kingdom, the throne of which his Father had anointed him to occupy. Jesus declared that witnessing was the chief purpose for which his Father sent him and for which he came. His refusal of Satan’s bribe in the mount of temptation showed he had no seditious designs against “the king of the north” and had no interest in worldly politics, and was not backing up even “the king of the north’s” continual opponent. Jesus stood for a third thing, entirely separate from the world, and that was the Kingdom of God. Jesus refused to violate his commission or anointing to preach the gospel.

<p><span class="font5">The breaking pictures the affliction which Christ Jesus suffered and which his body members must suffer with him. The affliction comes upon them because of being on Jehovah’s side as “faithful and true” witnesses for Him and his kingdom. These “fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ . . . for his body’s sake, which is the church”. (Col. 1: 24) The bread Jesus broke was unleavened bread from the Passover feast, and was called the “bread of affliction”. As stated at Deuteronomy 16:3: “Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction.” Eating of such broken bread pictured partaking of the afflictions such as came upon Jesus and thus following in his footsteps as an ambassador for God’s kingdom and as a witness for His name.

<p><span class="font5">Arm yourselves with the purpose and determination not to leave any loopholes for the invasion of the sin of disloyalty and rebellion, nor to indulge any weakness which the demons can play upon to the undermining of your strength of purpose. Turn your back upon sin. That means, you must serve the Lord, not merely by being clean in thought, word and action, but by keeping his commandments to declare his name and to bear testimony to the Kingdom. (Ps. 119: 2, 3) When we are serving the Lord in diligent performance of his commandments, then we are not sinning. We cease from sin; and the demons of malicious intent do not have the chance to take advantage of us and to overreach us and trap us into sin. They can only cause us suffering.

<p><span class="font5">Almighty God has assigned the homes and houses of the people for visitation by those who leave their own home and home folks for Christ’s sake and the gospel’s, to imitate Christ’s example and to preach the gospel. God does not literally hand over houses to a hundredfold extent to any Christian who stays at home trying to mind his own business, and not God’s business. In order to “receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses”, and so forth, the Christian must go out from his own house for the gospel’s sake and imitate Christ Jesus and call upon the houses of those prospective brethren, sisters, mothers, children, and relatives of the household of faith, and not fear the persecutions at the hands of religionists on account of such door-to-door calls.

<p><span class="font5">God warned Israel against being unequally yoked with religionists, because their nation could not exist free and at the same time be allied with religion’s slaves. God’s law is the “law of liberty” from sin, religion and Devil. If the Israelites thought they were not free in being under the law to serve Jehovah, then when they rebelled against his Theocratic law and rulership and attached themselves to religion they always found it led them into sore bondage to the Devil and his demons and religious dupes on earth. Without exception religion proved to be a snare to catch them into bondage. They came under great oppression. Repeatedly Jehovah displayed himself as the God of freedom by liberating them from religion and religionists. He raised up to them deliverers.—Judg. 2:11-19, 3. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Lord God specifically provided for the education both of his covenant people and of strangers within their gates. It was the highest and most necessary education, that of the law and the purposes and promises of God, in order that they might be safeguarded against religion and might worship and serve Jehovah alone. Not only must the tribe of Levi, its priests and Levites, act as teachers of the adults, but the parents must instruct their children from early childhood onward in the holy scriptures. This sets the rule for every parent today who has consecrated himself to God and is thereby in a covenant with the great Life-giver. Such parent must instruct his offspring in God’s Word.

<p><span class="font5">The remnant and their companions are walking openly before all the world in the “land of uprightness” as witnesses to the majesty of God’s kingdom; and Jehovah has manifestly uplifted his hand for their deliverance, protection, guidance and prosperity in His service. The religionists have been able to observe all this zeal of Jehovah’s people and to profit by it, if they will. But do they? The prophecy answers No. The remnant and their companions shun all dealings with such wicked ones and waste no consecrated time in controversies with them, but let them go their own willful, stubborn way and take the consequences of which they have been forewarned.

Those who lacked desire and zeal for the Kingdom would hear but make no effort to search or inquire for the meaning so as to follow up the matter and act upon it. They heard and did not perceive, and finally what information and opportunities they had were taken away from them. The parables screened them out as unfit for God’s kingdom. Those who had a genuine interest would seek to understand the Kingdom parables and would ask for further information from God and through his Representative.

God’s servant may be engaged in His service from house to house, meeting unabating opposition or unresponsiveness; he may be threatened with violence as he persists in giving the witness. Then, whether he be at a doorstep needing heavenly grace, or be walking on the street to his field work, he may silently within his heart lift his requests to God. The Lord who knows what is in the heart of man can and will hear, and the good hand of the Lord will be upon his servant, as it was upon Nehemiah.

<p><span class="font5">It is falsely charged that Jehovah’s witnesses manufacture and set up their own laws and have contempt for the laws of earthly governments. If Jehovah’s witnesses were to make their own laws governing their conduct such laws would not be Theocratic, because Theocratic law is of God and is right, perfect and supreme. Their being “sojourners and pilgrims” here means they must respect the laws of the land and be peaceful, orderly and law-abiding to the extent that such human laws do not go contrary to the supreme, divine law. Were they to renounce their heavenward allegiance it would mean destruction for them, and hence they must render first to God that which is God’s, and then to “Caesar” that which is “Caesar’s”. “Caesar” has no right, nor does it belong to “Caesar”, to compel such Christian “strangers and pilgrims” to obey his laws when such laws conflict with the law of the Theocratic Higher Powers.

<p><span class="font5">By sending forth Jehovah’s witnesses to all the world to preach the established kingdom of God to all countries, the royal Judge Christ Jesus has gathered all nations before his throne. He has turned his attention toward them. Although the blinded and unbelieving nations do not actually see the King and Judge upon his throne, yet by his message proclaimed to them the nations have been put on notice that Jehovah’s King was enthroned in 1914 and that now Jehovah commands all rulers and nations to &quot;fear God” and “honour the King” and to submit to these two “Higher Powers”. The fact that all the nations hate and persecute Jehovah’s witnesses is ample evidence that those nations have taken notice of the Kingdom message.

<p><span class="font5">Being reproached by religionists does not disprove one’s blessed or happy estate, but does prove they are anti-Christ. It proves that the one reproached for Christ’s name or kingly office is on the right side. “Blessed” means “being in the right and straightforward way”, and hence having God’s approval and favor and enjoying real prosperity from him and sure in the end to reach the right destination, worthiness of life and happiness in the New World. The reproach would be insupportable were it not that Jehovah puts his glorious spirit upon those who bear such reproach rather than please themselves. The honor of having his glorious spirit rest upon them and work in them both to will and to do of his good pleasure is a blessed privilege. Thereby God protects them from being possessed with the spirit of the demons. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

He must live up to what he professes when drinking and eating at the Lord’s supper before witnesses. He must meet the terms of the new covenant by being actively a part of the “people for his name” and declaring Jehovah’s name throughout the earth. He must meet the terms of the Kingdom covenant by being Jehovah’s witness as His King was, continually preaching that Kingdom now at the end of the world and increasing the Kingdom interests entrusted to him.

<p><span class="font5">It is the truth, mixed with the love of the truth, that brings Jesus’ followers to a oneness of mind; and that truth is found in Jehovah’s Word, the Bible. Only one thing brings unity into the understanding of the Bible, and that is the discernment of God’s purpose to establish his kingdom by Christ Jesus and to vindicate his name by it. There is only one thing around which to unite in oneness of mind; that is The Theocracy of Jehovah God through his Son, the King. There is only one people where today such unity of mind prevails; it is Jehovah’s people upon whom his name is called, namely, his witnesses. These have come out from all religious sects as well as all nationalities; but they are now all of one mind, because they have consecrated themselves wholly to Jehovah God and rally about his Theocracy.

<p><span class="font5">The factual proof is that Christ Jesus has approved and laid his hands upon the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses as his visible representatives and has united them with himself at the temple. Thus since 1918 they constitute with him and under him the “faithful and wise servant” class. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Ruler over all the Kingdom “goods” or interests, and the Ruler has entrusted those interests on earth to the faithful and wise remnant. Their prime responsibility is to ‘preach this gospel of the kingdom’ to the meek and to bear forth the “meat in due season” which the King supplies to them. This they must supply to the Lord’s “other sheep”. To such end Jehovah God has by Christ Jesus anointed the “servant” class with his spirit in fulfillment of his prophecy. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

To yield would mean to bow in bondage to Satan’s organization and to demonism. It would mean becoming bondservants to the sin of rebellion against God and of treason against his universal domination. Christ Jesus, by his ransom sacrifice and his truth revealed since coming to the temple in 1918, has made us free, but not that we might choose again the bondage of religion and of sin and thereby relapse back under the power of Satan and his demons and doomed world.

The creature is simply giving an outward sign, according to God’s commandment through Jesus Christ, and before witnesses, a sign of what has taken place in the heart, namely, unconditional and unreserved consecration to God through his Son.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 10:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pieces of the broken bread Jesus offered only to those in line to be members of the Kingdom, the “body of Christ”. Accepting a piece of the bread and eating it did not mean merely believing in the sacrificed humanity of Christ Jesus and being justified by faith therein. Those in line for the Kingdom as members of Christ’s body must already be thus justified by faith in Christ Jesus as the Savior and Ransomer before they can be put in the way of the Kingdom opportunities. Hence partaking of the bread means to have part in the body of Christ and accepting a God-given assignment in that body and thankfully undertaking and joyfully carrying out the obligations of being </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">member in the body.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 15:25,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those taking such a position are too much concerned about themselves or the spiritual class with whom they have worked. They overlook other parts of the heavenly Father’s present merciful purposes. They see not that the feast of rejoicing over the incoming of the “prodigal son” class is not to glorify and exalt that class as superior and of more importance than the spirit-begotten sons of God, but is to glorify Jehovah’s tender compassions. It is in vindication of His name, because the bringing in of these “other sheep” proves God’s Word of prophecy as true. It proves the Devil a liar who boasted he could turn all men away from God and prevent any from seeking and taking their stand on his side and abiding there in integrity, during a time of Devil-sent woe.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.—Rev. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression “the blood of the Lamb” may mean more than merely faith in Jesus’ blood as the price of their redemption and the means of their daily forgiveness and cleansing from sin. It means also their participation in the death of Christ Jesus. While thus dying daily with him, they give forth “the word of their testimony”, which is “the testimony of Jesus Christ”. He shares with the remnant of his body members the delivering of this testimony concerning Jehovah’s name. Hence they go from place to place and from house to house as He and his apostles did. They are wholly unselfish in this. Hence in pressing aggressively forward in such witness work in the face of demoniacal persecution and tribulation they “loved not their lives unto the death”.

<p><span class="font5">As the broken bread was used to symbolize something larger than his flesh, so the cup of wine was used to symbolize something more inclusive than his literal blood. Blood in the vessels of the body signifies life: “for the life of the flesh is in the blood.” “Eat not the blood: for the blood is the life.” (Lev. 17:11; Deut. 12:23) Hence blood poured out means life shed, death. The contents of the cup which Jesus handed to his disciples symbolized his blood poured out, or his death and the sufferings therewith. The drinking out of the cup means meeting the requirements to enter into the Kingdom. Not only the shed blood, as pictured by the wine in the cup, meant death, but the drinking of the real cup by those taking part in the Lord’s supper also means death. It means their death with Christ, their participation in his death. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Being sober means being steady, and hence able to be relied upon; being regular, calm and unexcited, and serious and in earnest concerning all Theocratic matters committed to one’s care. The sober person will not be intoxicated and swayed by the dizzy pleasures and entangling, enticing things of this world. He always keeps his mind stayed upon the truths of God and his kingdom. Each one seeking to keep covenant with God will be vigilant, or alert and attentive, so as to detect and avoid dangers and to pursue the safe way. He will be observing and cautious. He will be of this frame of mind knowing that the Devil, roaring out his threatenings, tries to intimidate and turn the consecrated ones away from God’s service.

<p><span class="font5">The branch receives the fruit from the King and then holds it forth to God’s glory and to others’ spiritual sustenance. None could ever separate himself from the “Vine” and expect to bear fruit; for the source of his life is thereby cut off. Every “branch” must cleave to the Theocratic organization which God has formed and must bear Kingdom fruit. The branch must always give recognition to the Head, Christ Jesus, even as Christ Jesus looks to his Head, Jehovah. (1 Cor. 11:3) Now the “fruit” of the “vine” consists of preaching this gospel of the established Kingdom in all the world for a witness to all nations, thus glorifying God. By following Christ’s example of service and keeping his commandments, the branches will bear much fruit. Through their unity and close co-ordination with Christ, God is glorified.

<p><span class="font5">The Ephraimite fugitive was “not prepared to speak right”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)</span><span class="font5"> Neither is the “evil servant” class so prepared. They may pronounce the words “Theocracy”, “the present truth,” “redemption,” “salvation,” “restitution,” and “higher powers”, but the meaning that the “evil servant” class give to these words lacks the advanced light on Bible truth since the death of their professed leader in 1916. The meaning they give is marked by honor to human creatures, by “character development”, by traditions and religious formalities, and by a compromising “respectable appearance” before the world. Hence they cannot “speak right” the Bible truths according to what the Theocratic organization and rule under Christ require. This inability betrays them as members of the “man of sin” class. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

They assume to undertake and to bring about on earth that which Jehovah God has assigned to Christ Jesus to do and which God’s Word promises that only his Son can and will do. Thereby such religious, political, commercial men put themselves in the role of Christ, anointing themselves or other men to the mighty task of world reconstruction, apart from the direct intervention of Jesus Christ. They oil their proposals with a lot of pious phrases to sound religious. It behooves the lovers of life and righteousness to hearken to the words of Jehovah’s great Prophet.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, the King of the New World, chose to suffer in the flesh, that he might uphold God’s side of the universal controversy and prove worthy to be the Head of the kingdom. The lover of God and his New World will not flinch before the prospect of sufferings for living for the New World. He will look unto Jesus, who “also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps”. (1 Pet. 2:21) All you who are devoted to the vindication of God’s name will “arm yourselves likewise with the same mind”, “with the same purpose.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> That mind is to be submissive to God’s will, though it entails suffering at the hands of the Devil’s crowd; and to seek always the glory and vindication of God and to abide by his universal domination now and ever.

<p><span class="font5">When Paul delivered to listeners of good-will the oral traditions concerning Christ he did not do so independently of the Bible. He did not preach contrary to it or to what he himself had previously written under inspiration of God. (Gal. 1: 6-9) Neither did the true believers accept his oral tradition without proof from God’s recorded Word. Religionists at Thessa-lonica, who swallowed without Scripture proof the traditions of their religious fathers, rejected the message Paul spoke, whereas persons of good-will at Berea accepted Paul’s message. Why? Because they did not consider themselves independent of the Bible. “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.”—Acts 17:11.

By his covenant he set up over them a typical Theocratic government. The God whom they worshiped was therefore also their Ruler and King. They were thus God’s visible organization on earth. In wisdom their King did not permit them to have a divided worship, letting them worship Him wheresoever each tribe pleased. At the place where God caused his tabernacle to be located, thither they must go up and worship him regularly. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s day is Freedom’s day! It begins with the birth of the free Nation. Mighty blows for freedom throughout the universe follow, struck by that nation. The field of action is heaven and earth. Heaven first feels the joy of the clearing out of the enemy. The free Nation, clothed with power and authority and bringing salvation to men, is the kingdom of God’s Anointed One, God’s most highly exalted Son, who now enters in actively upon his authority. The Nation’s Father is Jehovah God, who bestows the kingdom upon his Son.

Instead of a shortage of teachers in the all-essential instruction of the Kingdom; instead of Christians’ being enticed away from the work of giving Kingdom instruction to get larger financial returns by another occupation, there should be more Kingdom publishers in the field, giving witness to all nations. Christ Jesus, the great Teacher, left us the example in his own choice of exclusive life-occupation, and also left us his command what to do. In view of the Kingdom’s establishment, and the imminence of the battle of Armageddon, and the glorious incoming of the new world, war years and the postwar era should witness the expansion of education in the most vital field of human interest as never before.

Such course is according to a desire for all the selfish enjoyment one can get out of life unbridled by any covenant obligations toward God. It brings one nought but spiritual impoverishment.

His honesty to his “master” is a testimony to his faith. Although a Christian is in the service-employ of a master “according to the flesh”, yet he is primarily a servant of God and must be an active publisher of the Kingdom as Christ Jesus was on earth ; and he so acts aside from his earthly employment. Such Christian has made a full consecration of himself to God through Christ Jesus, who bought him with his own precious blood. So, regardless of the dislike or objections of earthly employers, he seeks to be faithful to the obligations of his consecration to serve God conscientiously as Jesus set the example.

The situation calls now for a quick and right decision. Foolish now for any of Jehovah’s witnesses to grow careless and loose and to mingle with the world and fall victim to the demons and to suffer as a thief, murderer, evildoer, or busybody, thereby proving “disobedient to the glad tidings of God”. That spells disaster for such. Those of the house of God, or any professing to be thereof, who descend to such a course put themselves in line for early destruction; for execution of judgment begins first at God’s house or “sanctuary”.

That </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">servant</span><span class="font5"> company he makes ruler over his household as to the dispensing of the spiritual food and the conducting of the work of the household members.

(1 Cor. 1:13; 12:12; 14: 33) The great God and Father of the household of faith has only one visible organization which he uses as his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">servant</span><span class="font5"> channel to convey “food in due season”.

That was not God’s way for his Son to fulfill the preaching commission that Jesus read out of Isaiah’s prophecy. Were there not the thousands of homes of the people to visit and to preach in? Jesus was without a personal copy of the Bible while preaching, yet “his word was with power”; “for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.” This was because Jesus quoted the Scriptures, and not the traditions of men, as authority. When at Jerusalem Jesus preached also in the temple. It was no religious denominational house, but was supported by all the Jewish nation. As a taxpayer Jesus acted on his right to preach in it.

With what very little of the revealed word of God Abel had, he yet exercised faith in Jehovah. Abel is therefore an example to those today who likewise manifest faith in Jehovah God and worship him.

The Lord’s supper was meant to stress the requirements for admitting one into that kingdom and reigning therein. The meeting of such requirements faithfully serves for a vindication of Jehovah’s name and proves the Devil a blasphemer of that name. Redemption and the remitting of the sins of those who are granted to sit with Christ Jesus in his kingdom finds a place in the arrangement, but this is secondary. To redeem them the King himself served as “the Lamb of God” whose blood is shed for cleansing them from sin and to make valid a new covenant.

They have a right to access to the people. The people have a God-given right to hear and receive the message of hope at the lips and hands of the Lord’s witnesses, for God has sent forth the message that it might be freely given to the people. “Freely ye have received; freely give.” That could not mean being subject to a license tax or a declaration of illegality by a government of religion-blinded men. God’s witnesses have been made his “watchman” to give the people warning from Him. For the watchman to draw back in fear or to willfully neglect or fail to sound the warning loud and unmistakably would be criminal negligence on his part in God’s sight. It would mean disobedience to his commission and would merit his own destruction. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

When asked as to the evidences that should mark the end of the world, he foretold to his disciples the World War, the famines, the earthquakes, the pestilences, and the persecution of his faithful followers. What did he then foretell should be the pursuit that his followers should take up after world war? What education did he emphasize exclusively as of first importance, yes, of all-importance in the postwar period? With unmistakable simplicity he marked out the specialized course of education of immediate value and necessity to all peoples when he said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The apostle was addressing those within God’s organization and was exhorting them to pray in behalf of conditions within God’s organization, that quiet and peaceable living in all godliness and honesty might be led by all members of the organization. Why ? Because God will have such to be saved, and Christ Jesus is the Mediator between Him and them in that behalf. Those who are in authority or in high station within the visible part of the organization need our prayers and supplications and intercessions to God, that they may conduct themselves in favor of the peace and spiritual health and prosperity of “all men”, Christians in the flesh, in the organization. Such prayer is for God’s glory. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

(Eph. 4:3) Resisting religion and its divisive force they shall be able to do so, by God’s grace. There is no room for religion in The Theocracy. As faithful Jerusalem contained the temple and was the capital seat of Jehovah’s worship, so The Theocratic Government incorporates within itself the faithful worship of the Most High God.

<p><span class="font5">The “faithful and wise steward” is not an individual man on earth. Likewise “that evil servant” is not any individual person, but represents a class of persons taking a common course of evil action and sharing a like destiny. “That evil servant” means a class of men and women once </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">servants</span><span class="font5"> of Jehovah God and associated with his visible organization. They once devoted themselves to God in consecration and were begotten of his spirit and taken into his household as spiritual sons and were for a time apparently faithful. But they do not endure to the end in God’s service, and turn evil. At the time that the Lord begins judgment at the temple their evil conduct is exposed. So they manifested themselves from and after 1918. Their trouble begins with the heart, the seat of affection and motivation. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">They became alive from the dead condition by having the Kingdom gospel preached to them and responding thereto with belief and obedience toward God and his King Christ Jesus. The time past of their lives they practiced and served sin, but now they forsook the course of the world. They determined that for the rest of their time in the flesh they would no longer live in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to God’s will. That was the very reason for which the gospel was preached to them by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. They live to God by works of righteousness. (Rom. 8: 9,10) Those now becoming the Lord’s “other sheep” were also once dead in trespasses and sin ; but the Good Shepherd has put them on his right side in the pathway to life, life on earth in the New World. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jephthah’s campaign against those demon-worshipers pictured the spiritual fight of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization under Christ Jesus the Head. It is to maintain Jehovah’s worship and to carry on his work to the finish against the unwarranted limitations and encroachments by the totalitarian forces at this time. At his coming to the temple Christ Jesus found a faithful remnant, and such he has designated and appointed as the “faithful and wise servant” under him. To such servant class he has committed his Kingdom interests on earth. Thereby the “faithful and wise servant” class is the visible Theocratic organization on earth under Christ Jesus. Its work is to declare Jehovah’s name throughout all the earth and to publish the good news of The Theocracy now established. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With the charge of Kingdom activities posted above his head on the tree, Jehovah’s “Faithful and True Witness” died, proving that the Kingdom and the vindication of Jehovah’s name by that kingdom are more important than human salvation and that such issues are the cause for which he suffered at the hands of the wicked. In thus enduring the sufferings for God’s name and kingdom without committing the sin of rebellion against God and ruining his integrity, Jesus left the proper pattern for all his followers who will be associated with him in the Kingdom. Suffering for any other cause would be without effect in God’s sight, that is, not affording the sufferer a share with Christ Jesus in the vindication of his Father’s name. The Kingdom issue determines what must be or what constitutes Christ’s sufferings. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">If the apostles knew Jesus, who reflected the Father and declared His name, they then knew also his Father. At all times Jesus spoke of his Father, because He is Jehovah. Jesus told them why he came to earth, and who sent him on this mission, and that his chief purpose in life was to honor his Father’s name. Therefore if they knew the Son they must, of necessity, know the Son’s Father. They could not come to the Father except by Jesus, because he is the Vindicator of his Father’s name and is Mediator between God and man. He is the One who brings forth the truth concerning that holy name and the purpose for which it stands. He provides in himself the way that all believers may come to the Father. He is the Word of God, and God’s Word is always true. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

Courage! Steady! Endure to the end, holding fast your integrity. The called and elect remnant have this sure promise: “The God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.” (1 Pet. 5:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> He will also perfect, establish and strengthen in their integrity the “other sheep”, who faithfully abide as constant companions of the remnant, joyfully sharing the like sufferings with them.

The house-to-house work of Jehovah’s witnesses is not new, but is more than nineteen hundred years old. It appears “strange”, undignified, and un-Christlike to religionists solely because of their blindness. The fact is, it was introduced by Jesus Christ himself, who pioneered in it. It is part of the Theocratic rule and procedure he himself brought in under command of his Father, the great Theocrat. Very few Bible readers seem to have noticed the house-to-house and back-call work that Jesus our Exemplar did. In the 114 to 116 pages of the four Gospel accounts of Jesus’ ministry the words </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">house </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">home</span><span class="font5"> appear more than 130 times, and in the majority of those times it is in connection with the preaching of Jesus.

No; it is the good news from God’s Word published by Jehovah’s witnesses during this time of ‘shortening the days of the great tribulation’. The news tells of the life-providing spiritual abundance that exists among the household of Jehovah God, the Giver of life. It shows how those who serve Him are happy and well taken care of and have glorious hopes of life amid peace and prosperity in the New World. This information, so long in the discard by neglect, indifference and worldly cares, the “prodigal” class now consider with new interest. It opens their eyes to discern the difference between those living now for the old world and those serving the life-giving Jehovah in the interest of his New World.

<p><span class="font5">Why did the apostle Paul, and those who follow him as he followed Christ, suffer many things? Because they are not of this political, commercial, religious world, but stand solidly for God’s kingdom and preach it for a witness to all nations, both publicly and by going from house to house. It is because they are commissioned as ministers of God and of Christ, and they put this ministry first. They permit nothing to interfere with their carrying on as ministers to preach the good news of Jehovah’s Righteous Government that brings lasting peace and relief to all believing, obedient men on earth. Nothing can make them throw up His commission to preach the gospel and quit the ministry, thereby bringing reproach upon it and God.

However, such was foretold and is proof positive that you are on the right side and are in the pathway to life in a worthwhile and perfect world. Christ Jesus is the “foundation” which God laid for that New World, and Jesus counted it worthy of suffering for and dying at the hands of sinners. Can those who now follow him and prove worthy expect to gain life and blessings in that world in the easy way ? Did he suffer and die to make it easy for us? No; but to show what it takes, and to leave us an example that we should follow his steps. By so doing, we too shall win, to God’s glory. Arm yourselves accordingly with his mind.

Carnal weapons can never destroy the demons or their doctrines of darkness. The weapons of Christians are those of the-light of truth and are ‘mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds of error’. When persecuted, reviled and evil entreated, they give “contrariwise, blessing”. Not that they say “God bless you” to those who wrongfully abuse them. Instead, they take the course which should result in a blessing and lead to repentance anyone who mistreats them under instigation of the religious leaders and demons but who is misinformed and not malicious. That is, they show forth an example of loyalty and faithfulness to the Most High God and Christ Jesus.

That being so, then a servant or an “elder” in any capacity may not rightly think himself better than his brethren, nor think too highly of himself. He soberly realizes that the Kingdom publisher who goes from house to house and who accepts from God the commission to do this as an ordained minister is the one actually doing the important Christian work in the earth, and not an elder who merely holds down an office.

She took up with the precepts of men and with traditions of teachers who put their own and other men’s interpretations and philosophies above God’s Word. This blinded the Jews to the true sense of His Word and laws and led to the development of a clergy class.

It is of “The Kingdom” here, fully born! In 1914, the due time having come, the New Government was born instantaneously, at God’s command.

The stronger should be considerate and help the weaker, that such may become strong to ‘bear everyone his own burden’ toward the Lord. Especially should this indivisible unity and loving helpfulness be true of the household of faith, where relationship to one another is based on faith and faithfulness.

He sees to it that the feast is spread “in faithfulness and truth” and that his invited guests get to it. This feast is spread and enjoyed before Armageddon’s fight. It is one of the “wonderful things” Jehovah of hosts does on His day when his hosts are mustered up for the great decisive fight for the vindication of His name. The hostility of all the nations, and their gathering together against God’s holy mountain, Zion, to prevent its universal domination, is not permitted to disturb the feast or postpone it. Jehovah laughs at the raging and vain imaginations of the opposing peoples and nations and says: “Yet I have installed my king, on Zion my holy mountain.” (Ps. 2:1-6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.) </span><span class="font5">Hence, on with the feast! 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The only education that will enable the people to defend and preserve true freedom and that will equip them for endless life and peace is from Jehovah and by Christ Jesus. According to God’s Word the postwar period will not be very long, though men propose to make it a thousand years long. Democracy or any other form of government will last no longer than the postwar era. Yet fear not: the New World which God establishes thereafter will have such lasting foundations that it cannot be moved, for ever. It will be Theocratic. The education that the peoples of all nations need now and in the coming era must be concerning what is of highest importance to them. That is Jehovah’s Theocracy, the kingdom of God exercised through his Son and King, Christ Jesus. Such education prepares and fits “men of good-will” for life in the New World. That life will be without end. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There are two classes from among sinful men that inherit life everlasting as sons of God. There is a spiritual class called to the Kingdom; and an earthly class that gain life after the Kingdom’s establishment and that inherit God’s blessings on earth under that heavenly Government. Such two classes are pictured by the two sons of the certain man. His “elder son” pictures those in line for the kingly inheritance, they having consecrated themselves to God and been begotten by his spirit as his spiritual sons. (1 John 3:1,2) The younger son represents a class in line for redemption by the blood of Christ’s ransom sacrifice. He pictures only such of these as appear on the scene in the fulfillment of the parable, namely, those who become the Good Shepherd’s “other sheep” and whom he brings into company with the remnant of the “little flock”. —John 10:16.

Does the course of challenging the world and its totalitarian demands, and doing so out of faithfulness to God and his standard of righteousness? or does the course of weakly conforming to the world’s ways and demands and obeying men rather than God so as to avoid the fiery trial? God’s Word shows the right answer. Soon, his preservation of the faithful remnant and their companions clear through the tribulation of Armageddon, and the utter destruction of the persecutors and opposers there, will provide a final and climactic answer.

They do not permit such abusive speaking to swerve them from doing God’s will as his servants and witnesses. They bear such reproaches as Christ bore them. It would be ruinous for Christians, who have sincerely made a covenant with the Lord God, to compromise with this world for any selfish reason and to go in the ways of its wanton living, unlawful relationships, loose conduct, revelings, jazz parties, excessive drinking, tobacco smoking, etc. Such ones as do so become the victims of the demons and will with them be destroyed, perishing like a dog and a sow in their filthiness. They are covenant-breakers worthy of death. (2 Pet. 2:20-22; Rom. 1:31,32) They bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name and show ingratitude and contempt for his mercies and New World. W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The criticalness of the times urges a generous use of all the faculties, provisions and equipment with which Jehovah God has endowed his servants. We are stewards of whatever the Lord God has put in our hand for use in his service; and this grace or favor to us is shown in “manifold” ways, differing to each one favored. If we have made a full consecration of all that we are and have to our God and Creator, Jehovah God expects and requires us to put our faculties, abilities and gifts to use in harmony with his purpose. We must “minister the same to one another”, that is, to all who take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom by Christ. So doing, we prove ourselves “good stewards” of what his loving-kindness confers upon us.—1 Cor. 4:2. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All members of the flock are accountable to God the Father. Why, then, should anyone holding a position of servant in a company play the lord over others or try to make other Christians subject and subservient to him? To do so means to try to usurp God’s position as to his flock. Keep clearly in mind that the essential and fundamental service of His organization is to be Jehovah’s witness, which means being a publisher proclaiming His name and kingdom. That is honor and privilege enough over which to rejoice. So rejoicing, you will not demand extra honors and services from fellow publishers because you may represent the Lord in any additional capacity among them. Then you will not try to take to yourself what belongs to God. If, however, you try to lord or lady it over His heritage, you are sure to forfeit all and in due time be cast out therefrom as unworthy.

<p><span class="font5">Any opposer of Jehovah and his will cannot be a true advocate of liberty. The great adversary of God can be nothing else but the foe of freedom and must be and is the wicked oppressor. Satan the Devil is the god of slavery. Any effort to be independent of Jehovah does not bring absolute freedom to the self-willed creature, but means only loss of liberty into the servitude of the Devil. Such enslavement leads to sorrow and death. True freedom is enjoyed only in the pathway to everlasting life. The universe cannot exist forever part slave and part free, as at present. The universal creation was never meant to be slave to selfishness and unrighteousness. The cause of freedom will win the eternity of peace. Freedom is the proper element in which Jehovah’s faithful creatures can live. Those who live and serve him forever must do so out of their own willing choice.

In like manner Almighty God has delivered over the modern Ammonites into the hand of his Greater Jephthah and the Theocratic organization under him. There is not the barest chance that Theocracy and worship of Jehovah will succumb to demon rule. To this late day the religious-totalitarian might has failed in the conspiracy to overthrow Jehovah’s witnesses.

He has given his disciples full warning in advance, that the time will come when they will kill, and they will believe they have done God a service by so doing. Jesus gave like warning to his followers in his prophecy concerning conditions at the end of the world; where we now are. (Matt. 24: 9) The worldly organization has gone over wholly to religion, which is demonism; and they will do anything within the demons’ imagination to hold their religion together, even to killing Jehovah’s witnesses. Why? Because they know not Jehovah God, the Father, nor his Son, Christ Jesus the King. It is the knowing of the Father and of his purpose, and of the issue involving Him, that is all-important.

The fruitage of Jesus’ course of action among the people proved the wisdom of his course. He had no home of his own; he had no kitchen, cook or other servants. Moreover, he declared: “The workman is worthy of his hire.” So he accepted such feasts as a partial recompense for the priceless Kingdom message that he gave to his entertainers. Thereby the contributors had a part in the support of his gospel work. Jesus’ acceptance of an invitation to the despised publican’s house showed he was not “choosy” of his territory as affected by the reputation of it according to religious circles.

In their global new order the workers of iniquity may flourish; they may finally close in on us to ‘eat up our flesh’, yet we may unwaveringly trust for ever in Jehovah.

To the apostles as “governors” was assigned the responsibility of making or creating ordinances for the good order, unity, edification and harmonious activity of Christian fellow believers, in agreement with the heavenly King.

Such suffering bears no resemblance to that of Jesus Christ, who was not in the employ of any earthly master, and it could not be compared by the apostle with what the Savior endured. The suffering to which all his followers are called must be the same in the case of a “household servant” subject to an earthly master as in the case of one that is devoting his entire time like Jesus to preaching God’s Word.

For example, the remnant by partaking of the Memorial emblems partake of what is on the Lord’s table, just as the priests of Israel of old were partakers of the animal victims upon the Lord’s altar.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord by his angels puts that servant out of his organization. The Lord Jesus at the temple so did from and after 1918. In the temple judgment he does not approve of their lawless, self-willed course nor commit to them “his goods”, but cuts that wicked servant class asunder from his visible organization. The Judge does not hesitate to appoint that “evil servant” his portion with the hypocrites, and bids that class to depart from him as “workers of iniquity”. He classes them with the religious hypocrites. They were foreshadowed by Judas and by his prototype, Ahithophel, King David’s traitorous counselor who at last hung himself, and they form part of the apostate “man of sin”, “the son of perdition.”—2 Sam. 17:1-23.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s servants have his commandments as to what to do continuously. His supreme commandments they will obey. They have sanctified him in their hearts by full consecration of themselves to him. Daily, in whatever land, under whatever human laws, they will be ready and prepared to explain their hope to humankind in its hopeless condition. No legislation or arrangements of man can alter that obligation upon God’s consecrated people. To declare “illegal” or to subject to purchase by license fees what He commands his devoted creatures to do is to fight against God; and to obey such human ordinances leads to destruction. When haled into courts because of ignoring such ordinances as not applying to them, they will not consider themselves as guilty of criminal disobedience. In court they will obey God’s command and be ready to give a defense of their hope on the witness stand. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The proposed human order beyond the total war can not be free; not with wicked spirits higher than men maneuvering all nations into opposition to Jehovah and his Son’s righteous Government. Satan and all his wicked angels well know that shortly they face a final showdown fight with the victorious organization of God and his King which hurled them out of the heavens. Therefore they are bent on organizing a lineup of all humankind against God. This will hardly allow, no, not at all allow for any real liberty. All men who are not free from Satan’s organization and who do not stand fast for freedom from it will be regimented onto the side of the enemy of Jehovah and of the New World of righteousness.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">All scripture, divinely inspired, is indeed profitable for teaching, for conviction.—2 Tim. 3:16, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In writing such counsel to the young man Timothy, Paul admonished him: “Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures.” Timothy’s father was a Greek, but his mother and her mother were Jewesses. This calls attention to the fact that Jewish parents and all men and women of faith taught their children from an early age on respecting the word of God. The custom was to teach the child the Bible at least at the age of five. Jehovah’s textbook of instruction is his recorded Word, the sacred Bible. It is The Great Book of Freedom. It is not a man’s book; not the mental outpourings of the thirty-six or more men who wrote the Bible. It was directly inspired by the Lord God.

<p><span class="font5">Indeed, since the Lord’s Messenger came to the temple in 1918, Jehovah God has done a wonderful thing in that he brought forth to revived activity in His public service the faithful remnant of his witnesses whom religionists imagined they had crushed for ever during World War I. The wonder of such enemies thereat was truly great. The delivered remnant did not attribute their salvation and restoration to men, whether politicians or judges, as liberators. They assigned it to Almighty God, who had thereby shown his approval and his choice of them as his “people for his name”, his witnesses. So they said: “0 Jehovah, my God art thou, I exalt thee, I confess thy name.” (Isa. 25: 1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Young)</span><span class="font5"> They were not ashamed to own Jehovah publicly before men as their God.

<p><span class="font5">We may be in the thick of the fight for Christian liberty, in a courtroom, before police magistrate, or in the presence of a gathering mob of demonized religionists. By then watching unto prayer and communing without uttered speech with our Helper on high, we can obtain the desired succor, as did King Jehoshaphat under assault by Syrians; and as did King Asa when facing a host of one million Ethiopians. (1 Ki. 22: 32, 33; 2 Chron. 14: 9-13) The Lord’s servants should watch for such emergencies and be alert and instant to exercise their privilege toward Him, to maintain His cause. The apostle shows, besides taking the defensive armor and the offensive “sword of the spirit”, what further is needed for successful fighting, saying: “praying always with all prayer.” We cannot carry on without calls for higher aid.

<p><span class="font5">The idea of applying themselves wholly to God’s service out of a mere love of righteousness and leaving the unlimited enjoyment of earthly good things till after Armageddon and its destruction of Satan’s unrighteous world, such an idea did not appeal to the “younger son” class. By their course of action toward the widely-proclaimed Kingdom message they in effect made request of the Life-giver Jehovah for their earthly portion now, to enjoy it to the full during this old world and to take whatever God’s mercy and grace might hold out to them under the Kingdom. They did not have the appreciation like the faithful men of old, who, without any heavenly hopes, served God fully and without withdrawal or compromise in this present life simply for righteousness’ sake, because it was right toward God.

<p><span class="font5">Because of faithfully carrying out their covenant of obedience and preserving their integrity, the Lord’s “other sheep” will be preserved through Armageddon and remain on earth forever in peace and prosperity. Down to the end of Armageddon they hold fast their integrity under the stress and persecution from the adversary, who strives to turn all humankind away from God. After beholding the majesty, power and glory of Jehovah manifested at Armageddon, and after having survived that greatest catastrophe of all time, they will keep on demonstrating their integrity under most blessed conditions, being faithful at all times after Armageddon even as they always were before it. Life is what these “other sheep” hope to gain, because life is what every creature of sober mind desires. Life without end under God’s Righteous Government and under the overlordship of the King Christ Jesus will be their grand blessing.

<p><span class="font5">Because of the oneness of mind and purpose and devotion to the Kingdom, and because of the keeping of integrity to God and showing exclusive interest in the vindication of His name, the world hates the disciples or “branches” of “The Vine”. Having taken a course contrary to that laid down by the world, they cannot escape being hated by the Devil’s organization. As long as a person is one with the world and supports its religion, politics and commerce, it will love him as one of its own. But when he sets his standard higher than that world’s selfish standard and puts God higher than the State, and goes out and works in the interest of God’s kingdom and its righteousness, and fights for the New World and its interests, then he is hated of the old world organization, even as Christ Jesus was hated of the world.

<p><span class="font5">The only begotten Son of God, being heavenly and spirit, was in the “form of God”; yet he did not follow Satan’s course and try to make himself equal with God and grasp the universal domination out of his Father’s hands. He joyfully submitted to the domination and will of the Supreme One. Arming ourselves with this mind of Christ will help us to overcome Satan and his world and their power to entice or frighten or coerce us into the sin of disloyalty and insubordination to God. Know this, that integrity and keeping covenant toward God to do his will faithfully to the end cannot be sustained without suffering, as long as this old world stands, and particularly now in the “time of the end”. The mind of Christ is one of unswerving determination to prove true and faithful to God while the Devil’s world lasts, let it cause what suffering God permits. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The true Christ prophetically warned of the appearance of men, particularly of organizations of men, who try to run ahead of the Son of God. These offer themselves as substitutes for Jesus, as if fully qualified and competent to fulfill the prophecies of the new world, and thus try to forestall the real work of Christ the King. Say they, God helps those who help themselves; and so they set aside Christ Jesus and his thousand-year reign as unnecessary. They claim that men, with the help of religion, are able to create with their own hands a world that will be suitable to human needs and enjoyment. Whose prophecies will you believe, theirs or those of Jehovah’s Word? Put faith in His unfailing Word and strive to obey and follow His word rather than man’s. This is your defense against world deception. Let no worldly coercion succeed in breaking youi’ faith. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine.—1 Pet. 4: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having been taken out from the Gentile nations through the redemptive sacrifice of God’s Son, it is altogether improper for God’s covenant-people longer to go in the way of the nations, according to the traditions of the nations of the doomed world. The test is on, of faith in God’s Word and of devotion and faithfulness to his kingdom and its righteousness. All professing Christians and persons of goodwill must now prove whether they are living for this world and working for that short-lived, deceptive postwar epoch, or are living for the righteous New World of endless success. The time past of the lives of Christians suffices for them to have wrought the will of the nations, going in the way of the worldly majority. Why spend more time thus to self-hurt?

<p><span class="font5">Regardless of the lack of discernment of some, and their slowness to comprehend, Jehovah God went forward with the preparing of the “feast of fat things” unto all peoples. He does not need first to consult or advise his consecrated servants or consider objections before he proceeds with carrying out his gracious purposes. He does according to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font5"> will. In 1935 the rejoicing and merry-making in behalf of the “prodigal son” class set in. From then on more was revealed from the Bible as to this earthly class than concerning any others who may gain everlasting life on earth. Such ones of the “elder son” class as were slow to get rid of old, incorrect ideas were obliged to inquire of the rejoicing servants of God, particularly the Watch Tower publications, as to why the rejoicing by the Father’s faithful remnant. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Greater Jephthah, Christ Jesus, has also accepted the challenge and gathered the advocates of Theocracy together. The opposition of the Epliraimite “evil servant” in trying to disrupt the Theocratic organization impels the faithful remnant and their companions to draw still closer together and also to bring in still more publishers for advertising God’s name and kingdom. They carry on no direct controversy or argumentation with the “evil servant” in any publication. In the spirit of the Lord and with the means He has provided they fight against the disruptive and destructive efforts of the “man of sin” company. The fight today for united service of Jehovah in worship of him is not waged with carnal weapons. It is fought with the instruments of the truth concerning The Theocratic Government and its rule. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Let household servants be subject with all fear to their masters.—1 Pet. 2:18, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such is not a fear to do the things of God, but a fear as to their business relationship. It is not a fear that would cause the servants to fail or refuse to preach the gospel outside of business hours or “off duty” or when even business circumstances allowed; nor would it terrify them into silence. Hence ‘being subject to masters with all fear’ means to recognize the position of the employer and what is his due therefore, and to fulfill all proper business requirements and regulations and render efficient service. So doing, the worker will not get the displeasure of his employer respecting work done. Such displeasure is what the servant should fear. He sees to it that the master to whom service is owed or sold does not suffer loss or damage due to failure or improper performance on his part.

<p><span class="font5">One in a covenant with God by consecration may no longer copy the world’s ways and drown himself in its immoralities, self-indulgences and pleasure-seeking, with indifference toward God’s kingdom. This would be wasting time, misusing his capacities to serve the Lord, consuming his energies injuriously to himself and others, and bringing him into unbreakable bondage to sin and the power of the demons. Hence it would interfere with performing his solemn consecration and would result in his failure to do God’s will and in unfaithfulness to Him. Such course brings great reproach upon God’s name. It supports the Devil’s challenge, and ends up in everlasting destruction of the covenant-breaker, at the latest at Armageddon. To the honor of God’s name and to your own everlasting benefit, shun even the beginnings of such a course and with heartfelt devotion abide faithful to God and his Righteous Rule. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

To him must go all the credit for the success, progress and prosperity of the witness work till now and of that which will climax his “strange work” in the near future. Were it not that He has “wrought all our works for us”, this visible organization and its work would have come to nought in that crucial year of 1940. But men cannot overthrow it, because in reality they are fighting against God in trying to do so. Almighty God has ordained peace, or prosperity and achievement of success, for his anointed remnant and “other sheep”. Such it is bound to be for those enduring to the end of the work.

<p><span class="font5">To the uninformed this might sound like the height of boldness and indecency on Jesus’ part, equal to inviting himself into a stranger’s home and to the meal which Zacchaeus provided for Jesus. Such was not the case, though. Jesus, in his regular house-to-house work, approached any door and announced his presence, without previous invitation. He then introduced himself or rather his mission and offered to come in and give Bible instruction. (Luke 10: 1-5) So Jesus was doing no more than telling Zacchaeus that he proposed to make a call at his house and offering to give him and his household a Kingdom witness, if he desired. If Zacchaeus did not want to let Jesus in to give his message, it was within his right to refuse to admit Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">From Moses’ time forward till Christ those whose prayers God recognized were faithful members of his chosen people of Israel. Thej were in relationship with Him by the covenant of the law through Moses. Thus they were persons in covenant bonds with God and who were endeavoring to be faithful to the covenant. Any who were aliens and strangers to the nation and outside its covenant must approach God through his organized people and in the manner of worship He had ordained in connection with his temple. Only thus could strangers find any favor from God and any answer to prayer. Such provision for the “stranger” should be of comfort to those who feel far off from Him and unacquainted with him, and who now are inclined to “seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him”.—Acts 17:27. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The trialsome “hour of temptation” is upon the world. Who can abide it blamelessly in God’s sight? (Rev. 3: 10) The issue of universal domination must now be decided as between Jehovah’s Theocracy by his King Christ Jesus and, on the opposition side, Satan’s organization, with its religion, politics and commerce. The temptation, therefore, is permitted in order to manifest the integrity of the faithful to Jehovah as Theocrat and Universal Ruler and to his Kingdom under Christ. The Lord’s supper was specially set up to aid the faithful to gain the victory amid the temptation; how? By keeping their hearts and minds turned toward Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus, and reminding them how he faithfully endured and perfectly met the Kingdom requirements.

The heaviness due to the trials should not crush the spirit of rejoicing; for the sure means of deliverance and salvation is at hand, Jehovah’s Theocracy. Far be it from anyone to now deceive himself. Satan may be expected to increase the fiery trial, like heating the furnace seven times as hot for the three Jehovah’s witnesses who refused to bow down to King Nebuchadnezzar’s gold image when the band played. But just as then, so now the Son of God has come to the temple and is with the approved “elect” ones and their companions in the fiery furnace.

<p><span class="font5">The ambassadors and representatives of the New World and its Government, although in this old world which has not fully passed away, are merely “strangers and pilgrims” among the Gentiles or worldly nations. Their allegiance is to The Theocracy, ‘the Holy City, New Jerusalem, which comes down from God out of heaven? Hence God’s remnant and no less their goodwill companions who put themselves under the same heavenly Government, are subject to Theocratic rule, wherever they may be on earth. Being “strangers and pilgrims” does not mean they are lawless and anarchistic toward the governments and laws of this world. Their God, Jehovah, is not the author of anarchism and disorderliness. Being strangers does mean that they are bound by a higher government and its law and must be primarily subject to Higher Powers. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was misjudged by men, misrepresented and made to suffer in the flesh, “he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.” (1 Pet. 2: 23) So Jehovah’s witnesses arm themselves with the like mind and care not that the judgment of the whole world is against them. They know that they “live according to God in the spirit”. In their need they “call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work”. (1 Pet. 1: 17) The spirit or holy power of God is working within them and accomplishing his will through them. God’s sons do his work by the power and help of his spirit.

Jehovah is the Creator, Compiler and Giver of the Bible. No man or group of men can truthfully and rightfully claim such relationship to that holy Book. If religious men or organizations were its creators, makers and compilers, it would not be an inspired and infallible book; but would be full of religious errors and traditions of men and demonism. Under the devilish efforts made during the centuries till now to destroy the Bible it would have perished long ago.

He works in a very wily manner. Sometimes to Christians propositions are presented that, on the surface, do not seem to be taking them away from their Kingdom allegiance and their privilege of serving it. Then, before they know it, their liberty is taken away. Thus, because one has not been vigilant and jealous for the Kingdom interests but has unsoberly let selfish desires and pleasures in this life lead him astray, such one may be devoured or swallowed up by Satan’s greedy organization.

Because of the steadfastness of His people, with the defeat of the terrible persecution thereby, there is no occasion for the intolerant crowd of religious-totalitarian tyrants to sing triumphantly. And when their collective-security “city of tyrannous nations” is built up like the city and tower of Babel after the total war, the songs of praise by its builders and admirers will within a “short time” be humbled and become low, as God Almighty’s battle of this great day threatens its destruction. It will never be a free, holy city. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The great campaign of free education of men of good-will is on! It specializes on what is essential to eternal life in the New World. Nothing can stop it until those thus educated graduate into the New World. Why not? Because the great Spirit is back of the campaign. All of good-will may partake of the only education that counts, freely. The only cost to them is the time and effort of studying the truths published by God’s visible organization engaged in the Elisha work. Blessed are those who hear the truth with hearing ears and who then discern that the real purpose of the truth is to lead them to consecrate themselves completely to Jehovah and his service. Such are blessed with a joyful share in the Kingdom educational campaign now before the final end comes on the world. This educational service will continue till then. It is bound to cause a complete division among the peoples, as when Elisha crossed Jordan. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

They will obey God’s command to go forth and carry the spiritual food to these starving sheep and show them the way of escape from religion and to the spiritual well-being and prosperity under his Theocratic organization. No time remains now to fight one another, to bite and devour one another in disunity; for that is a way to consume one another as Satan, the Dragon, would have us do. Voluntarily we must sink all things of selfish concern and unite in the common cause against the enemy, doing so for the advancement of the Kingdom interests against the aggressions of demon-controlled men.

<p><span class="font5">Since 1918 the Lord’s “other sheep”, the “strangers” of good-will, hear the world-wide invitation to assemble and give allegiance to the New Jerusalem, The Theocracy. They respond to the invitation in multitude. The remnant under Christ Jesus have taken the lead on the highway cast up toward the Kingdom, and the “other sheep” hear the Good Shepherd’s inviting voice and then join the remnant on the way of holiness, following with them as “companions” in service and in reproaches and suffering. Hence the companions, a great multitude of them, appear in the apostle John’s vision, and he writes of them: “Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.”—Rev. 7: 15.

To Jesus must we look, just as the faithful witnesses of old looked forward to him according to God’s promise and believed in his coming. Jesus is the beginner or author of such faith as we may now have in Jehovah, and he is the One in whom faith finds its finished or perfect example. He is, therefore, the Finisher or Perfecter of our faith in God. (John 1: 18) If those witnesses of old demonstrated such faith and triumphed by it so long in advance of the coming of the King, then more reason have we to triumph by faith.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 24. 48, 49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">drunken</span><span class="font5"> are those of this world who are in the darkness of its night, careless and indifferent toward the Lord’s coming. Accordingly they fill themselves full with the selfish things of this world, not caring about feeding and watering the Lord’s “other sheep”. The “evil servant” class neither keep up with the “meat in due season” which the Lord provides nor do they seek to pass it on to others, their brethren and the Lord’s “other sheep”. They view themselves as the spiritual class, beside whom the others must wait as to God’s favors and spiritual food. So they “feed themselves”, ‘eating and drinking’ for selfish desires after the manner of the “drunken” world. Shortly after the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918 such a class began to manifest themselves and to pursue such a course toward their brethren.

<p><span class="font5">Do you desire to obey him and to overcome as He did ? Then mark that Jesus, while in the world as a man, resisted becoming a part of the world. He resisted all compromise with religion, which would mean departing from God’s law and commandments. He refused to give up preaching God’s coming kingdom for the pursuit of commercial material things of this world or the headship and bossism of the worldly political machine. Such resistance even unto blood against the worldly elements resulted in Jesus’ personal triumph over the world. His resurrection from the dead was a triumph of the omnipotent power of Jehovah God over the power of death. Both triumphs were to God’s vindication. In both cases the Devil was defeated and proved to be a liar, deceiver and blasphemer, and inferior to the Supreme and Almighty One, Jehovah God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That great Shepherd and Overseer is Jehovah. To him the Good Shepherd Christ Jesus brings back the sheep of the “little flock” and also now the “other sheep”. All these “sheep” may no longer live unto sin, which sin is to be friends of this world and to take part in its course of opposition to God and his Kingdom. They must live unto the righteousness of the New World under God’s kingdom, that they may hold fast their integrity in the love of righteousness and prove the Devil a liar. To do works of righteousness according to Jesus’ example means to “keep the commandments of God” to be His witness and thus to share in “the testimony of Jesus Christ”. So doing, the “sheep” will suffer as he did, and for like reasons; and the enduring of such suffering is acceptable with God as being in vindication of his name.—Matt. 5: 10-12.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus kept his Father’s commandments by fulfilling the terms of his commission to Jehovah to be His witness, preaching the Kingdom gospel to the meek and comforting all that mourn, and fulfilling all the things written in the law and prophett, concerning his course on earth. Thus he kept in God’s love. By a like course must his commissioned disciples abide in his love. By holding forth the Kingdom gospel, and doing so with the joy of the Lord and with integrity toward Him and his Righteous Government, the “branch” offers life-sustaining food to others that they may be enlightened, helped and strengthened to choose the Lord God and serve him and his Kingdom. By this activity of the vine-branch the Father is glorified, and in no other way. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

He is the Almighty God and the Creator. All nations under demon rule are but as a drop in the bucket or the fine dust on the scale pan in comparison with Jehovah, who will puff the opposing nations away at Armageddon. He will be a terror to them and will trouble them before destroying them. With invincible power he will protect and preserve all who fear him with godly fear, being anxious to please him by obeying him rather than men. It is His truth that sanctifies. The truth concerning Jehovah enables us to sanctify him in our hearts and put out of our hearts religion, which is a friend of this world and a part of it.

This instruction does not mean that Jehovah’s witnesses must not go from house to house with the message. It means they should not change from one place of physical entertainment to another in any city or town where they are working and persons of goodwill receive and entertain them freely. They owe some spiritual ministration of the Kingdom message for such bodily refreshment and care. Their most direct and certain way of inquiring in a city who in it was worthy would be to go from house to house presenting the Kingdom gospel, thereby identifying themselves and thus letting persons show worthiness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Let no one deceive himself: sin is sin, whether due to inborn tendencies and weakness or due to willful choice. One cannot indulge willingly in any form of sin. One dare not delude himself into thinking he may safely indulge in the “common sins of the flesh”, so called, and do so willingly for the self-pleasure thereof, and yet avoid committing the unforgivable sin of covenant-breaking and disloyalty to God and his kingdom. That delusion is a trick of Satan. It leads to disaster. Conscious and deliberate unfaithfulness in small or petty things of sin develops, if unchecked, into gross sin of covenant-unfaithfulness and hypocritical renunciation of God. If you have determined to suffer rather than sin, and have therefore “ceased from sin”, then there is no occasion or room to practice sin of any sort with consent and in self-indulgence.

(John 18: 37) The King now bears the title “The Faithful and True Witness”, and all of his free nation hear his voice of testimony and are of the truth.

Every consecrated Kingdom publisher today should make the same effort. Never allow your daily occupations to encroach so far upon your time as to keep you out of God’s active service entirely. Some time every week should be devoted to Christian activity. It behooves us, then, to be sober and vigilant, lest the Devil, by his organization, subdue us by his propaganda roarings and devour us.

His father’s house, in company with his elder brother, was not the place for what adventure and for what a fling at life and abandon he wanted. The covenant-keeping life of his brother was too narrow and strait and confined, too regulated and orderly for him.

Whether they live eternally or die depends upon their own choice of conduct. Those who choose everlasting life must give heed to the Highest Educator and learn and apply the instruction from him. The fact is, all true instruction to fit one for endless life in happiness, peace and liberty proceeds from Jehovah God. To his sons on earth he says: “My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: for length of days, and years of life, and peace, shall they add to thee.” It is free education that Jehovah provides for those who learn of him.

By God’s strength and spirit working through them they do so to the successful finish of the work. Thus it will be proved that this work is not of man, but of God and done by his power, and hence could not fail or come to nought. The purpose of the activities of these ministers of the divine “oracles” is not selfish or for commercial gain, but that God may be glorified. Knowing that to God must “be praise and dominion for ever and ever”, they abide immovably by and under the universal domination of Jehovah God and are diligent to glorify his name and kingdom.

That fact, however, does not mean they laid aside God’s written Word as unnecessary and considered themselves as more important than the Bible. They did not require the people to accept their preaching without consideration of the Bible. To the direct contrary! By abiding unshakably upon the written Bible Jesus overcame the tempter. He proved himself worthy to be the Vindicator, not only of Jehovah’s name, but also of His written Word, inasmuch as His name is inseparably attached to that Word. Continually thereafter, throughout all his preaching, Jesus referred to God’s written Word and quoted from it.

Such gospel of God’s kingdom as bom in 1914 has been preached with unparalleled publicity in all the world to all nations since 1918, so much so that all nations and all religious organizations have risen up in opposition to the Kingdom witness.

When establishing the Lord’s supper with his disciples our Master, who left us an example that we should follow his steps, voiced thanks and blessing upon the bread and wine. Before performing the miracles of feeding the five thousand and then the four thousand in the wilderness he gave thanks and asked the divine blessing on the meager, inadequate food supplies with which he began but which he then broke and multiplied. After his resurrection from the dead he did not change his procedure. When he appeared to tw’o disciples on the road to Emmaus and went in to tarry with them, “as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

Such testquestions are to make them show whether they speak the “pure language”, free from all religion, and in line with God’s judgments against religion, but in support of The Theocracy and its vindication of God’s name.

However, when an “ordinance” or “creation” pertains to the King as pre-eminent or excelling, then every such ordinance should be submitted to by obedient Christians. Therefore, when any “ordinance” or organization instruction is set forth by the responsible men in the visible part of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization today, and such ordinance is in obedience to the King’s command at Matthew 24: 14 concerning the preaching of “this gospel of the kingdom”, then Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions should be subject to such “ordinance of man”, and should do so on account of the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the first one to receive the permanent reward for his sufferings for doing well on earth. He was “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners”. For no sins of his own did he suffer, neither did he die for such. It was because of sins committed against him and his Father Jehovah God that he died after keen suffering. That was what directly produced his sufferings and death. The test was that, while suffering, he must retain his integrity toward God. He must not sin under the sufferings by abandoning Jehovah God in bitterness or by yielding to fear and selfishness and compromising with his persecutors just to get relief. He must endure the suffering uncomplainingly, proving himself faithful to Jehovah God and the kingdom which he came into the world to preach, even unto martyrdom. This he did.

<p><span class="font5">Lust for power or directive authority, or for lording it over God’s heritage-people, leads one to serve for filthy lucre, which is selfish gain. Consequently one who obeys the above words could never be a pope or hierarchical prince of a religious organization. Jehovah’s true servant serves unselfishly, because any appointed service is a great privilege given to Kingdom publishers manifesting greater ability and fitness than others. Doing so “readily” means being willing to respond instantly to larger service opportunities and willing to put into the performance of Theocratic organization instructions everything one has. One so doing is ready in season and out of season to serve his fellow publishers and to care for all Kingdom interests. He keeps on the alert, is on time, and keeps things in order.

<p><span class="font5">That God caused so much to be written in the Bible respecting the “other sheep” and causes such to be fulfilled now before Armageddon, rather than after, is no sign of favoritism to the “prodigal” nor of neglect to those who have hitherto served Him many years. The feast is there for the spirit-begotten ones to enjoy as well, and thereby get out of any self-centeredness or exclusive self-interest. They are not the only ones God loves or upon whom he may show mercy; nor the only ones that may have part in his service and in vindication of His name. It is the Father’s feast, and it is the privilege of the “elder son” to enjoy it as part of his reward for years of faithful service. That blessings are beginning to go to the “other sheep” is a cause for joy, joy as an unselfish expression of mercy and compassion. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Demonstrate your faith by boldly acting as a witness and holding forth to all the “word of life”. The knowledge of God’s Word is the basis of all faith, and the people in the darkness of religion and unbelief must be enabled to hear' that Word of Jehovah God that they may develop faith that leads them to The Only Light and life. “So then faith eometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Rom. 10: 17) By building up others with the Word of God we increase our own appreciation thereof and build up ourselves and them as well in the faith with which alone we can please God. This, then, slack not to do; for God’s Word exhorts us: “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the holy [spirit], keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.”—Jude 20, 21; Prov. 11: 25.

Jehovah’s witnesses will pray for the non-political government to whose support and service they have assembled, namely, the New Jerusalem, The Theocracy. For its prosperity, for the advancement of its interests on earth, and for the early victory in vindication of God’s name, they pray. The above exhortation to pray for Jehovah, “the King of Eternity,” to rule successfully and prosperously by his Anointed King, Christ Jesus, is in harmony with a like exhortation, at 1 Timothy 2:1, 2: “I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men [who will gain life in the new world which God so loves]; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span></p>

Therefore those who are bom in her keep her regulations, because these are from God, who is the Head of Zion and of her King Christ Jesus. The faithful remnant have always desired to walk in the way of His regulations. It is a matter of eternal life that they do so now, because it is the day of judgment since the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918. Jehovah is the Most Upright One.

He suffered for God’s kingdom and its righteousness. Will we avoid suffering for righteousness’ sake? Will the pressure of persecution on the part of an earthly master turn us aside ? Are we serving God for selfish gain rather than love of righteousness? Will we as servants of God abandon Jehovah’s cause because of unwarranted opposition, that is, opposition because we serve Him? To these questions the answer must be a decisive No, if we would faithfully follow our heavenly Master; “because Christ also suffered for us [for our guidance, and not for wrongdoing or sins], leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

Ever forward he pressed to new and untouched fields to give the Kingdom witness. He held on to the ministry by faithful activity till his tongue was stilled in death. His tenacity in the ministry shows that the ministry of preaching the Kingdom gospel is the greatest privilege of service on earth. It is the only work for which the true Christian lives on earth. It is the only life’s occupation with which he should finish his earthly career and for which he should suffer and lay down his life in martyrdom. Not all can be apostles as was Paul, but all consecrated Christians can be ministers of the gospel like him when he tramped about proclaiming the glad tidings by word of mouth, “from house to house.”—Acts 20: 20.

<p><span class="font5">There is no other way whereby men can be saved to life eternal than by knowing Jehovah the Fountain of life and recognizing Christ Jesus as the Sent One of the Father. Jesus at all times directed the seekers of life to the Father, and by his sacrifice he provided the means for reconciliation of man with God. Hence he was true to the facts when he said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.” (John 14: 6, 7) Those who know Christ Jesus in his full and true relationship to the divine purpose must, of necessity, then, know the Father in heaven. To ignore the Father would be exalting the creature above the Creator. It is worshiping the channel of salvation rather than the Source.

<p><span class="font5">The Christian’s hope is in Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. Before anyone will ask the reason or explanatory account for such hope, that Christian must first have been active in fulfillment of his anointing or commission to preach the gospel of the Kingdom. His activity in field service; his obedience to God rather than men when there Is a clash between the laws of God and those of “Caesar”; his refusal to conform himself to this world and its political, commercial, religious schemes; this is what provokes the demand in court or the request in private homes or prison for an account of one’s faith and one’s relationship with God, inducing one to such conduct.

They cannot consent with religious thieves and with politicians, judges and officers of the law who unrighteously and profanely encroach upon the God-given right and freedom to worship Jehovah and to preach his gospel. The eternal interests of the people must be safeguarded. Silence against thievery would bring condemnation from God, as follows: “When thou sawest a thief, then thou eonsentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.” (Ps. 50: 16-18) Such a course would bring the loss of being a witness for Jehovah and a publisher of his kingdom.

He had no Bible with him, neither any printed literature explaining the Bible to leave with those at the house to read and study after he quickly passed on to the next house. It was necessary for Jesus to spend time at the home and deliver first his extensive testimony respecting the Kingdom and then answer questions upon the Bible and over the questioner’s course of action to follow. As a laborer at the work of the gospel, he was not out of order in accepting a meal if it was convenient to his own time and if the gratitude of his hearers moved them to offer such. He improved the mealtime to preach the glad tidings and serve spiritual food to the diners. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Paul quotes this and makes it apply after he discusses the resurrection of the members of the body of Christ, the church. (1 Cor. 15: 54) It is on the day of Jehovah, after his royal Messenger comes to the temple for judgment in 1918, that God gives the faithful saints sleeping in death this victory by resurrecting them from the dead. In their case, indeed, is death swallowed up in victory! Now that the Kingdom is here and the King is at the temple, the remnant yet on earth do not at death go to sleep in the grave. The “last trump” announcing the Kingdom’s establishment and Armageddon’s approach is sounding; and blessed are those who now die of the remnant, for they do not sleep behind the “gates of hell” to await the King’s coming to call them forth. At death in the flesh, they are “changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye”, to life in the spirit. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The water-smiting by the Elisha class under Christ Jesus has resulted in the ‘parting of the waters’; and as the smiting with the Kingdom message continues, the dividing of the people will widen, until the separation is complete. Today the “mantle” of Theocratic truth, wrapped together in unity, becomes stronger and stronger, and the smiting power of it becomes more effective. It is our obligation to continue smiting therewith, crying out as we do so: “Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?” The “waters” have already parted marvelously; they shall continue to part until the truth has separated and made free from Satan’s organization all the “meek of the earth”.

He puts into practice the Theocratic rule and procedure within that organization, establishing over it a unified command and ruling it from the top down. The “evil servant” class would adhere to such organization, unified command and Theocratic governance and submit to it if they in their hearts believed in the Lord’s having come and being present. They would agree that such joyful, willing submission is due from them as befitting the time and occasion of his presence. But their selfish-hearted action and desire to ‘do every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes’ prove they do not believe the Theocratic King has come.

<p><span class="font5">There is only one Chief Shepherd, and all are accountable to him. It is therefore out of order for any to seek to be lords over the floek. Christ Jesus is the Chief Shepherd of the “little floek” of those to be joint heirs with him in the throne in the heavenly rule. He is the King of the new world of righteousness and of all those on earth who will fear God, honor the King, be subject to him and obey organization instructions. The Lord’s “other sheep” now being gathered will make up the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors. They come to Christ by hearing the message. They accept him as Savior and King and make a covenant or solemn agreement to serve God. This covenant they symbolize by baptism in water. It is a covenant of obedience to do God’s will.

They must keep their affections fixed upon that Righteous World, and not go in the way of men of this world who are materialistic, fleshly, governed by the passions of the fallen flesh. They must not lust after or set desire and affection upon the commerce, politics and religion of this world and take part therein. To do so would mean unfaithfulness to the interests of the New World and mixing in with and becoming friends of the Godless old world.

Under all the pressure of the enemy they sustain their one purpose, without even the thought of its abandonment. In this purpose and determination God Almighty also sustains, upholds and stays them up, because it is in harmony with his own will and purpose. He guards them therein. He blesses their faithful keeping to their purpose with progress, granting them victories over the enemies and also success in ‘fishing’ and ‘hunting’ for the scattered and strayed “other sheep” of the Lord.

Regardless of the actual location or the distance of the country, it was far from the spirit of the younger son’s father. The son “there squandered his substance with riotous living”, not saving anything against the unpredictable future. To get as much selfish pleasure out of this life, at whatever cost, was his aim. He did not work, and thus was a double waster. “He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.” Satan is the greatest waster or destroyer. Jesus said that he that is not for Him is against him and he that does not gather with him seattereth. One not for Him shows a relationship to the great waster and seatterer.

When their works are in obedience to the law of God rather than to the law of “Caesar”, God judges them as faithful and approved, regardless of the punishment which “Caesar” heaps upon them. These faithful ones are ambassadors of the Righteous Government of the New World. They view the Kingdom and its service as of paramount importance. They put first things first, and thus the Kingdom interests have the first place in their lives. Their hopes are not set upon this old world and its survival beyond this total war. They “love not the world, neither the things that are in the world”.

Satan could kill only the body of Jesus. The right to life eternal, which right was maintained by Jesus’ keeping his integrity faultless, Satan’s power of death could not destroy. Then for Jesus’ superb part in vindicating his Father’s name by suffering faithfully to death God rewarded him most highly.

<p><span class="font5">The Christian employee sees to it that he does not suffer because of shortcomings, indifference, carelessness or neglect at his assigned duties. No merit attaches to patiently enduring buffeting or being cuffed for such faults or sins. What, however, if the servant is faithful at his job and his “master” mistreats him and discriminates against him only because his employee faithfully serves as a witness for Jehovah? Then when the servant endures such sufferings without bitterness, malice or retaliation, he is suffering wrongfully and it is “for conscience toward God” and for well-doing in His service. The enduring of such “grief”, wrongfully administered, is for the vindication of God’s name. To quote 1 Peter 2:20: “If, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Let the younger persons be subject to the seniors; and all of you submit to each other, and be clothed with humility.—1 Pet. 5:5, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Young folks are so prone to get entangled with the things of this world. So the admonition is timely that the young persons be subject to those who are more mature in the teaching, instructions and service of the Lord. Let them seek instruction of the senior members of the organization. All younger persons, not necessarily younger in years, but in knowledge of the truth, do well to “be subject” to the elder ones and to submit themselves in the interests of good order and to be clothed with humility. Due to worldly education certain ones are able to express themselves better than others. Although they can do this, they should no less be clothed with humility, not being disdainful of others, but meek, kind, considerate of weaker brethren and anxious to help them.

<p><span class="font5">Likewise the Lord’s “other sheep” must overcome the unbelief of “organized religion” and must show faith toward Jehovah and his Word by works of co-operation with the remnant of His witnesses. They must fear God rather than the rulers of this world and their officers who seek to destroy Jehovah’s servants. They must believe his Word concerning the day of his vengeance and must warn others and aid in the gathering of them into the designated place of security and preservation under Jehovah’s Theocratic organization. Only by so doing will they be of that earthly class whom Almighty God’s power safeguards through Armageddon and who thereafter have the privilege of bringing forth righteous offspring in fulfillment of the divine mandate in the New World.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christ Jesus hath made me free.—Rom. 8:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those Jews who came to him in faith and became his disciples and continued in his word of truth were made free. They became free even from the law of Moses, which required of them perfection of righteousness. Such requirement they could not meet, and therefore the law showed them always their bondage to sin, imperfection and death. In due time Gentiles received the truth of Christ Jesus and accepted and believed in him as the Seed of Abraham in whom all families of the earth should be blessed. These were likewise liberated from sin and its condemnation, and from bondage to the Devil, and from religion, which is demonism. Christ Jesus did not bring such Gentiles into subjection to Moses’ law from Mount Sinai, for even the Jewish believers Jesus relieved of obligation to that law covenant of Sinai. To all believers, whether Jew or Gentile, Jesus opened the way to come to Jehovah God the Father. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We are all “strangers and pilgrims” to this present evil world and are en route to the righteous New World. God’s remnant, being approved, anointed and taken into the Kingdom covenant, are made a part of his Theocratic organization. Their “citizenship is in heaven”, the “new heavens”, “new Jerusalem.” Their earthly companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, consecrate themselves to Jehovah through faith in Christ Jesus and take refuge under His Theocratic organization. Thereby they come under the protection of The Theocracy, the New Jerusalem. Both remnant and companions appreciate the privilege of having their feet stand on the solid Rock, the Foundation of the New World. They are determined to let nothing sweep them off their feet away from the Theocratic Government of the New Jerusalem.—Rev. 21:2. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 135:13, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At no time did Jesus direct attention to himself apart from his place in Jehovah’s purpose. Throughout his entire teaching he directed his learners to the One whose name should be memorialized throughout eternity. That One is Jehovah, his Father in heaven, who had sent him into the earth for a purpose. That purpose he accomplished faithfully. There is no way under heaven whereby men can be saved other than by following the footsteps of Christ Jesus. This means loving the Lord God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself. It was his Father’s name that must be memorialized before men therefore, and it is through the arrangements made by the Father that men can be saved by Christ Jesus.—John 17:3.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In meekness instructing those that oppose.-2 Tim. 2:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not in fanaticism, not in the self-conceited spirit of “I am right and you are wrong”, not in a threatening and coercive way, but in the meekness of Christ Jesus and in fear of God, his followers go to the people. They are commissioned to “comfort all that mourn”, and to sound the Lord’s warning to “seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger”. They do not rail at the “goats” or willful opposers, but refrain their tongue from evil and their lips that they speak no guile. They seek no quarrel or fight with the goats, but “eschew evil, and do good”, and “seek peace, and ensue it”. They are not disturbers of the peace and good order of any community. They waste no time or words on the “goats”, but turn from them to the search and hunt for the “sheep”, those who “will love life, and see good days”.—1 Pet. 3:10,11.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The disciples also were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.—Acts 11:26, Young; Companion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This calling them Christians was not accidental. It was directed of the Lord God. For that strong reason Satan the mimic was quick and jealous to seize the name and pervert it by applying it to religion, that brand which is a counterfeit of Christianity. He did so when he found he could not wipe out Christianity violently by means of his pagan “king of the north”, with headquarters at Rome. Religionists, mistakenly and fraudulently professing to be “Christian”, do not glorify God Jehovah in this name or for this name. (1 Pet. 4:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Instead, the religionists, including the nations calling themselves “Christian nations”, persecute those called by God’s name and even decree that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s</span><span class="font5"> witnesses are an “illegal organization”.

<p><span class="font5">This unfaithful group speak evil of their fellow servants by hurling false, malicious charges against their brethren who are discharging their duties as unto the Lord. Thereby they ‘smite their fellow servants’, and cause suspicions, evil surmising, disturbance, disruption and divisions within the organization. They proceed lawlessly as respects the Theocratic law, and do not follow the Lord’s rule stated at 1 Corinthians 6:1, 2: “Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints ? Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">To this purpose were glad tidings announced also to the dead, so that indeed they might be judged, in flesh, according to men, but, in spirit, according to God.—1 Pet. 4:6, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such men are in power now and have the means of executing earthly judgment. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Judging</span><span class="font5"> means not merely rendering an opinion or handing down a ruling, but also executing the judgment rendered against the one adversely judged. (Acts 7:7) Satan the Devil uses men as his dupes and tools. He sees to it that they judge Jehovah’s witnesses according to the external appearance. So, then, they frame these servants of God. Then, under guise of worldly law and order, Satan can use officers of the law and those who take the law into their own hands to punish Jehovah’s people unjustly. This Satan brings about in order to turn them out of the path of life and integrity toward God and to stop their work of preaching the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard.—Heb. 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus was anointed with God’s spirit to be the King of the Government of the New World, and all his petitions to his Father were in behalf of that world to come. He was uncompromising toward God’s adversary. He proved that Jehovah’s chief Son and highest officer in His universe was unbreakably loyal, faithful and true to Him. To keep his grip on his integrity, Jesus drew on the divine strength by supplication to God. This enabled him to vindicate his Father’s name and word by unswerving obedience and a correctness of course on earth. So he proved worthy to exercise the powers of the New World government and vindicate Jehovah’s name at Armageddon. For related reasons, namely, to keep integrity and share with Jesus in vindicating God’s name, his faithful followers need likewise to resort to prayer. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thy kingdom come.—Luke 11:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Inasmuch as the Kingdom was established in 1914, why still pray that? True, the heavenly King is here, ruling upon the throne in the midst of all his enemies, who have been made his footstool at the earth. Nonetheless, the prayer is still proper to render to God. The opposition governments on earth under Satan still operate. The “iron rod” of the King must still come against them at Armageddon. The “stone” of God’s kingdom by his Messiah Prince has indeed been cut without human hands out of the “mountain” of God’s universal organization. The “stone” exists as “cut out” in 1914, but it must yet smite the terrible image of Satan’s organization and grind it to powder. Thus the kingdom of God must yet come. It will speedily come at Armageddon and will thereafter become the “great mountain” that fills the whole earth without any place left for any postwar government.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Be careful to maintain good works.—Titus 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not “fifth columnists” in any land. Their behavior is “honest”, which means “seemly”, “upright,” sincere and conscientious, open and aboveboard. Hence openly they refuse to do obeisance to creatures and things in violation of God’s commandment forbidding such. This is not done to influence others who are not strangers and pilgrims but citizens of the old world. It is done to show allegiance to their God and their heavenly King and to maintain their integrity toward such “Higher Powers”. While this world and its nations are about to pass away they obey God’s commandment by his King and do the “good works” of preaching the Kingdom gospel and comforting all that mourn due to religion’s failure and ungodliness. That is what they are commissioned by God’s spirit to do. Such good works glorify Jehovah God and show forth his praises. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The elders, or local servants, in a congregation must bear in mind that to do this is their principal work. They must see to it that the flock are properly nourished with God’s Word, cared for and protected. Doubtless the vast majority of the persons of goodwill are yet like “lost sheep”, like sheep scattered about because of the mix-up of the many religions and because of the predatory methods of the politicians and commercial traffickers who are the principal ones in the religious organizations. Hence it is necessary for Christians who desire to feed those who will become the Lord’s “other sheep” to sally forth like a shepherd on the hunt for his lost sheep. They must brave the enemies and other dangers and seek out the true sheep from house to house, feed them, and show them the right way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach.—Isa. 61:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These prophetic words set out the terms of Jesus’ commission from his Principal and Head, Jehovah God. It was this commission that Christ Jesus was sent to earth to fulfill as Jehovah’s Senior Ambassador. He did not receive his commission from the Jewish clergy or their theological school at Jerusalem, but from God. Christ Jesus displayed no framed graduate’s diploma from the religious schools of his day. He called public attention to being anointed or commissioned from Jehovah God. This was by virtue of wholly consecrating himself to God, such consecration being symbolized by water baptism. His anointing with God’s spirit definitely carried with it the authority and commission to preach the good news. Not alone did Jesus confess his commission to preach, but he carried it out with perfect integrity. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, . . . and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.—Mal. 3: 1,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not that the written Word of God is like impure silver, but that those seeking to understand it had unwittingly commingled so many impurities of religion with their beliefs. Therefore those fully consecrated to God needed purification from all soils and taints of religion. Such defiling had attached to them from the great religious confusion that set in shortly after the apostles died. At Christ’s coming to the temple in 1918 he gathered before him all professing Christians, because “judgment must begin at the house of God”. He foretold that he would judge them by his word, which is the Word of God. This Christ Jesus does by acting as Interpreter of God’s Word and making clear the meaning and message of the Bible, to magnify Jehovah’s name and purpose and His Theocratic Government or Kingdom.—Isa. 42:19-21.

The company of prophets which Saul met in the days of Judge Samuel is understood to have been one of such schools, presided over by Samuel. About two centuries later Elijah and Elisha were active for the education of the people. Queen Jezebel tried to destroy the prophets associated with them and thus suppress this educational movement for Jehovah’s worship, and many of them she did kill. The account of the times mentions “sons of the prophets” in connection with Elijah and Elisha. Although no such expression as “school of the prophets” occurs, yet these “sons of the prophets” were evidently in a school or college to fit them for their public work of education.

<p><span class="font5">A few hours later, when Jesus was hanging on the tree, he uttered the words, “It is finished.” “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” He had finally proved himself ‘more than conqueror’, and knew he could confidently commend to his Creator’s hands the preservation of his right to everlasting life and his “spirit” or power of life. He refused to break his covenant with God requiring faithfulness for the Kingdom, or let go his absolute blamelessness or integrity under such stiff tests of obedience and devotion to God. He knew that the divine prophecies foretold a disgraceful, lingering death as in store for him, and he resolved to march right into that death, faultless before the One who had sent him to demonstrate before men and angels the perfect, unbreakable devotion to God, though assaulted by Satan and his world.

<p><span class="font5">The prodigal did not ask to be received and put to work as a son, but offered himself for work as a hired servant. His confession with repentance pictures that the “prodigal” class confess their sins, ask forgiveness through Christ’s meritorious sacrifice and consecrate themselves fully to Jehovah the Father. Their act of consecration was also foreshadowed in the plea of the famine-stricken people of ancient Egypt during Joseph’s premiership: “Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die.” Consecration by the “prodigal” class is not a contract with God for a share in the heavenly inheritance of the spiritual sons of God, but is a solemn agreement to do God’s will for ever, letting him determine where He will have the consecrated one serve him.

We are at the end of the world of wickedness, and at the portals of the New World. The unity prayed for by the King must exist in fulfillment of the prayer, both as to the faithful remnant and then as to the “other sheep” their companions. The old world is divided by total war between “the king of the north” and “the king of the south”; but Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are one, on all continents, whether scattered by the enemy in jails and concentration camps or still free to go about publicly and from house to house preaching the Kingdom gospel.

It is that we may not by an unseemly outward appearance reflect upon the lives of the message-bearers. In our hearts we have something which outward adorning can never put in or on creatures of the world, namely, “the hidden man of the heart.” Our heart or affection which moves us into action is set on the Kingdom. What we are and live for is Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ. We do not keep this consecrated self of Kingdom devotion hidden away in our heart, with benefit to no one outside.

They should be pure in their relationships to one another, exhorting one another to be diligent, tireless, constantly and fully occupied in the Lord’s service. They should keep their hearts and attention fixed on the New World and the glorious privileges of life that its Righteous Government will open up to all that keep their integrity toward the Most High God. Every aid to that end they should avail themselves of now in this “evil day”. Go forth in the Lord’s name and armed with the mind of Christ, wielding the “sword of the spirit”, God’s Word.

Religion, which dispenses with Jehovah God and heaps reproach upon his name, does not and can not possess faith, because rejecting the rock-bottom Foundation of correct faith. Remove Jehovah from your belief, hope and confidence and it is as if removing the sun-center from our planetary system and still expecting the light of day to flood our earth. Faith cannot exist without Him, the Creator of the living universe, the great Source of everlasting life, eternal truth and genuine goodness.

This is manifest from their obedience to him and his example and by their world-wide unity with him in their Father Jehovah’s work. All such are Israelites after the spirit, “the Israel of God.” Hence they were foreshadowed by the faithful of the twelve tribes of Israel that came up to the temple and whom the psalmist calls “the tribes of Jehovah”. Though Christ Jesus and his resurrected body members are in the invisible heavenly realm and the faithful remnant are still in the flesh on earth as witnesses, yet they are all in unity at the temple, and Christ Jesus is the invisible Leader and Commander of the temple work according to Jehovah’s will and purpose.

As such he would be Jehovah’s witness. The instruction course he offered could not be obtained in the thousands of Jewish schools of the day all subject to religionists. He taught concerning the new world and the Theocratic Government thereof. The theme of his instruction was, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand; repent ye, and believe the gospel.” Though it was nineteen centuries before the Kingdom’s establishment in power in 1914, yet the instruction concerning it was education of supreme importance to men and most honoring to God. Christ Jesus offered free education to humankind. Never did he pass around the collection plate to put learners under embarrassing constraint.

To maintain our standing in Christ we must keep up the fight for freedom; we must continue to obey the truth and to proclaim it to others, that the Lord’s “other sheep” may gain the liberation which it brings. In view of the certainty of further and increasing aggressions of the enemy who envy and begrudge Jehovah’s people their liberty in Christ, the best resistance is to steadily press the offensive against the forces of demonism, which is religion. Christ Jesus, our Leader, is not on the defensive, but on the march to victory. The armies which are in heaven follow him, and his remnant on earth do likewise, whithersoever he leads.

During this “day of his preparation” God’s appointed work must be done by his anointed, spirit-begotten witnesses, his remnant. (Matt. 24:14) By granting this merciful interval, during which the “younger son” class are permitted to take first their selfish course till coming to their senses, Jehovah God divided to the remnant class the privilege of serving Him in the field by publishing this gospel of the Kingdom. And to the “younger son” class He divided a period of time for the use of their earthly privileges according to their will, to expend their human lives selfishly before Armageddon broke, if they chose.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing.—1 Pet. 3:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s people forgive one another rather than take personal offense. They are humble-minded, having this same mind which was also in Christ Jesus, and do not seek to exalt themselves one above the other in order to shine and wield authority above others. They are courteous, and hence considerate, treating one another with due regard as being servants of Jehovah God. They show this same courteousness when they go from house to house bearing witness to the people concerning God’s kingdom. Thereby they do not permit selfish matters to cause dissensions among them and to take their minds off God’s kingdom and its service. At wrongful treatment from the world they do not permit Satan to enter their hearts and to induce them to return evil for evil. Their desire is not for revenge, in bitterness. Vengeance belongs to God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Satan exercised his power of death against the Son of God only in the last effort to make him break his integrity and violate his covenant relationship with God. The faithful death of Jesus was the perfect answer to Satan’s challenge to God and was a triumph over Satan. It was a forerunner of the final victory over Satan when the Son of God, whose violent death Satan accomplished, will himself execute God’s judgment of death upon the adversary. “That through death he might bring to nought him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Rev. Ver., </span><span class="font5">margin) Jesus’ faithful death was only the first triumphant step toward the ultimate bruising of the Serpent’s head at the battle of Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: casting all your care upon him.—1 Pet. 5:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is lovingly interested in all those in covenant relationship with him. He will keep his part of the covenant and will care for every individual as long as such one is obedient under his mighty hand, subject to its leading and guidance. That mighty hand will exalt all the lowly and faithful ones at the seasonable time. No matter where one is in the Lord’s arrangement, such one is in an exalted position, because favored with the knowledge and service of Jehovah and being in the way of life. The obedient “other sheep”, who maintain their integrity down to the final end of Armageddon, God will exalt in triumph over the wicked oppressors by bearing them safely through that battle and giving them the assignment to clean up the earth and bring forth righteous offspring under their invisible overlord, Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Love covereth a multitude of sins.—1 Pet. 4:8, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whatever has been a sinner’s past course, if there is true repentance and conversion to the Lord’s prescribed course, then they cover over those past sins, forget them, and deal with the repentant one on the basis of his restored relationship with the Lord. If sin has been committed against Christians personally, they readily forgive the repentant one who confesses and asks forgiveness, be it to the number of “seventy times seven”. They do not harbor hatred and let such personal matters split up the unity of Christians in fighting shoulder to shoulder against demonism and for the faith of the gospel. They love one another “for their works’ sake”, and because all are on the side of The Theocracy and the New World. They love one another in truth by seeking the everlasting welfare and success of each in the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">They gnash with their teeth at the “faithful and wise servant” class and express no sympathy with them in the world-wide persecution these undergo. They “weep”, not in repentance or remorse, but because of taking offense at the conduct of the faithful and because of being unable to put across their selfish aim and purpose against the faithful, and because of imagined injustices which they claim the Lord’s faithful committed against them. They profess to be “children of the kingdom”. Doubtless when, shortly, God resurrects from the dead the faithful prophets and witnesses of old and makes such the visible princely representatives of the Kingdom, the “evil servant” class will weep and grind their teeth. After seeing this, they go down at Armageddon. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During those few years Jephthah came in touch with his daughter, whom his vow had dedicated to Jehovah’s full-time service at His tabernacle in Shiloh. In his devoted daughter Jephthah left behind a monument on earth testifying to Jehovah’s triumph through the faith and devotion of those who held fast to his Theocracy and his faithful worship and service. Likewise, with the eventual passing off the earthly scene of the faithful remnant the pure worship of Jehovah will not vanish from the earth. They will leave behind the “princes in all the earth”, including the resurrected Jephthah, and the faithful devoted “great multitude”. All these will serve Jehovah God “day and night in his temple” in the new world, an everlasting testimony to the victory of Jehovah’s “strange work” now by his Greater Jephthah, Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sheep</span><span class="font5"> class see the good works of Jehovah’s witnesses in going from house to house preaching good tidings. They detect in the Kingdom message preached by such witnesses the “voice” or message of the Good Shepherd, and they follow him where his word leads them. They dissociate themselves from among the evilspeaking religionists, and the Shepherd-King gathers them to his right side. There they give thanks to Jehovah God for sending forth his witnesses. They join with his faithful remnant in glorifying God by showing forth his praise and declaring his name and kingdom throughout all the earth. Such “sheep” Jehovah by his King visits with protection and preservation during the tribulation of Armageddon. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I in him.—John 6:51-56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful following of Jesus’ earthly course in the flesh constitutes believing in him and partaking of him. The result thereof is eventually a sharing with him in “his resurrection” and being raised up to immortal life with him as members of the glorified body of Christ, “the body of his glory.” In the above words, at John 6, Christ Jesus was speaking to the typical covenant people of God, and not to Gentiles. His words, therefore, do not apply to those of humankind in general, but apply to those who are taken into the new covenant and who partake of the antitypical Manna and are made members of his “body”. This restriction of his words to such ones is proved by his reference to ‘drinking his blood’. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.—1 Pet. 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The mind of Christ is the mind or purpose never to sin just to escape suffering. To suffer thus in the flesh is to the glory of God and to the vindication of his name and Government. Hence it is better than to side-step suffering for righteousness’ sake and be pushed into the gross sin of covenant-breaking and disloyalty to God. Such sin means everlasting destruction, hence loss of all hope and right to life in the New World. He that in the unchangeable mind of Christ chooses and counts it a privilege to ‘suffer in the flesh’ as He set us the example “hath ceased from sin”. He does not for one moment entertain the thought of compromising with the world and committing the sin of treachery to God. Gladly suffering rather than to practice such sin means to be like Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">According to prophecy, and by virtue of the work Jehovah is having his witnesses do on earth, a great educational campaign is in progress. In these days special full-time publishers, as well as other Kingdom publishers, have a wonderful opportunity to go into small towns and villages and there aid honest people and instruct them in Bible study. The humble persons, though youthful or old, are in a safe condition to teach others. Jehovah aids and bestows favor upon the humble to accomplish his service. He instructs the elders to subject themselves to serve the spiritual needs of the younger ones who want to publish God’s kingdom, and not to exalt themselves and restrict knowledge and the means of gaining it to themselves. In turn, the younger persons should be subject to their seniors and learn from them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 25:6, Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This may refer to well-fed cattle whose bones are full of marrow, or to the most tender and delicate part of such animals, the unmarrowed fatness of their bones. Such figures of speech mean, therefore, the most delicate and tasty portions of the gospel of God’s kingdom, yes, a fat or abundant portion of such, so as to make the face of the ones feeding on it to shine with spiritual health and pleasure. Since the feast is unto all peoples of good-will, and which peoples shall live on the cleansed earth under the rule of the heavenly Zion, it means or includes the truths that apply directly to the Lord’s “other sheep”, such as their surviving the battle of Armageddon and entering into the New World and fulfilling the divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth.

<p><span class="font5">The indispensable part performed by God’s Word toward the very life and existence of the Christian church is declared by Jesus and his apostles. Said Jesus: “Except a man be bom of water [the water of God’s word] and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” (John 3:5) Says Paul: “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Rom. 10:17) Jehovah God provided the Bible as spiritual food for the church, because they need it continually. He did not say in any part of it that the church could or “would continue to exist unchanged without the Bible”. The Roman Catholic organization has existed “without the Bible”, but not so as to the true church. It sticks to the Bible and refuses to be changed by traditions of men. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The merry feasting pictures the spiritual feast that the Lord God spreads for the “prodigal” class in this “time of the end”, a feast of food stronger than the mere “milk of the word”. The strenuous work and very trying times demand nourishment more strengthening, sustaining and advanced than the easily digested liquid for those who are babes in the Word. It is Kingdom food, concerning the vindication of God’s name. Such is the feast and banquet foretold at Isaiah 25: 6. The “prodigal” class have Tain low in the dust’, “dead in trespasses and sins,” and it is a joyful thing when they hear God’s message and come to life as to his service; when they who have been lost among worldly pleasures suddenly come to themselves, find themselves, and are in turn found by the Good Shepherd and are brought into the Lord’s fold.

<p><span class="font5">Those so adorned do not keep this consecrated self of Kingdom devotion hidden away in their heart, with benefit to no one outside in the darkness of this world crisis. It is written: “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed [to confess him].” (Rom. 10:10,11) Hence they take part in the witness work to all nations, and thus confess the Lord God and his King and show what is in their hearts. (Joel 2: 28) It is only by thus testifying and taking on the appearance of a witness for the glorious Jehovah and his beauteous King that they identify themselves as ambassadors and representatives of the Righteous Government of the New World, the “world without end”.

<p><span class="font5">In such friendship this organization of “the Vine” and “the branches” must stay bound together. There is no disunity between vine and branches; it is no sectarian affair as in “Christendom”. Each branch pictures a disciple, which branch cannot be severed from the stock if it would live. For all of its sustenance and life it must depend upon the vinestock and the good care of the Husbandman, the Father in heaven, whose planting the Vine is. Quite appropriately, then, today in lands where the Nazi-Faseist-Vatican crowd have suppressed the open, public activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, these faithful, eovenant-keeping “branches” endeavor to keep in touch with the source of spiritual sustenance by the “grapevine route” or method.

All man-made governments of whatever political style have proved hopelessly futile. After this total war man’s greatest governmental experiment will be made. But disappointment will follow upon it as but an “hour” afterward, and then total world destruction. Not all the religion in the world will be able to save it from that fate. (1 Thess. 5:3; Rev. 17:12) Why foolishly be dragged into that destruction? Believe God’s Word, and turn now with faith and hope to his Theocratic Government under Christ, which is at hand. Subject yourself to it now, and prepare yourself for the grand success of that Government, with life and lasting benefits to result therefrom in the New World of righteousness.

<p><span class="font5">The way an elder or one in a position of responsibility can be an example to the flock is to be a faithful and true witness, just as Christ Jesus was. The basic actions of Christ Jesus when on earth show he was Jehovah’s “faithful and true witness”, going from house to house, village to village, and city to city. Therein he set the correct example for the flock. He did what was right. His faithful apostles followed in his steps. After Jesus was so painfully killed but was raised to life and glory, the apostles renewed their walk in his steps. They exhorted the Christians to follow them as they followed Jesus Christ. So, then, every one in a company organization having the position of a servant as an elder brother should be a mature example to the flock and be actively a Kingdom publisher with his brethren.

They declare, too, the day of God’s vengeance against the ungodly sinners who hide under the cloak of “more religion”. (Jude 14-16) By reason thereof the Lord’s “other sheep” are now being gathered away from such religionists and become the companions of Jehovah’s witnesses. They will have their lives preserved clear through the battle of Armageddon and will enter the New World never to see death themselves.

<p><span class="font5">As Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to his command to preach, have gone to as many nations as they could penetrate, our only Lord God has added to the nation. He not only has gathered the Ruth and Esther class, or newer and younger part of the remnant, but has also added the “strangers” that are welcome within the gates of our “strong city”, Zion. These “other sheep” the Good Shepherd has apparently only begun to bring into his fold into company with his free Nation represented by the remnant. The increasing of the Lord’s Nation has not yet reached to the populousness he has decreed for it before Armageddon. The increase thus far is to Jehovah’s glory. By a still greater increase and addition of “other sheep” He shall be further glorified among multitudes of “men of goodwill” from the sun’s rising to its going down.

<p><span class="font5">This middle period, by which the days of the “great tribulation” are being shortened, was not meant for riotous living by life-seekers. It was graciously inserted in order that the Kingdom gospel that leads to gaining eternal life might be proclaimed to all nations. The “prodigal son” class squandered the opportunity which such proclamation afforded for getting into God’s service. Acting on good terms with the “far country”, the world, they spent their money for that which is not bread and labored for that which satisfies not. Permitting the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches to choke up their lives and divert them from God’s purposed work for this period of grace before Armageddon’s fight, they have prodigally wasted time, opportunity, means.

The public activities of the apostles and other disciples both on and after the day Pentecost also prove that the use of the house-to-house way of preaching the gospel is proper and according to Jesus’ instructions and is under the guidance of the holy spirit of God then poured out. The house-to-house and back-call method of enlightening the common people is thus proved to be the Christ-like and God-ordained way for those who desire to serve and worship God in spirit and in truth today.

They are heady, headstrong, seeking headship for themselves. They do not appreciate that their fellows in the organization are not under their charge and dictation but are the Lord’s servants. They criticize and judge the Lord’s servants as if such ones were their own, and they “speak evil of dignities”, those whom the Lord has dignified by placing them in a responsible position in the organized body of Christ. They become meddlers, busybodies in other men’s matters, and are ambitious to be independent and higher in position than where the Lord has placed them.

Mindful of Scripture prophecies, they look for an association of nations to be formed which will constitute a supernational organization for world security, law and order. Let the nations build it as high as the tower of Babel, God’s Word yet stands true that only Jehovah and his reigning King are the “Higher Powers”. By their covenant with the Most High Sovereign and his King they are obliged to “obey God rather than men”.

Christ Jesus prayed for such ; and Jehovah by him will answer the heartfelt prayer of his assembled ones. The assembly will result in spiritual prosperity, peace, and approved line of action for them. The assembly is not yet complete.

They will then arise and go to the Father in consecration before the great spiritual famine of “Christendom” ends up with her destruction at Armageddon. Those who unselfishly serve the Most High God and who mercifully leave it to Him to judge those seeking him will imitate God and his Son Christ Jesus in welcoming the repentant “prodigal” class.

<p><span class="font5">May the Lord’s “other sheep” now pray to Jehovah God as “our Father”? Yes. Like the famished Egyptians of old, they turn their all over to Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus, and ask him to buy them with his sacrifice of redemption that they may get into the way of everlasting life, now, before Armageddon. By receiving the life-giving spiritual food the “other sheep” come into line to become the children of “The everlasting Father”, Christ Jesus, when he applies the merit of his ransom sacrifice in their behalf. As his own Father is Jehovah, the consecrated “other sheep” may address Jehovah as “our Father” when offering prayer. In Scripture a grandson regularly spoke to his father’s father (or grandparent) as “Father”, and all forefathers before one’s immediate parent were called “fathers”. Jehovah is the “First Father” to all acquiring life through His Son. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.—1 Pet. 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All God’s servants will obey this “ordinance of man” and will honor or properly esteem all those in or under God’s Theocratic organization whom he has honored or favored with the privilege of being his witnesses and ministers of the gospel. They love their brethren in Christ and their brethren in the faith, and seek to help them in keeping God’s commandments and so gaining eternal life. They fear only God; they know that Tear of man leadeth into a snare’. (Prov. 29:25) Hence they faithfully worship God and obey his commandments, without fear of what man can do to them. In joyful compliance with his precious commandment they honor his reigning King. They are not ashamed to confess the King before men. They esteem no privilege higher than to be an ambassador for Christ, preaching this gospel of the Kingdom everywhere. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And who is he that will injure you, if you become imitators of the good one?—1 Pet. 3:13, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The imitator of Jesus must persist in being true and without guile in his consecration to God. He must be faithful to God and his law and thereby maintain his integrity toward God unbroken. Then, regardless of what bodily or property damages the enemies may inflict, they cannot harm his standing and his unity with God and Christ or his life interests in the New World. “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.” (Matt. 10:28) Jehovah’s witnesses continue to imitate Christ Jesus in preaching the gospel from house to house and place to place, regardless of their so-called “legal standing” with the world. They know that Jesus’ example, though “illegal”, is the only good one, and imitating Him is the only safe course. To continue safe from real harm they must be faithful unto death.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing.—1 Pet. 3:17. </span><span class="font5">Why is it better? Because the suffering for welldoing according to God’s will is for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. It is in support of His side of the issue of universal domination, and it results in the lasting blessing of the one who thus suffers for a good conscience. How can it be Jehovah’s will that they should suffer unjustly who serve him in well-doing, keeping his commandments? Because thereby they must prove their integrity under the test at Satan’s hands and must prove him a blasphemer and Jehovah God true. Were God to shield them from the sufferings, he would be sparing them the test and hence would be depriving them of a part in vindicating his name. Suffering according to God’s will, when faithfully endured even to the death, results to the greatest good of the sufferer who keeps his integrity.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, ... we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: . . . Then Paul . . . answered.—Acts 24:2,5,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul proved these accusations false, and that the real cause for being haled before the court was because he preached Christ’s resurrection and his exaltation to be King of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. (Acts 24:15, 21) When in court, the apostle Paul did not yield to any rule to “keep religion or preaching out of your testimony”. He alertly saw to it that he included in his testimony a description of the work he was engaged in doing, what he was preaching, and his commission from the Lord which was his authority to do what he was doing at the time of his arrest. Thus he got in a powerful testimony for the Kingdom of God and exposed religion as anti-God.—Acts 26:1-29. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Let him glorify God for that name.” (</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth; Tischendorf)</span><span class="font5"> Why? Because God used Christ Jesus as the Founder of Christianity. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity</span><span class="font5"> means the doing of God’s will as Christ Jesus did it and left his disciples the example and the command to do. It means glorifying God “in this name”, that is, as a Christian or imitator of the Leader in Christianity. Bearing the name “Christian” does not detract from God’s name, Jehovah. The name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font5"> associates with it Jehovah God, because He foretold and also sent the “Christ” or “Messiah”. Hence when Jesus came to earth he came in his Father’s name and glorified it and was Jehovah’s witness. Consequently, to “suffer as a Christian” means to suffer with him and for like reason, that is, as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Whether scattered or congregated, our brethren are passing through the same afflictions and meeting the same temptations from Satan in his effort to turn them away from God’s kingdom and service. The situation is worse now than in the apostle’s day, but no greater burden will God let be laid upon his servant than he can stand or than comes upon others. The totalitarian arrangement causes care and worry, inducing to fear. Yet obey God, fear him, and cast all your cares upon him, for “he careth for you”. He is intensely interested in you as a publisher of his name and kingdom, because you are keeping your integrity and proving his great adversary a liar. His grace is enabling your brethren in the world to stand firm and uncompromising, never succumbing to the pressure of the Devil. Let this comfort and cheer you.

<p><span class="font5">Completely contrary to discouraging Bible study, Christ’s apostles strongly urged for the faithful and continual study of the holy Word of God. That Word now includes the inspired books and letters written by the apostles and their associates. The Devil and his demons would take away from the people Jehovah’s recorded Word. Religion is the Devil’s most subtle way of taking it away and substituting for it the human traditions of demon worship. The far-sighted Jehovah lovingly and wisely provided his written Word as an unchanging guiding light that his faithful servants and witnesses might not be misled by the traditions of false guides under demon control, but might be led unerringly in the way that conducts one to divine approval and life eternal.

<p><span class="font5">The “man of sin” class do not have the “pure lip” with which to call upon the name of the Lord to serve him in common consent with Jehovah’s remnant and their companions. Hence they are at odds with the “faithful and wise servant” class. They not only do not speak the Theocratic language of the faithful, but cast slurs at the Scriptural organization of Jehovah’s servants to misrepresent it and its purpose and work. They speak “good words and fair speeches” indeed, but to “deceive the hearts of the simple”. (Rom. 16:17,18) They talk sentimentally of the love of God. They affect gentleness and accordingly soft-pedal the hard message of the “day of vengeance of our God”. Their pronouncing of “sibboleth” is softer than the thicker, harsher “SHibboleth”. It is a “dead giveaway”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Abraham, calling him lord.—1 Pet. 3:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Subjection of such holy women pictured the subjection of Christians to the Theocratic rule, because such women were joined to men devoted to Jehovah God and his purpose, and not to men disobedient to God’s word of promise and his commandments. Abraham was used as a type of Jehovah God the Father in bringing forth the seed in whom all believing families of the earth will be blessed: “which seed is Christ.” Sarah was used to type God’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font5"> his organization, Zion, which brings forth the Seed. Sarah’s calling Abraham “lord” not merely indicated that the man is the head of the woman, but rather showed that Jehovah’s organization, including Christ Jesus, acknowledges and subjects itself to Jehovah God as “Lord”, the Supreme One, the great Theocrat. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">What a cheering promise! Christ Jesus has overcome the world, its persecution, its opposition, its temptations, and its trials, and has learned obedience by the things he suffered. So the footstep followers of Christ Jesus must overcome the world, and in so doing defeat the ends of persecution. They can and will do so, by God’s grace through Christ. The faithful must and will overcome all the temptations from the world and stand firm and immovable on Jehovah’s side, to His glory. Jesus, knowing that he had fought a good fight, had confidence in his Father that He would provide the grace for him to remain true and faithful to the very end. Thus Jesus would vindicate his Father’s name, what though he suffered the ignominy of dying on a tree, exposed to the profane gaze of religionists and their dupes. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">By the Lord’s revealed judgments and regulations the faithful remnant have learned righteousness and therefore shun the worldly contamination and unrighteousness of religion. The Lord’s “other sheep” have heard the judgments of Jehovah God proclaimed by His remnant of witnesses. Such of them as have already heeded the Kingdom message of this day of judgment have done good to the brethren of the King Christ Jesus and thus have learned righteousness. Their righteous acts of faith are seen in their zealous work in the witness field at the side of the remnant, the King’s brethren. More of these good-will “inhabitants of the world” will yet learn righteousness as a certain result of the continued proclamation of truth by the remnant and their companions. Such “inhabitants” will both learn and then do righteousness, as now commanded at Zephaniah 2: 3. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The word “communion” here means partnership, joint participation, a being partaker, fellowship. Hence justification from sins and unto life by faith in Jesus’ blood is not pictured by the drinking of the cup, since those drinking must already have been justified from sin. Rather, drinking of the cup means that the drinker lays down his justified human life. He forever foregoes the right and prospect to perfect life on earth after the Devil’s organization is cleared out and God’s rule is in undisputed sway over earth. Drinking the cup means fellowship with Christ Jesus in his sufferings and death on earth, and undergoing the reproaches that fell upon him for Jehovah’s sake, and maintaining one’s integrity blamelessly thereunder for the vindication of God’s name.

Faith in him and in the revelation of his purpose filled their heart. Their heart, or seat of motivation, moved their lips to bear bold and uncompromising witness to His supremacy as the only true and living God and to his promised Government of righteousness, and to expose the mimic god and his religion. Thus by faith they continued till death as Jehovah’s fearless witnesses. Their faith was in him and his covenant-promise concerning the woman’s Seed that shall bruise the Serpent’s head and in whom all believers of the nations shall be blessed.

They will be spared death at Armageddon, and will enter as survivors into the conditions on earth in the righteous New World. Continuing faithful thereafter, they shall never die or undergo the dissolution of their human bodies. This is a swallowing up of death in victory, never before possible for men, but now in prospect for “men of good-will”. The resurrection of the faithful men of old, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses from Abel to John the Baptist, to be “princes in all the earth”, this likewise will be a 'swallowing up of death in victory’. And Scriptural grounds exist to think this will take place on this day of Jehovah before Armageddon’s war is done. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

Those desiring life must set affection upon Christ Jesus as Lord, God’s Beloved One, because he is the One who bought us with the sacrifice of himself and who is therefore our Owner and Master. We are no more our own. We must obey the commandments and example of our Lord. We may not fear other creatures, even when the whole world is combined in conspiracy against Christ’s reigning over earth as King. Sanctify him in the vital part of you, in the heart, as being Jehovah’s Executioner with all power to destroy at Armageddon. Such sanctification of him will displace all fear of the terror which those wicked creatures have made in order to dominate the world.

<p><span class="font5">Already, prior to the full and complete revelation of Christ’s divine and royal glory, Jehovah’s witnesses rejoice. Why? Because by faith they see revealed through God’s Word the present glory of Christ. In the light of the fulfilled prophecies concerning the time of his glory they see that Jehovah now reigns by his Son and Vindicator. God’s kingdom has begun and is here! It has cleared the Devil and his demons out of the heavenly part of God’s universe. Christ’s glorious vindication of his Father’s name is at hand. By faithfully keeping their blamelessness toward Jehovah under fiery suffering Christ’s followers may share with him in clearing God’s name and proving Satan a liar and mimic god.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus thus recognized and made plain the right of his faithful imitators to approach the doors of the people without any prior license from worldly authorities and without any previous invitation from the householders and to knock at the door to call those inside to hear the Kingdom news. Jesus showed it is up to the man to decide whether he wants to hear the message and take Jehovah’s witness inside the house or not. If he does, the man will sup at the Lord’s table by means of the message Jehovah’s witness brings. No anti-doorbell-ringing ordinance can take away or make void this God-given right of Jehovah’s witnesses.

He notes the difference between their message and his Theocratic “meat in due season”, and that, like the rebellious Ephraim-ites of old, they are unable to publish and declare the Theocratic test-word “Shibboleth”, but are pretenders, hypocrites. He is fully aware that they do not do his will by working peacefully and unitedly with his approved “faithful and wise servant” and in obedience to Theocratic rule.

The “evil servant” class have been caught in their unfaithful course against the Lord and his brethren, and have been cast out of God’s organization. The dividing of the nations as “sheep” and “goats” is proceeding. Those assembled to the Lord Jehovah rejoice at his present judgments and at the prospect of coming judgments at Armageddon by his judicial Vindicator, the Greater David, Christ Jesus. The body members who are called to sit with him in his heavenly throne are privileged while on earth to declare the recorded judgments against the Kingdom foes, and thus “to execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints”.

Read the Bible, God’s Word, and you will find a continuous record of the promises and acts of deliverance by Jehovah, which shall culminate shortly in a new world of freedom evermore under a Government of liberation. Complete deliverance comes with the establishment of that Government by God and its action against all oppressors of man and all blasphemers of God’s name, by destroying them at the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”. But even before that there is a release from subjugation to this world that is possible for men to enjoy. How ?

One need not necessarily tie in with the official part of Satan’s organization to commit such spiritual fornication or harlotry. If one does not love God’s kingdom and take his stand for it, he can not escape defilement with this world but must be loving it and its pleasures. God commands his people: “Love not the world.” Indifference to the Kingdom truth, and a desire to please and appear respectable to the world so as to share in with its pleasures, is friendship with it and, spiritually, is like mingling with harlots, as the prodigal son of the parable did. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">From time to time an ordinance, or “creature”, is made concerning other servants of the Lord in the Theocratic organization, such as “governors”, which governors are sent by the King Christ Jesus to care for the interests of the visible Theocratic organization. They are representatives of the great Governor, Christ Jesus. (Matt. 2:6) The word here translated “governors” is derived from the word applied by the apostle Paul to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“chief</span><span class="font5"> men among the brethren”, at Acts 15:22, and to organization servants “which have the rule over”, at Hebrews 13: 7,17, 24.

Not only had he declared his Father’s name when with his disciples on earth, but also, when glorified in heaven, he “will declare it”. Why? Because Jehovah’s name is to be vindicated. The Master has clearly pointed out that it will not be an easy time for any follower of his in this time of the end, whether one is of the remnant or of the “other sheep”. It is faithfulness that counts for eternal life in vindication of Jehovah’s name, as his King Christ Jesus has exemplified to us. Forever shall that name be memorialized on this earth, not alone to the end of the old world, but to eternity in the New World, which is a “world without end”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

For what must he suffer? Not for committing sin nor for canceling the sin of humankind, but for doing the will of Jehovah God. It was not his undeserved sufferings, but the shedding of his blood and his death as a perfect man that redeemed what Adam forfeited through sin. It cleansed away the sin of repentant and converted sinners. Thus Jesus “his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree” on which he died. But did the Jews have Jesus nailed to the tree that he might die as man’s redeemer and as the remover of the sin of all believers in him? Not at all. Another thing and far more important was the issue. What was that? The vindication of Jehovah’s name by the “kingdom of heaven”.

<p><span class="font5">The claim of any individual or religious organization to be the interpreter of God’s sacred Word is false and misleading. No creature or organization on earth can truly presume to sit as the supreme tribunal of interpretation of the Holy Bible. Jehovah God, the Supreme Judge, has set up no such supreme court of interpretation upon our planet. His Associate Judge, Christ Jesus, has appointed no so-called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">vicar</span><span class="font5"> to act for him as interpreter to His church. In ancient time the faithful Hebrew Joseph said: “Do not interpretations belong to God?” Jehovah God is therefore the only Supreme Court of interpretation of His inspired Word. The heavenly Father chose to call into service his beloved Son as his divinely inspired Interpreter of the whole Word of God. At Job 33: 22-24 he foretold his Son acting in such capacity.

The accomplishment of that purpose will bring vindication to God’s name which has been misrepresented by the mimic god.

Jesus’ faithful course of integrity toward God even unto death proved him worthy of a resurrection to life in the spirit and a return to his Father in heaven; and thereby Christ Jesus was opening up a way for believing humankind to come to God. By his ransom sacrifice Jesus takes away the sin of such believers, and by this they are made acceptable to God as his children. Of old Moses was mediator between God and Israel. Now Christ Jesus, whom Moses prefigured, is the “one mediator between God and men” of spiritual Israel. Hence approach to God may be, not direct, but through his Son and in his name.

<p><span class="font5">The God of heaven bids his consecrated ones to fix their eyes upon The Theocracy and to be impressed with what His Word says about its invulnerable strength and protective power. “Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.” (Ps. 48:12,13) So viewing The Theocracy, the “pilgrims and strangers” put trust in it and flee to it for refuge and rely upon no postwar global government. The longer the remnant and the “other sheep” abide within Jehovah’s service arrangements and study his revelations of truth, the ipore they marvel at the strength, glory and righteousness of The Theocracy under Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is of Zion these “Judeans” are singing, the strong and invincible Theocratic Government of the true and living God. An international police force, no matter of what strength and striking power, cannot guarantee a durable peace with freedom and security, nor will it be able to stand the terrible shaking of all man-made things at Armageddon. The one and only hope of lovers of life and liberty is God’s “strong city”, The Theocracy. Those who take refuge in and under it find themselves encircled with indestructible walls and bulwarks of God’s protection and power, and which he has appointed to guarantee the salvation, security, deliverance and endless freedom of all who faithfully abide there. This is the truth! even though the enemies scoff, and try to suppress “this song” of the Kingdom. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">When he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him.—Mark 7:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On and on you may go through Jesus’ service record. Repeatedly the report is that “he went into an house” and crowds assembled and he gave them Kingdom testimony. At various houses he instructed his disciples privately with fuller information concerning things he had just preached openly to the people. Thus in after-meetings in the homes he gave further information to those seeking more knowledge and understanding. However, he did not stay at such houses and keep to himself and his private circle of apostles. The record stipulates that “he departed thence”, for more field activity. (Matt. 13:36, 53) When a guest at a home he felt under no obligation to practice religion. He was there primarily as Jehovah’s witness rather than as a guest at meal, so he helped the household rather than just indulge himself.

<p><span class="font5">Scriptures make it very clear that the “evil servant” class would prominently display itself in the time of the end, and the more so the nearer we get to the final end of all of Satan’s crowd. Satan’s chief spirit prince, Gog, will specially use the peculiarly informed “evil servant” class in the conspiracy with all his other worldly elements against Jehovah’s faithful spiritual Israelites and the “other sheep”. Thus the “evil servant” class will more openly betray their evil co-operation with all other elements of Satan’s organization, religious, political and commercial, and unmistakably show they are one with these, “eating and drinking” with them as a part of this world. The sign of the two “servants” must therefore become sharper and more prominent. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have a right to make a defense, and that to the entire world which is opposed. It is not proselyting for them to spread abroad the explanation of their glorious hope, but is in “defence of the gospel” which is under assault and misrepresentation. Such published account of their Scriptural hope is to the highest interest of the people. The salvation of individuals to life eternal is at stake, and opportunity should be afforded each person to choose intelligently the hope and way to salvation. It is not in accord with right nor with the blatantly proclaimed “freedoms” which are promised an unhindered operation in the postwar arrangement, when political bodies, sustained by courts, legislate to suppress the “defence” of the truth, to anyone. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

Jehovah’s remnant of witnesses, and also their companions as foreshadowed by Noah’s sons and their wives, have faith in God’s Word which tells of the approaching universal tribulation, the battle of Armageddon. They resist the sin of unbelief or religion which infects the whole world, and bear witness of Jehovah and of the things to come in vindication of his name and word, like the “preacher of righteousness”, Noah. Moved with godly fear, they live and prepare for the New World and take refuge in the ark of Jehovah’s organization under the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses of today, who are the adopted and anointed sons of God, are the remnant of the body of Christ, the Seed of Abraham. They are children of the free organization, the heavenly Jerusalem; they are no part of this world which is in bondage to the “god of this w’orld” and his religion and wickedness. Although in the world, they are not of it. They advocate and belong to the Theocratic Government of the righteous New World, which world is at hand with freedoms such as men have never known for six thousand years. Not only are these free, but all persons of good-will who forsake religion, accept the truth, consecrate themselves to God, and become companions of Jehovah’s witnesses, even all these “other sheep” are equally free with them. Who has made them free, and for what purpose? “For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore.”—Gal. 5:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “fruits” of the Kingdom are the message and the proclamation activities of the Kingdom. It is notorious that the clergymen did not hail or announce Jesus as King and preach his presence. To Jesus’ faithful footstep followers was given the privilege of bringing forth the fruits of the Kingdom and holding them out for the people to feed upon. His anointed followers took up the fruits of the Kingdom as God placed these in their hands, and bore such fruits forth to the spiritually famished people. Such devoted and anointed followers of Christ Jesus, bringing forth the Kingdom fruits, are thereby identified as Jehovah’s “holy nation”. They became a part thereof by forsaking religion and believing on Christ Jesus as Redeemer and King and consecrating themselves to follow his footsteps in doing Jehovah’s will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That does not signify that the faithful remnant or society of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses are his earthly tribunal of interpretation, delegated to interpret the Scriptures. No; Christ Jesus the King has not entrusted that office to them. He merely uses the “servant” class to publish the interpretation after the Supreme Court by Christ Jesus reveals it. He causes the facts to come to pass visibly which are in fulfillment of the prophecy or dark saying or misunderstood scripture. Thereafter “in due season” he calls such clarification of prophecy and scripture to the attention of his “servant” class. Thereby he makes them responsible to make known the meaning of such scriptures to all members of the household of faith. This is 'giving them meat in due season’.

<p><span class="font5">As long as there are homes of the people, Jehovah’s ambassadors for Christ must go to the houses, announcing the Kingdom, declaring the impending day of God’s vengeance, and pointing out God’s provided way of escape to safety and life. Of old, when Isaiah came forward to the call to action with a “Here am I; send me!” the Lord gave him the commission as a witness of Jehovah. Then the prophet asked, “Lord, how long?” and the Lord answered: “Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed men far away.” To Isaiah’s modern counterpart, Jehovah’s witnesses, that means, Until God Almighty brings the final end upon “Christendom” and all Satan’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Thus John speaks of the unswerving efforts of those kings to bring glory only to God’s kingdom. That Government of the righteous new world is no system of rule deriving its existence and power from the consent of the governed people. It does not rise up from the earth by the creative powers of men’s hands and brains. It comes down from heaven, from God, and hence is Theocratic. Jehovah God is the Supreme Head of it, and under him Christ Jesus is “Lord of lords, and King of kings”. His 144,000 body members who suffer with him and are faithful unto death are called to reign with him as such “kings”. Wherefore John writes of Him and his associates thus: “The prince of the kings of the earth.

<p><span class="font5">Particularly from 1936 on, Christ Jesus by his remnant has plunged the cold steel of Theocratic truth into the paunch of King Eglon and caused his dirt to be exposed. Since then, also, the Lord’s “other sheep” have been fulfilling tbe picture of Jael, who took the hammer and tent-pin and nailed Captain Sisera’s head to the ground. (Judg. 3:12-30; 4:18-24) Thereafter, according to the ancient type, the power of the enemy over Jehovah’s chosen nation was broken. Today, as a result of like action, the totalitarian monstrosity and the religious lords are as dead to Jehovah’s people. Spiritually, therefore, Jehovah’s remnant of witnesses are free. The Jael class, or “other sheep”, are standing unbreakably with the remnant in this freedom wherewith Jehovah by Christ Jesus has made them free.

<p><span class="font5">The earthly companions of the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses possess the same full measure of devotion to Jehovah and his King. In the warfare against demonism or religion they are willing to die with the remnant rather than compromise, retreat, quit witnessing and break their integrity and love toward God and Christ Jesus. With unwavering trust in God they both look forward into the immediate future and continue planning to press the aggressive warfare against the religion of the world and for the righteous worship of the new world. While yet in the wicked old world they know that “this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith”.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus’ desire was that these faithful ones still left in the world after he had gone might have the same joy of the Lord fulfilled in them as was in Jesus due to magnifying his Father’s name always. He gave them God’s Word, and because of this the world has hated them • for they and the message are not of the world, even as Jesus was and is not of this world. For like reasons Jehovah’s witnesses are hated today and suffer. Why are they let suffer? Jesus in prayer did not ask that they be relieved of the test of their integrity toward God. Hence he prayed, not that they be taken out of the world, but that God keep them from the evil one, the enemy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

Such wine or truth smacking of God’s kingdom under Christ is of foremost importance. It has been preserved all these centuries in God’s Word&lt; Yet, when it is brought forth for the feast on this day of Jehovah it is just as strong, flavorful, well-scented, pure and gladdening to the righteous heart as that made miraculously by Christ Jesus at the wedding feast in Cana.

Nor is any mere man, dead or alive, the head or leader of those who hold to Jehovah’s approved organization. Christ Jesus is their invisible and heavenly Head by God’s appointment, and the Watch Tower Society under him follows the Theocratic rule and acts as his servant in behalf of all those today who choose Jehovah God and his new world. All personal selfish features have been removed from the Society. The “elective elder” system of company rule has been cleared out; also the giving of worldly titles. The same service requirements have been applied to each and all as witnesses of Jehovah. The Society has devoted itself entirely to the service of “the Higher Powers” and to the Theocratic rule. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This does not mean that Jehovah’s witnesses make their own laws, but that in a conflict between laws they obey His Theocratic laws, and such laws should be recognized in courts where the Bible is sworn upon by persons testifying. The course of Jehovah’s witnesses is not one of anarchism, but of godliness. They do not use their Christian liberty for a cloak under which to commit maliciousness or vice and wickedness, using the religious excuse that the end justifies the use of criminal means. Their liberty is to do all the good God commands and to obey Him rather than men, and that in all good conscience. Theirs is a safe liberty, because while exercising it they act “as the servants of God”. They are his “bond-servants”, being bought with the blood of his Son. Hence they cannot be the servants of men.—1 Cor. 6:20; Gen. 47:19. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 11:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is it that highlights the foregoing historic account? The undying faith of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph in Jehovah’s declared word of promise. Being obliged to live out their lives without having the word of promise fulfilled did not weaken their faith, but they witnessed to that announced purpose of Jehovah and passed along the sure word of God to others for their guidance in the midst of this world. To the day of death they were faithful witnesses of Jehovah; never did they yield to the sin of unbelief and conform their lives to this world. They reared their offspring “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord”. In this unwavering course of practical faith they are examples to Jehovah’s witnesses now.

Regardless of what the husband is, they should show themselves of God’s organization </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Sarah)</span><span class="font5"> by being subject to the Greater Abraham in holiness of devotion to him and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. They should adorn themselves with the identity of a witness of Jehovah by engaging in the declaration of his name and kingdom and thus prove themselves “labourers together with God”, the Greater Abraham.

God’s Word assures them, yea, they have the inward conviction, that they have His approval. Hence their joy of heart no man can take away from them. In the midst of the present frightful conditions those who put their confidence in Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government are not disturbed or afraid. By the conspiracy against truth and righteousness the demons terrorize the earth. All men, the rulers and the ruled, stand in fear of this organized conspiracy and its power, and are afraid to strike for freedom from the demons and the power of religion.

<p><span class="font5">That was the first resurrection from the dead to life eternal.

All his body members, who copy his example and prove faithful in their integrity, suffering even unto death, shall share with Jesus in that “first resurrection”. By it they are changed from flesh or human to spirit, that is, they are raised to life in the spirit in the heavenly courts with Jesus. “It [the church body, the 'body of Christ’] is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.” (1 Cor. 15:44) Thus for Jesus and his faithful “body” members the suffering for Jehovah’s vindication precedes a share in the first resurrection.—Rev. 20:4,6.

He knew that the old world was certainly progressing to its end, the signs of which Jesus had foretold to him and other disciples. The final end of all things of the old world was to come suddenly, like the flood of Noah’s day, like a thief in the night. Hence Peter could say in his day: “But the end of all things hath drawn near.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> Nevertheless, his words were specially guided as to form of expression because they were specifically written for our admonition upon whom the end of the world has come. In 1914 the “war in heaven” began and the “prince of this world” was cast out of heaven, and his demon hosts with him. His time is now short. The final end of all things of his world is at hand.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is not the author of confusion, but is the remover of confusion from his devoted people who both pray and seek to know the truth. Although the understanding of his “servant” class has cleared up and has been corrected since 1918, yet the text of God’s infallible Word has not changed and its information has been there all the time from days of old. Jehovah has used his Messenger and Interpreter at the temple to cleanse away, little by little and point by point, any misunderstanding which was due to our having been in contact with religion in the past or due to not having the fulfilled facts at hand because it was not yet God’s due time. Thus Jehovah by Christ Jesus continues to this day to lead us in the path of truth, and we follow the revealed decisions of the Supreme Court of Interpretation.

Our Creator will take care of our “souls”, our life-interests in the New World, but only if we commit these unto him by fearlessly keeping on in well doing, obeying his commandments.

Until Jehovah’s “strange act” desolates the houses of all persons not of good-will toward Him and his Theocratic rule by Christ Jesus, his ambassadors must continue going throughout the land ‘marking in the foreheads’ those who ‘sigh and cry’ at the religious abominations and who long for the manifestation of God’s power and the complete bringing in of the “new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness”. Proverbs 14: 25 declares: “A true witness delivereth souls.” No greater service to the people of all nations and to the glory of God could there be than to bear witness to Jehovah’s way of deliverance.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">There arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.—Luke 15:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">citizen</span><span class="font5"> is an exploiter of labor, is conscienceless, or has no appreciation of a conscience acquainted with God’s Word. He is interested only in the old world which is far from God and has no part with the new world of God’s promise. Under the dire famine for hearing God’s Word through “Christendom’s” channels, the “prodigal” class attach themselves to the programs and machinery of her ruling classes and go to work for them and their old world. Their normal way of living depends upon such enforced work. What pangs of conscience they have that their job is unclean they must disregard. They are not serving the Giver of life, Jehovah God, but are feeding a selfish, unclean worldly class with husks for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">swine.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen.—Isa. 65:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “faithful and wise servant” of the Lord is a visible symbol of Christ’s side of the great issue, the side in favor of Jehovah’s universal domination over all living creatures. “That evil servant” is a visible symbol of the opposing side in this primary issue. Both “servants” are now active, each in behalf of his respective side of the issue. The hour of decision is here. The choice must be either to become companions with the “faithful and wise servant” and loyally serve Jehovah and his Kingdom with his “servant”, or to join the “evil servant” class and weep and gnash the teeth against God’s visible organization and at the last suffer fiery destruction. Read Isaiah 65:13-16, and heed with wisdom the Kingdom sign thus given. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled,.—Luke 21:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New Jerusalem, which God has made the seat of the real Theocracy, shall never have Gentile heel press down upon it. The “times of the Gentiles” ran out and ended at the birth of The Theocracy in 1914. The Gentile powers, forming a postwar association of nations in opposition to the Theocratic rule of the earth, face annihilation in the battle of Armageddon. Since 1918 they have made assault after assault upon the visible representatives of The Theocracy, Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions; but these have closed their ranks with the worship of Jehovah God as the binding tie. The line holds! The enemy aggressions fail to dent their unity or to wear out the strength of their devotion to Theocratic rule or to stop the “strange work” of witnessing to Jehovah’s name and kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And he smote thrice, and stayed.—2 Ki. 13:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unlike the king of Israel, let Jehovah’s representatives on earth of His kingdom not stay the offensive nor slack the hand. Clad in the full armor of God, they will in the remaining action of the Elisha work carry on the offensive against demonism without letup. Let them take the arrowshaft of Theocratic truth and shoot against the land of demonism; it is “the arrow of Jehovah’s deliverance!” So take the arrows of truth, and bundle them together into a strong, unbreakable, invincible union of truth. Then smite the earth, or visible part of demonism, not once, nor twice, nor thrice, but as with a continuing smiting until Almighty God puts it into the mind of the “beast” and its “ten horns” to rid themselves of the great “harlot”. Thereafter, Jehovah’s King will destroy the “beast” and its “ten horns”. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 26:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s judgments written aforetime have had bold declaration and doomed those religious, totalitarian “lords” to destruction. They are for ever dead to the Lord’s people already and shall never again live as “higher powers” to them. They are deceased; and those “Rephaim”, or totalitarian-religious giants of Satan’s organization, shall never again rise to spiritual power over Jehovah’s free nation and put them in any bondage to the Lord’s enemies, either now or in the postwar period of a super-State, dominated by religion. Till Armageddon’s fight they may continue to trouble Jehovah’s people. When they do decease at Armageddon’s war of execution, they shall literally go into extinction, without hope of rising.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.—Heb. 11:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The remnant of Jehovah’s “holy nation” of witnesses is now marching around the imposing stronghold of religion. It is an organization of unbelief in God’s Word and of opposition to his Kingdom purpose. His witnesses have laid siege against “organized religion” by simply tramping about in full view of the enemy religionists and bearing witness to Jehovah’s name and kingdom and proclaiming his Word. This requires faith to keep it up to the completion of the witness period. Those who endure to the end of the “strange work” will have their faith rewarded. Shortly they will give the shout of triumph, and God’s wonderworking power will bring down the protection behind which the unbelieving religionists hide themselves, and the God whom they reproached will execute them in the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat.—Luke 15:22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was a festal occasion, not a time for rebuking the “prodigal” class. How fitting then the clean long robe, worthy of a son of God, showing their identification as such. The ring showed them as rich toward God and having authorization to serve at His house as sons voluntarily serving him. The shoes made the once unclean feet look beautiful as walking in the paths of sonship of God, righteous paths. Such feet were now “shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace”, to bear the good news that God will bruise Satan under Christ’s feet shortly, thus bringing in everlasting peace on earth to “men of good-will”. They are God’s “free men”, no longer ‘swineherds’. As sons they may serve God at his temple. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And they shall be all taught of God.—John 6:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has only one channel for dispensing his free education to life eternal. That channel is his Theocratic organization, to which it is written prophetically, at Isaiah 54:13: “And all thy children shall be disciples of the Lord [Jehovah].” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser) </span><span class="font5">Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the great Teaching Faculty of the organization. In spite of persecution for His name’s sake, Jehovah’s witnesses do not lose sight of the true Teachers, who guide to life. As it is written: “Yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.” (Isa. 30:20) Jehovah’s witnesses look to their Teachers, God and his royal Son, to interpret the Bible for them in the due time, and then hasten to discharge their duty by bringing such teaching to all those who are of good-will to Jehovah and his Kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken.—Isa. 25:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of their steadfastness and constancy in his Kingdom-publication service, Jehovah does not reproach or “curse” his people. (Rev. 22:3,4) Nor can the enemy reproach his witnesses as being outcasts from the Lord and weaklings subject to the pressures of the day. All nations of the world may hate, persecute, falsely accuse and hurl bad names at Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, but they cannot reproach God’s people with being unfaithful and quitting Jehovah’s service and abandoning his organization. Rather, these hold fast their integrity under all endeavors of Babylon to make them curse God. Thereby they prove the Devil a liar and vindicate God as being true. When Jehovah preserves his remnant and their faithful companions at the battle of Armageddon and the enemy hosts are killed, this will completely and for ever remove all reproach from God’s people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made . . . for kings and all that are in high place; . . . This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 2:1-3, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such prayer is for the honor and glory of God and the advancement of his Kingdom interests on earth. Hence it is good and acceptable in His sight to offer such prayers and supplications. A prayer for the King, Jehovah’s King, is written at Psalm 72:1. David prayed for his son, the king of the typical Theocracy, and that prayer would now be offered up for the King of the true and lasting Theocratic Government. (1 Chron. 29:10,19) Jehovah God is the “King eternal” and Jesus Christ is his King of The Theocracy of the New World. As we look forward to the vindication of Jehovah’s name by his King at Armageddon, we continue to pray for Kings, saying: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.-Ps. 138:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After Jehovah’s royal Associate Judge came to the temple in 1918 for judgment and the purification of his people, Jehovah God used him to cleanse away misunderstanding of his Word. The light continues to grow brighter, and the perfect day is at hand, as we walk on where our Guide and Interpreter leads us. (Prov. 4:18; Ps. 25:9) Thus the great Supreme Interpreter magnifies now his infallible Word. Shortly, at the battle of Armageddon, Jehovah by his Associate Judge and Executioner will vindicate that Word. He will also magnify his holy name and destroy all opposing kings of this world. For that reason his faithful remnant, who are in line to be “kings and priests” with Christ Jesus, bow toward Jehovah God, who is representatively in his holy temple by Christ Jesus. Their beloved earthly companions bow with them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>
