<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Big Kansas Icebox</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The world’s biggest icebox will be at Atchison, Kans. It will have a capacity of 12,000,000 cubic feet, will hold 60,000 to 70,000 tons of perishable food at a fixed temperature of between 30 and 32 degrees, and is expected to save the government $3,400,000 a year, and in itself to equal about 10 percent of the entire public cooler space of the United States. This huge refrigerating unit is being installed in a limestone mine, which is of such shape and capacity and has such a large degree of natural insulation that it requires only a relatively small amount of refrigerating machinery to make it suitable as a place for government storage of eggs, lard, and other things that require constant low temperatures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Monkeys’ Disgrace</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Three monkeys sat in a cocoanut tree Discussing things as they’re said to be. Said one to the other, “Now listen, you two; There’s a certain rumor that can’t be true: That man descended from our noble race. The very idea is a disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No monkey ever deserted his wife, Starved her babies and ruined her life; And you’ve never known a mother monk To leave herbabies with others to bunk, Or pass them on from one to another, Till they scarcely know who is their mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And .another thing you’ll never see:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A monk build a fence ’round a cocoanut tree And let the cocoanuts go to waste, Forbidding all other monks to taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why, if I put a fencm around a tree, Starvation will force you to steal from me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here’s another thing a monk won’t do: Go out at night and get on a stew, Or use a gun or club or knife ■ To take some other monkey’s life. Yes, man descended, the ornery cuss; But, brother, he didn’t descend from us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Volume XXV! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N. Y., Wednesday, December 6, 1944 . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 958</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Franco the Superstitious</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">T IS more than two years since, on a spring day in Lisbon, Portugal, there was “the fanfare of military trumpets” and “down an avenue spread with rose petals, guarded by a military contingent, was borne the statue of Our Lady of Fatima” while on the sidewalks thousands of people cried in Portuguese, “Our Lady of Peace, give us Peace.” You know that Mary did not get the prayers, or else was not interested, or else did not know Portuguese, or else answered No. But Franco would never have noticed anything about the results. He is too superstitious. Had he been there, he would have been taken in, as was the entire crowd. The whole thing was un-scriptural, and it was foolish. (The pope himself admitted, to Cardinal Schuster, of Milan, in February, 1944, that he was at that time powerless to take any efficacious steps in favor of peace, and so admits that the prayers to the Portuguese Mary went to the Devil.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franco is a superstitious Catholic, and he would have accepted as gospel truth the statement of the “Right Reverend” Silvestre Sancho, of the University of Santo Tomas, in Manila, that the bloody fratricidal war which he successfully waged against his fellow Catholics in Spain was indeed “a fight to the death between the Eucharist, which is the living Jesus, and Atheism, disguised under the cloak of Communism”. Yet nothing could have been a bigger falsehood. The Spanish Catholic Republicans were merely defending the Spanish Catholic Republic against a traitor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franco himself stated that it was the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholic religion “that has inspired our genius”. If he has the genius of a good street-sweeper he has never shown it. When he betrayed his country, he “prayed to a Madonna that the ship convoy launched against the Loyalists should get safely from Tangier to Spain”. The traitors got across all right, but, as there are no feminine evil spirits, these prayers went to one of the male devils friendly to Franco, and procured the desired results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Pope</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Wcw in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a Hurry</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pope was in a hurry to show Franco that he was with him in all he did. Over a year and a half before Franco’s treason had succeeded, the pope gave him diplomatic standing. Six months later the “Reverend Father” James M. Gillis, C.S.P., editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic World,</span><span class="font5"> went into raptures over him. First came a column of flattering praise, and then the real point that, “Like Cardinal O’Connell and Cardinal Hayes and the Holy Father, I find it difficult that ho can have ordered indiscriminate bombing of densely populated cities”; but he did, and then the pope (April 18, 1938) wired Franco, “We send from the bottom of our heart a message propitious of divine favor and the apostolic benediction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pope’s world conspiracy against the Spanish Republic, published in a book in Burgos, Spain, was disclosed in a two-column story from Paris published in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> of August 7, 1938. From that story it is clear that 900 cardinals, archbishops and bishops joined to back Franco in his treason. The foreword to that 50,000-word document or book was written by Cardinal Pacelli (the present pope), and the object of it was to line up the whole world against the Spanish Catholic Republic and for Franco the Traitor. It succeeded. The next spring, April 1, 1939, Franco had won and the pope sent him his congratulations and his “apostolic blessing”. This was bad for Franco, because the pope’s blessings usually go crosswise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two weeks later, April 16, 1939, the new pope, Pius XII (Pacelli) speaking in Spanish, extended congratulations for the victory, in a broadcast to Spain. In it he called Franco the “illustrious chief of your state”, and mentioned his “noble and Christian sentiments” which are even to this day still hidden from all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Blaming God for It</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was not long after these hypocrisies before World War II was on. It would not do to blame Franco for this, and his comrades Hitler and Mussolini, so the pope put the blame on God, in his broadcast on October 31, 1942. That seems to be the idea back of his statement (in Portuguese) that the war was the result of the world’s own iniquities. If he had come right out and blamed Franco, it would almost surely have pointed the finger of suspicion at himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1942 Archbishop Spellman went out on an errand spending money for the United States government He visited the pope, and said that gentleman “thinks, works, prays and literally dies for peace”. That being the case, why didn’t he do some of that when he was prodding the entire Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the world over, to get behind Franco in his rebellion against the legitimate government of Spain? This Throbbing with sorrow’ stuff should be consistent. A little throbbing before robbing a henrpost is better than a whole lot. of throbbing afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many Americans who really know what happened. Harold Glenn Cuthrell, writing in the Raleigh </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News and Observer,</span><span class="font5"> remarked:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a series of current articles appearing in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Collier's</span><span class="font3"> entitled “Action This Day”,’ Archbishop Francis J. Spellman writes of his audience and conversation with Franco, the dictator and tyrant of Spain. It appears that the archbishop is deeply impressed with this despot and murderer of thousands of Spaniards. And we will not forget that Franco ordered out of Spain all Protestants, and all Freemasons were either murdered or compelled to flee Spain for refuge in friendly countries. We have not forgotten the brutalities and crimes of this wicked man who idolized and admired the arch criminal Hitler •and the bombastic Mussolini, And we remember that Hitler and Mussolini supported Franco in his war of extermination against the Spanish Loyalists and all who believed in freedom and democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But listen to Archbishop Spellman writing of Franco:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“My impressions of him are in accordance with his reputation as a very sincere, serious and intelligent man. . . . During the entire audience he talked in Spanish and I talked in Italian. . . . We understood each other perfectly. . . . Whatever criticism has been made of General Franco (and it has been considerable), I cannot doubt that he is a man loyal to his God, devoted to his country’s welfare, and definitely willing to sacrifice himself in any capacity and to any extent for Spain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How can a mart be loyal to his God and his country’s welfare when he murders his people for believing in freedom and decency, and by his crimes brings poverty, starvation, degradation and desolation to his country?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It isn’t so long since a wireless went out from Rome that Monsignor Enrique Pla y Deniel, primate of Spain, would be made a cardinal shortly, being “highly regarded in influential Vatican circles because of his democratic views”. The inference that any clerical in touch with Franco the Butcher could have democratic views is so silly that it is a wonder the reporter had the nerve to send it even as propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Fathers” O’Flanagan and Rodes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some honest Catholic priests visited America, in the effort to help the downtrodden Spanish Catholic Republicans. One of these, “Reverend Father” Michael O’Flanagan, of Ireland, brought 500 people to their feet in an ovation in Detroit, when he had the courage to say that the .official Catholic Church had held collections in Ireland to buy medical supplies for Franco, “on the grounds that he was lighting for Christianity and against the destruction of the churches” but that “this same official church . . . denied admission to the church of the bodies of those who had fallen in the struggle for Irish freedom”. lie was to have spoken at Milwaukee two days later, but the liberty-haters worked the telephone overtime and by the time he got there the hall in which he was to have spoken was refused, and he was being blackguarded all over the country, by the Hierarchy. At Scranton he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The war in Spain is between the privileged classes and the rank and file. ... In Spain the church has never come out of the Middle Ages. The bishops were selected by counsels between the government and the pope. When Alfonso fled six years ago people began to think for themselves, and then a liberal government resulted, of which the Communists were less than 5 percent of the parliament. . . . Then the old pampered Royalist Army became irked and, instigated by Mussolini and encouraged by Hitler, rebelled against civil government. . . . And they went across to Africa and brought a crowd of Mohammedan men from Africa to comt in and assist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time of the American Revolution in 1776 there was only one part of this continent that had a highly organized Catholic church, and that was the province of Quebec, and in 1776 the only Catholic bishop on this continent excommunicated all his subjects that joined the army under George Washington....</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Really it is a fact that as far as Franco has any support left at all in Spain, he has</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">got it amongst the backward hillbillies of the mountains, and he is fighting against the enlightened people of the great cities of Spain. And he is trying to establish in Spain a government like that which Mussolini has established in Italy or that which Hitler has established in Germany. And then Germany and Italy hope, with the help of Spain, to be able to dominate Europe. And after </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">while perhaps they hope that with the assistance of the Fascists of France, because there are Fascists in every country, there are even Fascist influences growing up here in the United States of America, and with the help of Spain and Germany and Italy they are hoping perhaps to dominate the world. The prospect is that the whole of western Europe will be carried over into this Fascist dictatorial type of government, a type of government that makes war the centra! instrument of their policy, and who, if they are allowed to proceed, will ultimately become dominant all over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That was in May, 1937. Czechoslovakia was dismembered March 15, 1939, and the very thing that “Father” O’Flanagan had foreseen had become an accomplished fact. The fight for world control was on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lawrence Fernsworth, a noble and honest Catholic, in a two-column story in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> dated Barcelona, Spain, September 22, 1938 (six months before Franco’s victory), reported a “Father” Rodes as testifying that “the Republican government acts with discretion and tolerance, and as far as I know persecutes no one -for his ideas”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spain’s Consul in Manila</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One wonders how many Americans that lost loved ones at Bataan are aware that Franco’s consul at Manila, Jose del Castano, helped to bring about their death. VThen the time came to betray Manila, Del Castano had 10,000 well-trained assistants. Allan Chase, in his book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Falange,</span><span class="font5"> explains: <sub>(</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wild rumors spread like hurricanes through the city, rumors the character of which had already become familiar in all lands invaded by the Nazis in Europe: MacArthur had fled to Washington. Quezon had gone over to the Japs. The entire American air force had been destroyed. The American Army had received orders to shoot all Catholics and imprison all Filipinos. . . . These rumors were not being spread by obscure Japanese spies; they originated directly from Civilian Emergency Headquarters. ... At three o’clock on the afternoon of January 2, 1942, the Japanese marched into Manila, their military tasks having been lightened a thousandfold by the effective Fifth Column job within the city itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese were in on this entire Roman Catholic conspiracy. This was well known to both Philippine and American officials. After the betrayal had succeeded the Japanese officials graciously sent a formal decoration to Pilar _Primo de Rivera, sister of the founder of the Falange (the Roman Catholic organization that pulled off the job).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a matter of regret that Jose del Castano entered upon his work in Manila with the blessing of the United States department of state. The Japanese regarded him as having rendered them “priceless undercover aid”, and Franco, to prove even to the state department that he has no brains, sent the new quisling administration at Manila (Jose P, Laurel, head) his congratulations on their “mutual understanding”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franco, the Sunday bullfight manager and blesser, may be sexually honest (no information on this) but if he had any brains he would know that the same religious crooks that are so notoriously rotten in his own country are more so in the Philippines. There, when Uncle Sam took over the country, the natives hated and distrusted the priests because of the widespread “Derecho de Pernada” by virtue of which the priest who performed the marriage ceremony claimed as a right to have the bride for the first night himself. Senate Document No. 190, 56th Congress, 2nd Session; Presidential Message, of William 'McKinley, February 25, 1901; Report of Col. C. C. Hood, military governor, April 25, 1900; also Judge (later president) William H. Taft, who cited Roman Catholic Major W. H, Johnston, district inspectorgeneral, and two Roman Catholic chaplains, McKinnon and Fitzgerald, as agreeing substantially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ruined by Prosperity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the sixteenth century the “Church” in Spain was flooded with the wealth of. the Aztecs and Incas and the archbishop of Toledo alone had an income of $1,200,000 a year. The Moors, the artisans of the country, were expelled, and in the seventeenth century the population dropped from 30,000,000 to less than 7,000,000. The morals became atrocious. Then came the Inquisition, the murder department of the “Church”. The ecclesiastics became richer and richer, and the'common people sank into ever deeper ignorance, poverty and superstition, for two solid centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the twentieth century the church was spending $7,500,000 a year for candles and incense, and a Catholic bishop estimated that the monks and nuns alone had two-thirds of the wealth of the country and one-third of the landed property; beggars were everywhere. When the workers went on strike as at Oviedo, in 1934, Franco, the super-murderer, crushed them with such brutality that mankind recoiled in horror. The common people -of Spain, .the intelligent people of Spain, formed a republic, so that all together the country might be well-fed, well-clothed, well-housed, and well-educated. There is nothing Franco and the “Church” dread more than such an idea. So the rich landowners, industrialists, financiers, militarists and religionists put Butcher Franco on the job, knowing that his ruthlessness and brutality could be counted bn. They won. The army was officered 'by men trained in Jesuit schools, and when General von Ludendorff said that the Jesuits and Mussolini would profit most by Franco’s victory, the magazine in which he made the statement was confiscated (in January, 1937).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the war began, the famous truth-telling George Seldes (now editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact)</span><span class="font5"> remarked that whatever material damage had been done to the church was the work of individuals and mobs, and noted that in all countries where the press is in Fascist hands not a truthful word about Spain ever appeared after the war began. The Jesuits had everything sewed up tight, and concealed the fact that the churches were used by Franco as munitions depots and fortresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fernsworth’s Courageous Statement</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lawrence A. Fernsworth, a Catholic, Spanish correspondent pf the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> and of the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> is an honest man. In the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholics Speak for Spain,</span><span class="font5"> after explaining that in Spain the church had constituted a heavy drain upon the economic resources of the country and had become topheavy with clergy, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And- how many times have I walked into some cathedral to find a solemn or a pontifical mass being celebrated in all. liturgical pomp with the assistance of the entire cathedra! chapter and in the presence of only three or four of the faithful! The people had their chief contacts with the church for funerals, masses and dispensations. They arrived at the conclusion that the church was a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">negocio,</span><span class="font3"> a business. Some of the clergy lived scandalous lives. Too many of them were accused of attempting to dominate the households with which they had contact, of setting themselves up as bosses in the villages, and of much more. In consequence the clergy came to lose the respeet of great scores of the population; if not, indeed, of a majority of Spanish Catholics. Hundreds of thousands were completely driven away from the church,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same booklet reminds the reader that the pope blessed a rebellion against a legitimate government, and ■ that priests fired on soldiers of that government from the church towers in Madrid. But there were some truly honest and truly patriotic priests in Madrid at that very time, one of them the “Reverend Father” Leocadio Lobo, who broadcast over the Madrid radio that the Spanish Catholic Republicans were not a mob, not riffraff, not a rabble, but were merely citizens demanding social justice and t^e lessening of the infinite gulfs between those who have all and those who have nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franco is too big a lunkhead to understand such a reasonable wish, and yet he knows perfectly well that when King Alfonso himself proposed a national election, and offered to abdicate if the election went against him and for a republic, in the city of Madrid itself the majority for the republic was more than twelve to one. That is why the babying of Franco by Britain, France and the United States is so indefensible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Executions to Music</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One sometimes wonders if Franco and the Hierarchy really forget everything, and think the people do also. Who could forget the executions of a fourth of the citizens of Teruel when Franco’s armies seized the place, or that the executions took place in the plaza, with bands playing and crowds applauding and dancing ? That is religion all right, but is it Christianity? Cardinal Goma showed what he is when he said that the only peace that could be made with his fellow Spanish Catholic Republicans must be “that made with arms”. Since he might become a pope at any time, how does that stack up with Pacelli’s constant holler that he is 'ever working for peace and dying for peace’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pius XI (for ever dead) and Pius XII (headed for the same everlasting annihilation) both refused an audience when the Basque Catholics (the pick of all Spain) requested a hearing six months before Franco committed his treason. In the conquest of Guipuzcoa Franco’s officers put to death fourteen priests that were trying to be loyal to the Spanish Catholic Republic. Both these popes were back of Franco’s appeal to the Catholic hierarchies of the world to back him in his fight in their behalf. This appeal was published in 36 editions and in 14 languages,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J. M. Martinez, N.D., Miami, Florida, comes from a Catholic family that gave a cardinal to the “Church”, He bears testimony in the Miami </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font5"> that the churches were used as ammunition centers and machine-gun nests; that the Catholic Church in Spain conspired against the legitimate government; that the working people had suffered under its tyrannies until they felt that they must have a republic, but that when they did have such a government, and sought diplomatic relations with the Vatican, they were rebuked at every turn, but the Japanese and Hitler and his crowd had better luck. He says truthfully and bitingly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If this war is being fought against Fascism everywhere as our president and other democratic leaders have assured us several times, . then the Catholic boys who are dying in the southwestern Pacific and in North America are fighting the same battle and the same enemies the Loyalists fought. They are fighting Hitler, Mussolini and Franco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With Machiavellian hypocrisy, the Vatican, after conspiring successfully for the destruction of the Spanish Catholic Republic, then required all Spanish bishops to “swear and promise to respect and make my clergy respect the chief of the Spanish state and the government established according to Spanish laws”. Had they done that early in the year 1936 there would never have been a Spanish Civil War and their hands would have been freed from the stain of a million murdered Spanish Catholics and another million destroyed with even greater cruelty, many of them starved to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Clearly a &quot;Church'’</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> H'ar</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All who are interested in what has been taking place in Spain in the last few years should read the article “The Jesuit-Fascist Revolt in Spain”, October 7, 1936, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font5">(now </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation).</span><span class="font5"> Therein is the proof that the Spanish Catholic Republic was inspired by ideals so much higher than those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that there is no possible comparison. It treated its enemies with manhood, with leniency, with justice, and with honesty. It provided for education, for civil marriages, for lay cemeteries. The author of that article personally heard the secretary of the Roman Catholic bishop in Madrid say of the “Church’s” efforts to besmirch and demean the people’s own government: “We’ve lost all along the front; there’s only one thing left for us to do: bring about clashes in the streets” (so as to give the government a bad name and extract sympathy for the Hierarchy), '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It makes one’s blood run cold to reread that article and see once again what kind of man Franco really is. Imagine the wives and children of prisoners being used to protect his artillery by being concentrated on the flat roofs of the barracks at Cerro Muriano; imagine thirteen youths at Alcubierre lashed together by tijeir elbows, sprayed with gasoline and then set afire; imagine, at Palma del Condado, his soldiers bombing in prison the leaders of the republican parties and workmen’s societies and shooting any who wept at what they saw done to these noble men. And there were other cases of where women and children were tied spread-eagle fashion in the windows and Franco’s Moors and other rebels firing from behind them. All this had the church’s “blessing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the war Franco said that his soldiers, the Moslem Moors, were fighting for a victory which “will ‘progress along the lines of a totalitarian state” and that the Spanish people would have no voice in their form of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was his Moorish soldiers that were the first to enter the great city of Barcelona, and as soon as the war was over, and the Asturian miners in the north of Spain went on strike he recalled the Moors to go north once more and fight his battles all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How Franco Got Soldiers and Arms</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Granada—-but let </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New Age, </span><span class="font5">a Masonic paper, tell it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The military forces were marched outside - the city, and assembled, ostensibly for drill or parade. There the officers told them that there had been a change of government in the country, a statement wholly false. Squads of men were then sent into the city, under command of officers who were in the plot, with lists of city officials, judges, and others, including members of the Masonic Fraternity, who were arrested and in many instances executed. Methods such as these were generally used, and enabled the rebels to gain control of a large part of the military forces of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In anticipation of the coming Jesuit war for control of the world, Hitler and Mussolini had great piles of ammunition ready for the fray, and when Chamberlain returned from Munich with only his umbrella left to show for it, they freely armed Franco, that being the “Church’s” wish, and their own wish also, for all three are sons of the same “harlot”. —Revelation, chapter 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hierarchy got on the job in Ireland, squeezed $500,000 out of the poor Irish people, and sent General Owen O’Buffy with 1,400 Irish lads into Spain to help fight Franco’s battles. These sickened of the job in four months and returned to Ireland. They could see that the Spanish war was between the “Church” and Moors on the one side and the honest Spanish Catholic people on the other, and, to their credit, they backed out and went home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To cultivate the impression that they were being persecuted or killed, the priests, and nuns in Loyalist territory dressed in the clothing of the common people. When the Loyalist government announced that religious services might be resumed, the pope was sore and announced that any masses said by priests on the Loyalist side were “unauthorized”. As a matter of fact every mass is a blasphemy, and so all of them are unauthorized; but that wasn’t what the pope meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Why the Bishops Back Franco”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You should read the article by that name published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> for December 29, 1937. Therein John McGovern, Roman Catholic member of Parliament for Glasgow, Scotland, told of his 6,000-mile trip in Spain. He had pictures of children mutilated by Franco’s bombers while playing in the streets; of mothers machine-gunned and bombed while waiting for their daily rations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Said McGovern:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These evil deeds are backed by bishops and priests in Spain, I have indisputable evidence. Here is a photograph of a'gun taken from a Moor, and on the gun is fixed the badge of the Sacred Heart. Here is a bag taken from a Moor. On it are inscribed pictures of the Sacred Host. Could religion be prostituted further? A bishop addresses the Moorish troops near Burgos and, blessing them, says: “You will have a special place in Paradise for your part in this struggle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After showing that the “Church” owned almost everything in Spain, and giving a wealth of the most startling information on the subject, this courageous Catholic said of the ecclesiastics:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “Church” paid the peasants 2 pesetas a day, or 5s. a week in our money. I went to many peasants and often their families had never been able to buy meat. I met a man who had not eaten flesh for five years. I saw the children. The story of their poverty was written, tragic and stark, in their faces and physical bearing. I saw grown men who had a new suit </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font3"> clothes for their weddings, and fifteen to twenty years after they were wearing the same suit of clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. McGovern quoted Don Angel</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ossorio y Gallardo, one of the most prominent Catholic and Conservative lawyers of Spain, as protesting the “Church” war waged against the Spanish Catholic people, and as using this moving statement: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Christian ought not to suffer the name of God to be used to attack a legitimately constituted state,' for if he does so he forgets the command, ‘.Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s.’ A Catholic owes respect and obedience to the Church, but to the Church as the immortal depository of the highest, purest, most generous doctrine that the centuries have heard—not to be confused with the ecclesiastical degeneration of jewel-laden bishops who drag God into political conflicts and ask His intervention to defeat the Left in elections, thereby lowering God to the level of a combatant, blaspheming his divinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“A Splendid School of War”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">General von Reichenau, referring to the vicious and indefensible course of Hitler, Mussolini and Franco in Spain, said that “the Spanish war has been a splendid school of war”. That was early in 1938, and Hitler started the European war March 15, 1939, when he invaded Czechoslovakia. It surely was a great school. The moment Franco seized a town, if the people did not publicly and immediately acknowledge him as their conqueror, they were forthwith executed or imprisoned. It is a funny thing that Spellman doesn’t know anything about these well-known facts to which he was a contributing factor. Does he think bluffs have an eternal effect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be sure, the moment Franco won the war he began to toady to the big religionists. He even .gave them free postage. And the 11 ierarchy, insolent and cruel before, became immediately even more cruel than it was before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The story ends with an address by Edmond L. Taylor, president of the Anglo-American Press Association, given in Paris, at the American Club, before the city capitulated to the Germans. You might like to read it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am not a Socialist, I am not a liberal, I do not know exactly what I am, but 1 do know that I am neither indignant nor surprised when 1 am referred to as a fascist. And it also happens that I am a Catholic, not very faithful, but Catholic just the same. There is no personal antipathy between me and the rebels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nevertheless I think that the soldiers of Franco are nothing but wild beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These people act like ferocious animals and at the same time appeal to the whole world, posing as champions of western civilization. What I detest,-what all journalists detest, are tendentious speeches, hypocrisy and lying propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Spanish fascists play but a small role in the actual battles, but they voluntarily carry on police work and executions behind the lines. At Talavera for a long time they had a woman executioner, the wife of one of their own number. She had no official position; they simply authorized her to execute prisoners, as a favor to her because she liked to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Spanish Foreign Legionnaires and the Moors are different. They are professionals. But they too have their own pet notions. I have never been able to understand why they took the trouble to tie the hands of seven republicans whom they captured near Toledo, and to tie them together with one rope before shooting them. I saw the same thing on the outskirts of Toledo—24 bodies, this time tied together with one rope. One of the bodies was headless; I suppose that a Moor did that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Toledo I saw, behind the Alcazar, in a hole caused by a mine, fifty republican corpses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The official explanation was that these corpses, brought from the field of battle, had been placed there for. sanitary reasons. I noticed that all these bodies were placed face down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is difficult to explain, unless you can suggest that these were prisoners whom they made stand on the edge of the mine-hole right under the walls of the Alcazar so that the heroic defenders could enjoy the spec taele and shoot them down, in the back, peacefully, one by one. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And yet Franco is not through with Spanish democracy. Agitation for a Spanish republican government-in-exile is being heard. A dispatch from Tunisia revealed that Spanish republican troops were then fighting with the Allies. They had previously fought in the Spanish Civil War, and, when defeated by Franco’s Moors, Nazis and Fascists, made their way to North Africa. French authorities interned them, but they were released when Eisenhower took over. Now they are wearing British uniforms, fighting alongside the British, American and French forces. And Franco waits, with his fingers crossed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pope’s Peace Plan </span><span class="font3">(From a Catholic’s viewpoint)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">«pATHOLIC Veterans Support</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pope’s Peace Plan,” was a headline in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> July 1944. Why “Catholic” veterans? Why not American veterans, and, above all, why not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font5"> Americans and give due support and loyalty to the president as leader and also to our country, never mind the pope or any other foreign king, prince, or potentate? Americans, and that means everybody from Roman Catholics, Protestants and Jews to atheists, owe allegiance to the United States and the Constitution, which forbids any form of state religion. I, as one of the Roman Catholic faith, object to the contamination of my religious faith with politics, either by the pope or by the laity. No other church meddles in politics in such a flagrant way as does the Roman Catholic church. It is unAmerican and, above all, it is in opposition to Christian ideology. To make religion a matter of politics is blasphemous hypocrisy as well as heresy, regardless of the pope’s so-called “infallibility”, which is a myth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By their mention of “Catholic” veterans they further implicate that church in an effort to thwart justice and punishment of those sadistic paranoiacs who created this war. If “Protestant” veterans took part in a movement upholding the full penalties of unconditional surrender and total defeat of the axis, these “Catholic” veterans and the clergy would accuse Protestants of meddling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just what is this “Catholic veterans” movement? Is it another Coughlinite move, Christian Front, America First, and that lot who use that slogan to hide their own deceit, to cover the subversive activities in which they engage? Why do these “Catholic veterans” place the pope ahead of the president of the United States in this matter? Who is the pope these people set up as a man-god, infallible and appointed by some mystical power to rule over the nations of ■ the woild and who holds the keys of the kingdom of heaven? He is the political head of the political state of Vatican City, regardless of its small size, who was appointed in true fascist political fashion by a packed court, Italian-controlled, who see to it that only an Italian shall rule as pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pope seeks a “reasonable peace”, no victors, no vanquished, a negotiated peace where those to whom he and his predecessor gave full support, Mussolini and Hitler (in exchange for a mess of pottage, restored temporal power) will be let dowm easily. Like the man who bet on the wrong horse, he now sees it losing, wants all the bets called off and declared “no race”. That wmuld suit Hitler, but not the United Nations, nor those Catholics in Poland and Czechoslovakia whose homes were destroyed and their families wiped out by those whom the pope had sent his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why didn’t the pope do something about the peace then? Why should he when those he supported were winning? Why didn’t he do something about it when Italian as well as German bombs were dropping on those sacred edifices in England? (Canterbury, St. Margaret’s, Coventry, Westminster Abbey, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">others) They were as sacred as any of those in Rome, including the Vatican, and were ancient when St. Peter’s and the Vatican were in swaddling clothes, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">having </span><span class="font5">been built centuries before either </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">those structures was erected. It is the pope who is unreasonable; his peace plan belated; his sympathies one-sided. Out of common decency and gratitude, he should be all out on the side of the United Nations for the only reasonable peace terms that could be offered, the unconditional surrender and total (not partial) defeat of the Axis. These terms are more than generous. What terms would Hitler have imposed if he had won? We know, and the pope would have nothing to say about it, for he too would be under the domination of Hitler. And we know where we in this country would now be if Britain had sold out as Petain did with France. With those Coughlin-ites, Christian Fronters, ‘‘Catholic Veterans,” isolationists, anti-1 end-leasers, who still aid and abet Hitler by their activities knowingly or not, Hitler would not need invade this country. His stooges would save him that expense and trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why did President Roosevelt risk his life to visit Hawaii? Was it for a pleasant sea voyage for his health? Why did he reiterate unconditional surrender and total defeat of the Axis? Why did Mr. Churchill risk his life to visit France and Italy? Was that also a week-end trip to the Riviera for pleasure? Who is more qualified to know what the terms should be, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and those fighting this sadistic enemy, or the pope? He now seeks negotiated peace to thwart the only justified terms possible. He is opposed to those efforts, and these “Catholic Veterans” follow the leadership of the pope rather than the president This attitude further implicates the pope and the church with the desire to obtain a negotiated peace, which Hitler would accept any time, now that he sees defeat. We could Jiave obtained that kind of peace long ago, if we dared to lie down to Hitler. The only language those sadistic madmen understand is their own. But we have not dropped to their beastly level. The Mosaic law would be fully justified in dealing with them. And the pope continues to do. business with them. But there are some Catholics who dare express their disgust at such political blunderings and diplomacy. The pope is not above criticism for the political con-.niving he and his predecessor have indulged in, all for the political aggrandizement of the Vatican state, not for the spiritual things or the cause of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The attitude of the pope toward our great ally, the Soviet Union, is disgusting. While he supports Nazism and Fascism and seeks to destroy the Soviet Union, he should know the Soviet Union is not Roman Catholic and it is none of his business what form of government that or any other country operates under. But he does meddle in politics there, in a manner he would not dare to in Britain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Stalin were to ban the Roman Catholic church from the Soviet Union for its subversive activities, he would be fully justified. But the pope would make a deal any time if it suited his purpose and would accept Communism, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin as readily as he accepted Mussolini, Hitler, Franco, Petain, Fascism and Nazism. To make any kind of deal in exchange for the political aggrandizement of the Vatican state is the same as making a pact with the Devil, if it suited the pope’s purpose. It would be unethical, but what do politicians care about ethics? Furthermore, what can we expect from those who espoused and made these deals with Mussolini, Hitler, Franco, Hirohito, and that lot?,Yet Ratti accepted Mussolini, and by so doing placed this Fascist yoke around his neck. It holds the church in its grip, and until the present pope casts off that yoke he associates with the enemies of God and .man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We owe no loyalty to the pope or any other foreign potentate. Americans do owe allegiance to their country and their constitution, which recognizes no state church or religion. That is as it should be. No canon law of any church takes precedence. Let “Catholic Veterans” remember that. They owe that loyalty to the president and those who seek to make the sadistic and paranoiac Nazis pay for the damage they have done. Any negotiated peace with the enemies of God and man would be a mockery of justice and this much- abused “Christian charity” of which the pope speaks. “Forgive them, for they know not what they do” does not apply to these murderers. They do know what they do. Their creed that it is more glorious to die for their cause than it is to live, that kindness and mercy are signs of weakness, that they are the only ones fit to rule the world, shows they know. The Mosaic law would surely punish such a beastly enemy. But we have not reached the stage of the mad beasts tfe are at war against. Yet this is the new order of popes Pius XI and XII and to which they gave their support. Can that be denied? Can the pope say he did not know whom he was dealing with when he sent his blessings upon Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco? Can he say blessing Franco as the 'Savior of Christianity’ was inspired of God? It was a blasphemous epithet, coming from the political lead of a political state whom we Catholics are taught to adore as the Vicar of Christ. More blasphemy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is about time Catholics understood the difference between Christianity and the political corruption of this church by its political hierarchy. Roman Catholicism is not Christianity any more than the Democratic party is democracy. Yet this church claims to be the only true faith founded by our Lord and claims the sole right to call itself Christian. AU others are called spurious imitations. It would be just too bad for all those outside the pale of Rome if that were true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano</span><span class="font5"> recently said, “The Catholic Church is alien to Communism.” But it is not alien to Fascism and Nazism. We know that. Again, “Catholics oppose Communism.” Well, does not the Catholic church oppose Protestantism and all those Catholic faiths which are not under the 'domination of the pope ? It opposes everything that does not bear the stamp of approval of the pope. It opposes Protestant missionaries from those countries where it rules like the gangster over jurisdiction which it claims full right to control, but demands the right to invade all other territory. It pleads for tolerance but is scant when it comes to showing it toward others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for these “Catholic Veterans”, it is too bad one of those flying bombs ■ could not have been dropped on that convention to give them a mild dose of what the people of Britain get every hour, day and night. What if they had had their families wiped out and their homes destroyed, like those Catholics in Poland and Czechoslovakia? That would probably change their opinion and their support of the pope’s peace plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These “Catholic Veterans” must remember these victims of the sadistic Nazi maniacs are entitled to justice. Never mind the pope and those whom he favors. Such a negotiated peace would be adding insult to injury. Mussolini and Hitler, have been appeased too much, and any further appeasement would prove that we are weak (in the head). The only way to treat them is by their own methods. When one destroys a plague one exterminates all the bacteria, not part of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the pope wants Fascism and Nazism to be allowed to live. He still hangs on to the yoke which was placed around his neck and which holds him in its grip and will strangle him as it did others. Yet he supports this beast that was spawned in the gutters of Rome long before we ever heard of Mussolini, Hitler and this “blessed savior” Franco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Church has been ruled by this fascist dictatorship, and an &quot;infallible” head, for centuries. The pope is Vicar of Christ, appointed by Him. Isn’t that what we Catholic simps are told to believe? Well, the emperor of Japan goes us one better. He is the direct son of the sun god. Some Japs believe that one. The emperor too is an “infallible” one. Fear, superstition and ignorance, the magic powder of relics, miraculous medals, charms, statues, indulgences and dispensations are great methods of aiding priestcraft in keeping the simple-minded in submission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And w<sup>T</sup>ho are the big leaders in this Fascist-Nazi scheme? Catholics! among them Knights of St. Gregory and other papal-decorated ones. They are headed by Ratti and Pacelli. Hitler, Von Papen, Goebbels, Himmler, and all that lot, are Catholics. Fine pals for Pacelli and a credit to the Roman Catholic Church, eh?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now the pope seeks to have the Italians freed from paying any indemnities; that they be taken in as partners, in with the United Nations. That would leave them exempt from the consequences of their own acts. That would • be fine and also very generous and would please the pope. Of course, if we must ?unish Hitler and his lot “please let poor taly alone”. After all, the pope is an Italian and he wants the Italians spared from penalties they deserve as well as the Germans, Rumanians, Bulgarians and all the Axis group, including Japan. Also those archtraitors, Quisling, Petain, Laval, Franco. In the face of these Judas Iscariot and Benedict Arnold can now rest in peace. In fact, they could be canonized as “saints”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If things had been going favorably for Mussolini, these same Italians would still be shouting “Viva il Duce!” as the Germans “Heil Hitler!” And how about the way they inflicted death, destruction and starvation on Greece? &quot;Muss/’ cried for Hitler to save him, otherwise the ‘weak little Greeks’ would have knocked Italy out of the war before we did. Italy’s troops still fight against us; unlike Rumania, which turned the war against Hitler and came to the side of the United Nations in spite of Rumania’s Nazi-inspired war against the Soviet Union. That way the position of Rumania is different from that of Italy, which we had to invade and defeat. Italy must be made to pay for her own acts, as bloody as those of Germany. The records prove that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Mr. Churchill visited Rome, did he need any advice from the pope? If that is so, then we can expect more appeasement, which would be as much a sign of weakness as it was to continue the house of Savoy instead of dealing <sub>(</sub>with the democratic groups in Italy ' whom the pope has always opposed in every country where any attempt has been made to remove the pope and church as a political power. It was for that reason that Pius IX went into exile, the prisoner of the Vatican (like going on a hunger strike). And it was the blessed Mussolini who &quot;freed” Pius XI by hjs Fascist bribe of restored political power. The present pope wears the fascist scapular round his neck, next to his skin, as he asks for a negotiated peace and immunity for Italy; to h...........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">with Germany and his Nazi pals. Let them pay if they must. That is the attitude of the pope in plain language, as he sees the horse on which he placed his bets out of the race, and wants the bets called off. The only decent thing the pope can do is to cast off the Fascist yoke even if it costs him that temporal power, the bribe of Mussolini which he received in exchange for his soul, like the bribe of Mephistopheles to Faust. —J.....-.....R----, Rhode Island.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">N</span><span class="font5">OAH is greatly honored in God’s Word. Besides the original story recorded at such length in Genesis chapters 5 to 10 inclusive, the prophet Isaiah is caused to refer to him as one of Jehovah’s dear friends.

For thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called. For Jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, saith thy God. For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting lovingkindness will 1 have mercy on thee, saith Jehovah thy Redeemer.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee. —Isaiah 54:1-10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Another Prophet Mentions Him Twice</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet Ezekiel also mentions Noah twice, and couples his name with two others whose cheerful and faithful endurance for righteousness have greatly magnified Jehovah’s name. All three of these will be back here shortly, and won’t they be interested if some day they read this paragraph in the American Standard Version:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast; though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah. If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts; though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate. Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast; though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves. Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast; though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.—Ezekiel 14:12-20,* Am, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“That” Prophet Mentions Him Twice</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest of all prophets, “that” prophet, Christ Jesus, the Son of the Most High God, also mentions him twice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of man. They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah entered the ark, and the deluge came, and destroyed them all.—Luke 17:26, 27, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The one that God chose to use both keys, to open the privileges of the kingdom of heaven first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles, also mentions him twice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For it is better, if the will of God permit, to suffer for doing good, than for doing evil. Because Christ even once suffered on account of sins—the righteous for the unrighteous,— that he might lead us to God, being indeed put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the spirit; by which also he preached to the spirits in prison, who formerly disobeyed, when the patience of God was waiting in the days of Noah, while an ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were carried safely through the water. And immersion, a representation of this, now saves us.—1 Peter 3; 17-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but having confined them in Tartarus with chains of thick darkness, delivered them over into custody for judgment; and did not spare the old world, but kept in safety Noah, the eighth, a herald of righteousness, bringing a deluge on a world of impious men. —2 Peter 2:4, 5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Arid finally the one that meekly said of himself, “I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God,” gives him a worthy place in the chapter in which he names by name some of those that during the preceding four thousand years had won divine approval:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In faith Noah, having been divinely admonished concerning things not then seen, moved with pious fear, built an ark for the preservation of his family; through which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness according to faith. —Hebrews 11:7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Glance at His Ancestors</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No living person is without interest in the ten common ancestors of all human creatures now upon earth: Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech and Noah. Three of these, Enoch, Lamech and Noah, seem to have been praiseworthy, and though Methuselah died in the year of the flood, yet the fact that his days were lengthened to 969 years may mean that he made a worthy link between the other three. In any event Enoch was a prophet of Jehovah “and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him”. (Genesis 5:24) As for Lamech, all the readers of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font5"> were greatly blessed with the record at pages 128129 herewith reproduced:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lameeh’s name meaning “powerful; overthrower; destroyer”, it fitted in with Enoch’s prophecy that the God of all power would overthrow the power of the ungodly and destroy them and would usher in a new world in which obediynt men would rest from excessive labor and the oppressions of the wicked. Lamech had lived during the last fifty-six years of the life of his first forefather, Adam. From him Lamech learned direct how, due to Adam’s sin, God had cursed the earth, but had also given promise of the coming of the “seed” that should bruise the head of the Serpent of deception and untruth. That would mean the lifting of the ciirse. Lamech hoped. “And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, which cometh because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.” (Genesis 5:28, 29, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. S.</span><span class="font3"> V.) Lameeh’s words proved to be a prophecy, and were therefore inspired by the spirit or invisible force of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the concordance in the Watchtower edition of the American Standard Version it is explained that the name Noah means rest or consolation, and so, in a way, this magazine bears his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Consider the Conditions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The book from which the last quotation was made goes at some length into the conditions that existed during the later years of Lamech’s life. They were horrible in the extreme. In a nutshell they may be described as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.—Genesis 6:5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. S.</span><span class="font3"> V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.—Genesis 6:12, Am. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.—Genesis 6:11, Am. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was also a laxity of desire to know the truth, to face it, and to live in accordance with it. There was a willing and intentional ignorance of the Creator by the populace; they</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">knew not until the flood came, and took them all away.—Matthew 24: 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over and above all this, there were in the earth the gigantic Nephilim, the demons, materialized in the flesh, who, to the extent of their ability, must have been persecutors of Lantech and Noah. Then there were the “sons of God”, the lesser angels, who were induced by the Nephilim to marry “the daughters of men”, and who did so, and whose children, Gibborim, fleshly creatures with superior vitality, unauthorized by God, are in the traditions of every ancient people. In short, the whole world was a seething mass of corruption and is summed up in the Scriptures as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose. And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years. The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.—Genesis 6:1-4, Am. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Noah Gets His Assignment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sub>t</sub> After the Scriptures set forth these horrid conditions, they state, “But Noah fqund favor in the eyes of Jehovah,” “Noah was a righteous man, and blameless </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[margin]</span><span class="font5"> in his generations: Noah walked with God.” (Genesis 6: 8, 9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> At this time, before the flood, Noah was at least 480 years old, and childless. He may not even have been married. Now notice what he was sub^ sequently asked to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a world in which it had never rained, this man, over five centuries old, was asked to build a seaworthy structure three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high. Man has a natural measuring system in his own body. The ancient cubit was from elbow to finger tip, was not less than one and one-half feet, and so the ark was at least 450 feet long, or longer than the magnificent block-long Memorial Auditorium used at the Buffalo convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don’t get the idea that they did not have mechanics in those days; for they did. The text and footnote of Genesis 4: 22, in the American Standard Version, names “Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer of every cutting instrument of copper and iron”. What this man knew about the art of tempering copper, he failed to write down, and the smart alecks of the twentieth century are still trying to find out how he did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Noah Obeyed Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Obviously, Noah built the ark. The ground floor occupied close to 33,750 square feet of floor space, and there were three floors. As there were three stories, it was possible to store the hay and other provisions on the top floors, while on the bottom floor there was plenty of room so that the elephants could swing their trunks ad libitum and the giraffes could walk around without bumping their heads. The floors were possibly fifteen feet apart. Ventilation was provided. Jehovah was the designer. Noah was the contractor. And if he had not obeyed instructions possibly not one of us would be in existence today. He was told to build the structure of cypress (gopher), which is light and strong, and durable, and good for water-borne structures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can you imagine any greater test of endurance than Noah faced, when at over five hundred years of age he received his instructions to build the ark? It is certain that all about him was the worst kind of corruption. Superior creatures from the spirit world were running rampant. Human society was disorganized. But he wanted to do God's will. And he did it. He was a “herald of righteousness”, but he was more. Except he had built that ark there would have been no flesh saved, not even himself. You can picture what kind of reception* he got when he proclaimed God’s purpose to destroy all flesh, except those that should come into the ark which he was to build, and which he built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God was “long-suffering” in those days wherein the ark was in building, and he is long-suffering now when Armageddon impends, and when the message is repeated that, except for those in God’s organization (and which the ark represented), “everything that is in the earth shall die.”—Genesis 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But don’t you think that Noah felt repaid when “Jehovah said unto Noah, Cbme thou and all thy house into, the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation”? (Genesis 7:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> And wasn’t he repaid when “Jehovah shut him in”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Genesis 7:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ter.)</span><span class="font5"> And wasn’t he repaid when the Gibborim and others began to. hammer at the doors and try to get him to open them and he had to tell them the plain truth, that Jehovah had shut the doors and it was too late? And wasn’t he repaid when “on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened” and “the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth” and he knew that Jehovah had blessed his faith, his obedience, his workmanship, and his managerial ability?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And wasn’t he blessed in the busy year which he and his family had in caring for all the varieties of animals he had in his floating zoo ? And wasn’t he blessed when the year was up and the dry land appeared? And won’t he be glad to tell, shortly, how happy he was when he and his loved ones stepped out of the ark and he was able to let the animals go their ways while he built an altar to worship his God and his Deliverer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And didn’t he get a blessing when God hung before him that beautiful rainbow, which none on earth had ever seen before that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And, in the sunset of his life (for he lived down to within two years of the birth of Abraham, and Shem lived down until Isaac was fifty years old and may have been the Melchisedec to whom Abraham gave tithes), don’t you suppose he was glad to tell what Lamech had told him about the early history of humanity, and in which he himself played so conspicuous a part?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Noah was a grand example of constant, cheerful endurance; he was an energetic, capable contractor and builder, and, best of all, he “walked with God” and was all his days “a herald of righteousness” (2 Peter 2:5, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott),</span><span class="font5"> a proclaimer of Jehovah’s kingdom in which he will soon have a blessed part, as a visible representative thereof on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font5">N THE street corner I announced, “Latest issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?” 'T should say not;</span><span class="font5"> I know of many towns where they won’t allow you people on the street corners.” This remark came from a man who approached suddenly, and then quickly disappeared. His own words were a judgment against him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few moments later a well-dressed gentleman approached me and asked for the name of the leader of our organization. “Jehovah God,” was my answer. “But I mean your local leader.” “We have no local leaders,” I replied. “Well, who is your chairman?” As he was pleasant I gave him the name of the company servant. I asked him his name, which he gave readily, and also the town </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">is from. He then said that he was running for state representative in the legislature. I told him that Jehovah’s witnesses were not interested in politics. He said that he knew that, and that he did not believe in politics in the churches or the schools; that he had knowledge of the persecution that Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font5">received; that he knew of one instance in his home county (Stark) of a mayor who gave Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">unjust </span><span class="font5">treatment; that he knew this mayor personally, and went to him and reprimanded him for his illegal actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I then told him of some cases decided against ns by the U. S. Supreme Court, and that these decisions were later reversed. He was aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Proceeding, the gentleman explained that he was a member of a committee that had revised the criminal code of the Ohio laws, and that he thought that there ought to be a law enacted in Ohio protecting Jehovah’s witnesses’ legal rights in accordance with the legal decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. He knows where we meet. He made sure he had the servant’s name correct, and then departed with the intention of seeing him later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is one more experience convincing of the fact that God’s truth is separating the &quot;sheep” from the “goats”.

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Bishop Forgot His Manners</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">N May the Father directed us to a mother of ten children who had been a Catholic. She related to us that before moving to our territory she had procured some Watchtower literature (books and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation).</span><span class="font5"> The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> made her very angry, but then she took the Bible and proved to herself that it was true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The priest came and she was too hot a number for him; so he sends the bishop. When he arrived she began quoting Scripture, and asking him to explain, then read Revelation 13:18 (&quot;Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six”). He said it was sacrilegious for her to ask such questions; that she was already damned, and that he would soon take those children away from her and educate them as they should be educated. By this time he was very angry, gritted his teeth, became very red and shook his fist in her face. At this point she ordered him out and told him not to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had a book study with her, and then answered questions for two hours, after which she said this is the only thing that she could put together and have it come out as common sense. Before leaving I asked permission to come Sunday and have a book study in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> book, which she has read. She gladly agreed. Sunday we were there at 11 a.m., and seldom have I seen such well-mannered and obedient children. What a pleasure we had teaching those children how to use the Bible, and what a privilege it was, after the study was over, to join in prayer to Jehovah, asking His protection over those children. She invited us to dinner. We accepted the invitation and were urged to return next Sunday, which we will do.—Charles W. Taylor, Washington.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Liguori on Morals</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">N HIS book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Roman Catholic</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Church in Italy,</span><span class="font5"> published in London by Morgan &amp;&nbsp;Scott, Alexander Robertson, D.D., Venice, discusses briefly the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theoloyia Moralis</span><span class="font5"> Of Alfonso Maria de Liguori, which is the standard one on morals in the Roman Catholic Church. Concerning sins, he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Liguori divides them into mortal, which Missolve friendship with God and merit eternal punishment; and venial, which'only “bring on the soul an easily curable weakness and easily obtain pardon”. And then he goes on to show how all mortal sins can become venial, and asserts “that a Christian does not sin gravely who proposes to commit every one of the venial sins”. Advancing one step farther, he shows how Roman Catholics can steal and cheat, and commit adultery and perjure themselves, even kill, with impunity. Thus, he says that one who steals to relieve real need does not sin, for he from whom he stole was bound in charity to relieve his needs. When one is asked in a court of justice, “Did you see this deed committed ?” he can answer, “I say no,” which will be accepted by the judge as a denial, but by which the witness means “I say the word no”. If a woman is charged by her husband with having committed adultery with her confessor, she can deny it; for, having obtained absolution, it is the same as if she had not committed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The theologian Debcyne, who is the great commentator on the works of Liguori, in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Moechialogie,</span><span class="font3"> Brussels, 1858, page 346, and following pages, gives instruction to the priests how to procure abortion in girls whom they may have seduced. Indeed, Liguori does not hesitate openly to advocate laxity of morals on the ground that by making religion easy the Roman Catholic Church wall gain adherents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then a large part' of the book is taken up with the marriage relation and with the intercourse of the sexes. And in dealing with this subject his descriptions and insinuations and suggestions and questions are so obscene that anyone daring to publish them would certainly be prosecuted for outraging publie decency. In 1894, Professor Grassman, a German, published a translation of it in German, at Stettin. He was immediately apprehended, and although his translation was proved in court to be in every particular absolutely correct, he was condemned. [The same results have followed similar attempts in Italy, Britain, and the United States.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Father Chiniquy, who was for over a quarter of a century a confessor, says: “I have he'ard the confessions of more than two hundred priests, and to say the truth, as God knows it, 1 must declare that only twenty-one had not to weep over the secret or public sins committed through the irresistibly corrupting influences of auricular confession.” “I am now,” he continues, “seventy-six years old, and in a short time I shall be in my grave. I shall have to give an account of what I now say. Well, it is in the presence of my great Judge, with my tomb before my eyes, that I declare to the world that very few— yes, very few—priests escape from falling into the pit of the. most horrible depravity the world has ever known through the confession of females.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HE religionists who intend to build up through the nations of this earth a better “new world order” have had the opportunity of hearing the sayings of Christ Jesus, but they have done them not.

(Matthew 7: 26) When the rainsdescend and the floods come, and the winds blow and beat upon the house that the Devil’s organization has builded up, and it falls, great shall be the fall of it. The battle of the great day of God Almighty will bring about the collapse of the Devil’s organization because its whole structure is</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">built up on lies, the first lie being perpetrated in the garden of Eden. From then on the whole structure has been built on sand, and that operating up to Noah’s day was washed away in the Flood. The Devil’s reconstructed organization was builded of wood, hay and stubble. While his organization is greater in scope now, it will burn and be destroyed with even greater fury than his world at the time of the Flood. Those who build on truth and righteousness live on a Foundation that cannot be destroyed, but which will last forever; and that is God’s kingdom.—1944 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Arizona for Health</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font5">FTER reading an article </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in Consola-lion</span><span class="font5"> No. 645, June 7, entitled “California’’, I could not suppress a smile. I had just read an article in the Phoenix </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette,</span><span class="font5"> by one of the editors, entitled “Good Afternoon”. The editor was, no doubt, an Arizonan. Arizonans will quickly tell you that &quot;Arizona has what California boasts about’. It seems, according to the editor of “Good Afternoon” (to quote him in substance): “A lady called up and in a plaintive voice began to wail, ‘This (Phoenix) is the deadest town I’ve ever been in; no place of amusement, nothing to do, nd place to go; why, when you go down on the streets at ten o’clock the main street is practically deserted! Now you take Los Angeles; there’s the place, bright lights, amusement parks, theaters, fishing, boating, swimming, night clubs, gay people, gay parties, etc.’ No doubt the editor of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font5"> thought the lady ought to go to bed and simmer down on her blood pressure, because when the lady gave out of breath he remarked to her that she reminded him of the famous words of Mark Twain, ‘Tieaven has the climate, but hell has the people.” The account says, “The lady hung up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Grand State</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Arizona is a grand state; as every inch of terra firma on this terrestrial ball is a witness to the Creator’s glory and majesty. “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof,” The earth was created for man and will be his eternal home. It did not please the great Jehovah God to put all the good things of His creation in any one spot, but He made it all to His glory and praise. Monotony is not known to the man of God, neither can he say that any spot on earth is lonely or dead and in it there is nothing to do. There is always His work! The lady above needed “news” of the Kingdom, and then she would never lack a place to go or a thing to see. Just to be able to live and to work is something for which to be glad. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Arizona is the desert, simple and plain. The sun shines in a peculiarly healing manner that is not equaled anywhere else on earth except in a small spot in Egypt. The health-healing violet rays are more potent here and in Egypt than anywhere else. One cannot help but wonder if that is not why the Lord God picked Egypt to display the wonders of His power in the.most spectacular events in the time of the exodus of His chosen people from that place. The almost unbearable heat does not make one sick or weak, but it brings strength and health and enables creatures with lung trouble, asthma and throat troubles to breathe the minute they arrive on stretchers. These miracles I have seen with my own eyes. It is not like any other method of healing. It will sweat the poison out, and a proper diet and rest will do the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is only one thing wrong in Arizona, and that is, the land is thirsty. It needs drink. A little water does wonders in this country. An example is: I bought a lot last November, not being able to find a house to live in, with all my little family. The lot is right out in the desert. It was so barren in spots, except for goat heads (stickers), that I felt we were getting gypped; but there was nothing else to do. We pitched a tent arid took a chance on the rattlers, scorpions, centipedes,' lizards, Gila monsters, and tarantulas. In the soil also live gophers, termites, field mice, and water roaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some of the Early Blessings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The neighbors were friendly folk; they realized the awful shortage in housing conditions here, because of the abundance of war workers pouring into the state from all over the country. One brought us a lamp, another a piece of linoleum, and others helped out in various ways to make us temporarily comfortable. We finally made two doubledeck full-size beds, which accommodated the eight of us, and today the tent is known as the “Ark of ‘the Desert”. We finally hoisted it over a concrete floor and on studding, and put in electricity and running water, which makes it an ideal camp, with screens and boxing. Neighbors also brought over slips and plain sticks cut from shrubs and trees and flowers. These I planted to please them, hardly to hope that such would grow or form roots in such dirt. If I had not been Kingdom-minded, with a certain faith in Jehovah, I would have thrown the sticks off the trees into the ash can and felt that someone was insulting my intelligence. But you ought to see the sticks now! Faithful watering has made of them </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">trees!</span><span class="font5"> It has been an unspeakable joy to watch things grow. Next year will be even better, as things will have had a good start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lung trouble and arthritis and heart trouble have brought us to Arizona, and the outdoor life has been good for us. We are getting well on “barren land” that is yielding her increase prematurely in the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have also started to make brick for a sun-dried brick home. While getting well, and learning many lessons from the great Teacher, Jehovah himself, I observed the growth of citrus trees, vines, shrubs, flowers and almost everything growing to unbelievable loveliness. I thought, -if a little water can accomplish this now in the desert, how marvelous will be the desert when the. Kingdom is in full sway. See Isaiah 35. And when we made the adobe bricks, and added the straw, I tramped the mud with my bare feet, and the sticky mud plaster took off the corns and made my feet as soft as velvet. I thought, curiously, of the time when the Israelites lived in tents and made bricks for Pharaoh. See Exodus 5. I tramped the mud, put the bricks in the molds, and told my children and the neighbors the story while I worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Beautiful Flowers and Adorable Rattlers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My neighbors are religious, except for one witness. We have this desert territory together, which takes in part of Pabago Park and nearly to Tempe. There are citrus groves and date palm farms and greenhouses in this section, and there are also barren places, except for the traditional cacti. The blooms on the cacti are so ethereal in loveliness that one stands awed at the Creator’s works. There is no flower to be compared with the flowering cacti. The plants themselves are curious, and some bristle with the eternal stickers, but Jehovah has graced it with a crowning glory in its season, with the most exquisite blossoms found anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wild life here consists of the most hated of all beasts and insects on the North American continent. I mentioned a good many earlier in this writing, but the Gila monster and others do not come near settlements; they stay in the hills and out-of-the-way places. Others mentioned infest the homes and lands in thickly-settled places or anywhere else. They are treacherous only if they are disturbed, Their poison is administered only in their own defense. I have been visited by all those mentioned, including the snake. One rattler about a yard long invaded my kitchen, and got into a mesh bag of potatoes. I picked “Cleopatra” up and put him on a bench. He wiggled and I screamed. The boys took him outside with the potatoes, and my son George held him up on a stick and demanded, “Now are you going to let me go swimming?” I said, “No; and if you put that snake on me you had better hit the big dirt road and never come back.” He didn’t go swimming, but when I came back into the tent to light the stove, the light chain wrapped itself around my head and I thought it was Cleo’s mate. I let out another scream that could wake, up the dead. It is not right to kill snakes except in self-defense. You can make friends with them, and they do have their points. They eat gophers and mice and are better than watchdogs. One just has to get over his nervousness, that is all, and keep away from tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Resistance to Truth Is Breaking Down</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of niy neighbors is Delilah. But she is not like Delilah the Philistine [tool], I hope. Delilah took a set of books, to learn something about the New World. A back-call is planned, and we hope a study will result. Another neighbor is “Nan”, who is the daughter of Nimrod, “Nim” for short. No one could testify as to what was in the heart of Nimrod, as he is dead, but his descendants stubbornly refuse the word of God. I was so astonished to hear of anyone’s bearing the name of the “mighty hunter before the Lord” that I failed to inquire as to why he came to be called by such a name. I meet interesting people in my territory. They come here from every state in the Union. The Arizonans are made up mostly of Spanish-speaking people, with many Chinese, Negroes and Indians. The Hierarchy is not a remote enemy at all, but it is losing its grip. Resistance to truth is breaking down. It may be that the future holds many surprises for the Lord’s faithful.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Too-Much-Pape:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font5">OR a man that claims to know it all, the “Reverend Father” Charles Mortimer Carty shows about as bad a spirit and as little real scholarship as could be expected by a representative of the most bigoted of all the 256 sects doing business in the United States. In a little booklet entitled “The Freak Religion”, a term by which he designates the preaching of “this gospel of the Kingdom”, he says, with too-much-paper-and-ink and insufficient scholarship:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the opening words of St. John’s Gospel we read: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Pastor Russell tells us that the Word was not God, and appeals to the Greek, of which he knew nothing. “Notice,” he says, “that the Greek article 'ho’ precedes the first word 'God’ in this verse, but not the second word ‘God’. Thus, in the Greek, we have ‘The</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>-aiui-lnk Carty</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Word was with (ho theos) the God, and the Word was (theos) a God.’” The Atonement, p. 86. Pastor Russell thus “proves” that St. John intentionally made a difference between the supreme God who created all things, and the Word, who was a lesser god, “created” by the supreme God! But alas for the theory. Pastor Russell did not realize that the article was omitted in the expression, “The Word was God,” merely in accordance with the general ride of Greek grammar that in the simple sentence the subject takes the article, whilst the predicate omits it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it seems that Pastor Russell at least knew the difference between the subject-and the predicate, something that Mr. Carty does not know, or, if he does know, wishes to keep concealed. Any scholar will immediately admit that in John 1; 1 both words “God” are in the predicate.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Miscellany</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Raymond Street Jail</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Raymond Street jail, Brooklyn, was one of the disgraces of the nineteenth century, .and every century that goes by it gets no better. Unfit for human use, a dumping ground for drunken and inefficient keepers; an architectural monstrosity; an incubator of crime and disease; a human stewpot of vice and misery; a place where young boys and sex degenerates are all thrown together in a filthy cesspool of wretchedness, its cells are thus described in a 70-page presentment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A dungeon five feet wide, eight feet long and seven feet high. Against one wall a eot about three feet wide over which hangs an upper cot. Attached to an opposite wall, a table about two feet long and fifteen inches wide. The door to the dungeon is an iron grill with a small opening near the bottom. There is no window. No ray of sunshine, no fresh air can reach this cell. The food is shoved through a hole at the lower part of the iron-barred door, in the same manner as in the dungeons of the Dark Ages of A.D. 500. The wild animals in the Prospect Park zoo: receive treatment more nearly humane than do the humans incarcerated in the Raymond Street jail. Although the animals too are fed through the iron bars, their cages are more spacious and they get both gunshine and fresh air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The High Point of the Ceremony</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Associated Press carried a quarter of a column about some Greek Catholic Holy Land religious celebrations. It said that the &quot;high point” was when the Greek patriarch faced east, praying for the Armenians (mostly massacred); west, praying for the world (mostly then under the control of Hitler); south, for the fields and fruits of the earth (mostly, from where he stood, the sandy deserts of Arabia and Africa); and north, for the convents and hermitages (mostly filled with hypocrites) and the cities, villages and their inhabitants (mostly being bombed and in imminent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">danger of being poison-gassed and microbed). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It went on to say that “one of the most colorful ceremonies was the divine service of the holy fire in the Holy Sepulchre, symbolizing the Resurrection”. Nothing was said about the fights between the different sects which used often to occur at this place, and which the Moslems bad to guard against.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> had the story-headlined “Victory Prayers Rise at Jerusalem’s Rites”. Victory for whom, or when, or how, was not stated. The whole program was all so foolish that one wonders how the Greek Catholics could stomach it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Prayers That Back-fired</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ On one of my back-calls yesterday the lady was telling me how, at a recent testimony meeting in the Chi&gt;ch of God, one woman said she “had prayed the Lord that these Jehovah’s witnesses would move out of towm”. Said she had -told them she wished they would not call at her home any more and they had not been there since. Another woman testified to the same effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The preacher then took the floor and told them they were all wrong; that Jehovah’s witnesses were good, conscientious Christians, and, while he could not agree with all of their teachings, that they were being persecuted and the trouble in Little Rock was evidence of that, and that they should be left alone and no one should be talking about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then a Baptist lawyer, who attends the Church of God in an effort to get the spiritual food which he does not get at the Baptist church, took the floor and said he knew' some of these Jehovah’s witnesses personally and that they were good people and conscientious in their belief and he wanted to point out that they were not against the government. —Thomas E. Maddox, Arkansas.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Feeding the Lord’s Sheep in Italy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font5">ROM Italy comes a most thrilling experience. My brother has been in the army nearly two years, and meantime has become so intensely interested in God’s kingdom that he has requested that he be supplied with the' Society’s publications. He has taken his stand to the best of his ability, and sees the necessity of feeding the “other sheep”, as the following, copied from his letter, shows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After I began reading and understanding, I desired to be away from the seemingly godless crowd; so I began talking to the sergeant of the things I had learned. To my surprise I learned that he was a staunch Catholic, as were his parents before him. So we had many heated debates, and he always wound up by telling me I was crazy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But I kept peeking away at him, every chance I got, and read to him from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> I also gave him some of the books and booklets to read, but he continued going to mass every chance he got.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About two weeks ago, one Sunday morning, when I was reading the Bible, he was on his way to church and stopped and said, “Frost, what are you doing this evening? 1 want to see you.” So he came back that evening and started asking questions, and demanding Scripture proof for the things I believe. I did my best, reading the Scriptures and explaining them to him, all the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">couple of days later he called and said, “Frost, I finally see the light.” With that he took his prayer book, his prayer beads, and a pocketful of crucifixes and pictures of dead saints, walked over to the stove and put them in the fire. Now we study nightly together, and he is telling everybody, at least all the Italians that he can make understand, that they had better wake up, get out of the Catholic religion and start reading the Bible. He is a rather peculiar but very courageous person. He would not hesitate to stop anybody on the street and tell him what he thinks of the whole thing. He wrote his wife and sister and told them to get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses at once and start studying with them and learn something.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>A Newly-interested Family in Massachusetts</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">N A newdy-interested family in Milton, Mass., after the fifth book study, the father stated that he is considering the pioneer work; that he has been on the fence all his life, and that he is now going to jump, as this is what he has been looking for. The family consists of father, mother, Dorothy 8, and Frankie 5. The young man last named is helping hjs father take his stand. It came about like this: The family was attending a movie. In the scene before them, a soldier had been shot; it seemed that all were mourning; it was all very real and very tense; the theater was very, very quiet. Then Frankie, with, his shrill voice, piped out so that he could he heard all over the auditorium:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That woman does not need to worry about her husband. The Jehovah’s witness lady said that all that are in their graves will come back again. And if she waits, the Jehovah’s witness lady will call at her house and tell her; won’t she, mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You can’t blame the “Jehovah’s witness lady” for rejoicing before the Lord when she heard about that little five-year-old man, nor for her saying in her letter:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Extemporaneous Speech and Impromptu Speech Not the Same</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">NQUIRIES are received from time to time as to the distinction made between extemporaneous speaking and impromptu speaking. In a previous article of this series special consideration was given to extemporaneous speaking. It explained:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Extemporaneous speaking does not imply lack of preparation. On the' contrary, one carefully selects his material and outlines it just as if he were going to write out the talk. Instead of so doing, however, the speech is delivered from the outline and is not written olit in advance, or, if written out, is not delivered from the manuscript, nor memorized. This means thorough preparation. Wherein,'then, is it extemporaneous? In its phraseology. The speaker is familiar'with his subject. His mind is filled with ideas on it. He has such ideas in orderly arrangement, by means of either a mental or a written outline. Now, at the time of delivery, he extemporaneously puts these thoughts into words. [Issue No. 621, July 7, 1943]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the succeeding issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font5">July 21, 1943, this definition of impromptu speaking was offered:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Impromptu speaking is giving a talk on the spur of the moment; it is not planned or prepared. The speaker has no idea that he will be required to give a talk, but when occasions arise where questions are asked that necessitate immediate answers he must use the impromptu method of speaking. So, not only does the impromptu method of speech lack planning the phrasing of the words or language as does extemporaneous speaking, but it also lacks preparation of the material and the outlining and arranging thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some readers have questioned these definitions, and have written in for more information. They have compared the meanings given to these two words in various dictionaries and have found no distinction made. These dictionaries, doubtless most of them being small abridged copies, list as strictly synony-</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER 6, 1944 </span><span class="font5">mous the words extempore, extemporaneous, improvised, and impromptu. When the words are used with relation to speaking they are not synonymous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In discussing the shades of meaning involved in the words </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">extemporaneous </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">impromptu,</span><span class="font5"> Funk &amp;&nbsp;Wagnails unabridged </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New Standard Dictionary of the English Language</span><span class="font5"> states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Extemporaneous</span><span class="font3"> is now chiefly applied to addresses of which the thought has been prepared, and only the language and incidental treatment left to the suggestion of the moment, so that an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">extemporaneous</span><span class="font3"> speech is understood to be any one that is not read or recited; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">impromptu</span><span class="font3"> keeps its original sense, denoting something that springs from the instant; the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">impromptu</span><span class="font3"> utterance is generally brief, direct, and vigorous; the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">extemporaneous</span><span class="font3"> speech may chance to be prosy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Webster’s unabridged </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New International Dictionary of the English Language</span><span class="font5"> (Second Edition) says under the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">extempore:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Extempore</span><span class="font3"> (still often interchangeable with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">impromptu)</span><span class="font3"> is now more often applied to that which is spoken without the use of a manuscript, provided it has not been learned by • heart; the word does not necessarily exclude preparation; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">impromptu</span><span class="font3"> applies to that which is composed or uttered on the spur of the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Webster’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of Synonyms,</span><span class="font5"> an excellent book for getting at fine distinctions of so-called “synonymous” words, says this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Extemporaneous</span><span class="font3"> (now, in general use, the most common of the three words), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">extempore </span><span class="font3">(more often used adverbially) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">extemporary</span><span class="font3"> apply to something that is necessitated by the occasion or situation, such as a speech, a prayer, or a song, or in older and now rare use, something which must be hastily constructed, prepared, or produced; as, an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">extemporaneous</span><span class="font3"> oration; an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">extempore</span><span class="font3"> sermon; an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">extemporary</span><span class="font3"> altar; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">’‘extemporary </span><span class="font3">government” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Johnson).</span><span class="font3"> The terms, however, as applied to discourse, often suggest advance knowledge or thought and imply little more than the absence of a written record of what one intends to say . . . </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">impromptu</span><span class="font3"> stresses the immediate response to a need or suggestion and the spontaneous character of that which is composed, concocted, or the like, on the spur of the moment; as, an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">impromptu</span><span class="font3"> speech or reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books devoted to the subject of speaking are unanimous in making the distinction between extemporaneous and impromptu speeches as given in this series; and from the foregoing it is seen that the unabridged dictionaries and the better smaller ones likewise differentiate. The very fact that no name other than </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">extemporaneous</span><span class="font5"> exists for a speech prepared and outlined but delivered without manuscript or memorizing is evidence that extemporaneous is properly applied and restricted to that type of discourse. There is no other term to designate such speech. And </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">impromptu </span><span class="font5">identifies the totally unprepared and ‘on the spur of the moment’ speech. Thus the terms are properly delined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Which method is preferable? The extemporaneous is, if a choice is possible; but the very nature of impromptu makes choice of it mandatory. Circumstances dictate its use; and it should be used only when they do. If one knows beforehand that he is to discourse on a given subject, he should prepare, and he should use the extemporaneous method of speaking whenever possible. To conclude this article, a brief review of the advantages of this generally preferred method of speaking follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although well outlined and prepared, the talking effected by this method is not rigid and inflexible and it does not tie one down as would be the case in memorizing or reading directly from a manuscript. Particularly, then, will this be of great advantage in presenting information and argument before courts and boards, in debates, on back-calls, as servants to the brethren, and on many other occasions where one must present the truth and make full proof of his ministry. At these times interruptions may occur and questions may be asked that</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">must be answered. By employing the extempore method all of this can be handled and dealt with properly without disrupting the continuity of the outlined material which must be presented. At times local conditions and last-minute occurrences may require rearrangement to meet the situation. Were the outline designed and cast in a rigid die, this would be difficult, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another feature of extempore speaking is that the delivery will be much warmer. The thoughts and ideas only are in one’s mind and he will be free to think on the subject as he talks. He will be alert and stirred to activity. As the material arranged comes in its due order for presentation, it will warm up and be delivered with genuine meaning. The talking will not be dry and stereotyped and the mind will not be cramped and thought-shackled. It will even give birth to new ideas not included in the original outline. The speaker will be able to capitalize on all opportunities that may arise in which he can increase interest in and add to the convincing qualities of his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One important aim in speaking and which can be especially attained with the extempore style is that of contact. A speaker may have a talk flaviess in make-up and material but if he loses contact with his audience, much is lost. To be effective and to accomplish its intended purpose, the speaker’s presentation must be personal, direct, and ‘straight from the shoulder’. To the extent that his contact is sidetracked or interfered with, so 'is the value of his presentation lessened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Contact works both ways. To the audience it means greater enjoyment and appreciation and to the speaker it means the opportunity to express his sincerity and conviction on the subject being considered. Because with the extemporaneous style his mind, his eyes, and his hands are free; he will be speaking not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font5"> his audience but </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> them. He will be conversing with them and will be able to watch their reactions and adjust his time and stress accordingly. It will give him the opportunity to make further exposition on important points not fully grasped and in all ways the talk will be more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The value and importance of these features cannot be overstressed. Observe how this is demonstrated in the example of an important court case, a case where the issues to be argued are vital to the upholding of principles of freedom and of human rights. Anything that would detract from the forcefulness and clearcut presentation to the court must be avoided. The one who will present the argument to the court must employ extempore speaking and attain to its highest and most finely finished form. His time will be limited, and therefore preparation must be even more exhaustive and precise so as to incorporate every detail of the argument supporting his side of the question at issue. The undivided attention of the court must be obtained. Necessarily he will memorize his outline so as to he able to speak directly to the judges and jury. He will have to anticipate interruptions and questions from the court, and consequently all of the points of his argument must be so indelibly marked in his mind that he can handle these interruptions and still be able to hold to the vital points previously prepared and which must be properly argued. His success in accomplishing this would be certain to have some effect upon the considering of the case for decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still in consideration of advantages, we might note that which might at first appear to be a disadvantage: the actual words used in the delivery. The speaker . will have ideas and thoughts memorized, not words; but the words will come. The words may not be finely polished and eloquent, the speaker may even stumble a little, but they will express the sincerity and wholeheartedness of tire one talking. The audience will be able to note this and fhey will see that it is the speaker’s conviction that is being expressed. The feeling should he the same as when conversing with someone. One does not premeditate words, but one does have an idea and expresses it naturally. This feature is, of course, of special benefit to Jehovah’s servants today because the message which they deliver is the Lord’s and should be expressed as coming from the heart.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Aetius the</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HE clearest things about the life of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aetius (a-e'shi-us) are that “he wrote about 300 theological treatises, one of which has been preserved”, and that the historians of hrs own and subsequent times so hated him for these 300 works that they destroyed all but one of them and gave him the name “Atheist” because -he did not explain things in’ the way in . which they like to have them explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is admitted by his critics that he studied the Scriptures in Antioch, in Anazarbus and in Tarsus. There is nothing wrong about that. They go on to -say that he became a grammarian, a logician, a deacon, and a bishop (caretaker in a congregation of God’s people). If his critics had spared more than one of his 300 works it would have been easier to calculate what progress he had made in these four activities. It doesn’t seem as if attention to any or all of these would earn him the name “Atheist”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Anybody can call names. Ib doesn’t take any brains or any Christianity to do that. Aetius was called an &quot;atheist” merely because he did not believe in the same kind of god as did his trinitarian critics. He taught that “to us there is but one God” (1 Corinthians 8:6), and trinitarians cannot endure persons who teach things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The title of the work that was saved is “De Fide” (“Concerning the Faith”). That is a curious kind of title for an “atheist” to give to a book. Do you not think so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font5"> says about this man:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the first synod of Sirmium he won a dialectic victory over the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hornoiousian</span><span class="font3"> bishops, Basilius and Eustathius, who sought in eonse-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>“Atheist”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">quence to stir up against him the enmity of Caesar Gallus,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ah! the light gradually seeps in. He got his degree of &quot;Atheist” because he knew too much Scripture to get caught between the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hornoiousian</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">homoou-sian</span><span class="font5"> pincers within which the Devil tried to squeeze the life out of anybody in those days who dared to study the Scriptures and to use his own brains in trying to explain them to others. The gist of the controversy, in the case of Aetius, is that he “held that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">homousian</span><span class="font5"> doctrine of the begotten Son as God is self-contradictory, since the nature of God is eternal and unbegotten”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is entirely impossible for trinitarians to tell the truth about the beliefs of those with whom they disagree. They make a great show of wisdom about whether Christ was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">homoiousios</span><span class="font5"> (of like substance) or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">homoousws</span><span class="font5"> (of the same substance) as respects Almighty God, His Creator and His Father, but neither of the Greek words which they bandy around so much in their efforts to uphold their doctrine appears in God’s Word at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aetius was banished by Constantius, one of the Roman emperors, but was recalled from exile by Julian, another one, and finally died in Constantinople, A.D. 367. Before his death the Roman Government had given him a pension, as compensation for his exile. And in view of the fact that the exile was at the behest of religionists in the first place, this was quite a decent thing for them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s true people derive a great deal of comfort from Jesus’ words in the Sermon on the Mount,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">say</span><span class="font3"> all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Did not the religionists say to Christ Jesus, “Say we not well that thou aft a Samaritan, and hast a devil?” Did not the religionists say all manner of evil things about former presidents of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society? Isn’t that a part of a Christian’s inheritance—-to thus fill up the afflictions of Christ which are left behind “for his body’s sake, which is the church”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have you ever stopped to think that there are 256 sects listed in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World Almanac,</span><span class="font5"> but Jehovah's witnesses is not one of them? And, do you also know that these witnesses are doing more work, putting out more truth about Jehovah’s kingdom, than all the sects just mentioned, and yet, and despite their absolute loyalty to God and His Word, they are often treated, and spoken of, and spoken to, as if they were the very worst kind of heathen—“atheists,” if you please, like Aetius?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">the spring of 1938, and that most of this enlargement is to be found in the 31 Jehovah’s witnesses eases.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font5"> PUBLISHED editorial discloses the opinion of Judge Edward F. Waite, retired judge of the district court of Minnesota. Excerpts follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a lengthy and fascinating article in the March number of the Minnesota Law Review, Judge Waite lists 31 Jehovah’s witnesses cases which have come before the supreme court since 1938 and shows how the verdicts rendered have widened the area of freedom of speech, broadened the conception of freedom of the press, and made far more sweeping the protections accorded the exercise of religious freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Judge Waite begins with the ease of Lovell v. City of Griffin, a case in which the conviction of a Jehovah’s witness for distributing pamphlets without written permission from the city manager of Griffin, Ga., was set aside in such terms as greatly to increase the protection of the press from any control or censorship under the guise of license restrictions. He carries the study down through the famous reversals of the Gobitis and Jones v. Opelika cases, and winds up with the Prince v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts case . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In every instance he shows that the result of each Jehovah’s witness’ landing before the supreme court has been a strengthening or enlarging of the civil liberties of all Americans. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It is plain,&quot; says the judge, “that present constitutional guarantees of personal liberty . . . are far broader than they were before</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Americans of Japanese Ancestry </span><span class="font5">♦ (1) There has been no known case of sabotage by the Japanese in Hawaii, says Mr. Stimson, secretary of war,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) The F.B.I. reports that there has been no known case of sabotage on the West Coast by the Japanese. '</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(3) There are 5,000 Japanese-Ameri-cans in the armed forces of America.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(4) The Japanese-Americans have more young people in college per capita than any other group in American life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(5) Their crime percentage is the lowest of any group in America.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(6) They had almost none upon relief during the depression,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(7) I have been in high schools where a Japanese boy had been chosen by the student b.ody as the president of the student body. When I asked how it happened, the reply was, “The finest boy in the school and the students are fair; so they chose him,”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Will the rest of America be as fair as those students and judge a man by what he is and not by his racial antecedents? Some of the finest citizens of America are from German and Italian stock and we are proud of them. We should also be proud of these loyal Americans of Japanese descent.—E.
