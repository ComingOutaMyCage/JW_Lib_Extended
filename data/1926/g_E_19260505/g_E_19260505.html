<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6"> POLISH naturalist has discovered in Bra</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">zil, in an unfrequented valley, a Polish settlement that has been lost since the year 1873. The original settlers have all died off; but their children and grandchildren, to the number of 1,000, were found healthy and happy, and still talking their own language. Their existence was unknown to the Brazilian government or people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">British Empire, which is calculated to be 463,000,000, only one person in seven is of European stock. The remaining 397,000,000 are governed only by the superior mental, moral or physical force of their white rulers. This superiority is disappearing and the powers of the colored races are expanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Items of Life in Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Britain’s Profits on Rubber</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">L</span><span class="font6">AST year as many railway journeys were made in Britain as there are people in the whole world, yet there was but one passenger killed in a train accident. Magistrates in Wales have revived the curfew, forbidding dancing after ten o’clock p. m., and on Sundays and Tuesdays. Somebody in Britain is getting crooked, because short weights and skimpy measures are becoming so common that legislation against them is now necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A School for Gipsy Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">N SURREY County, England, there is a portable school for gipsy children. Whenever the gipsies move on the school moves with them. There were forty children in school on the first day it was in operation. At night there are classes for the almost equally ignorant grown-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ups. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reductions in Church of England Salaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE Liverpool </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post and Mercury</span><span class="font6"> contains the surprising information that the Church of England advocates the reduction of the salaries of its archbishops and bishops from about $45,000 per year to about $15,000. But the surprise is lessened when the discovery is made that what is taken off from salaries is to be added to expenses of these dignitaries, and that the real object of the proposed change is merely to reduce the amount of income taxes which they will pay. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font6">RITAIN’S profits on rubber at $1. a pound, and on tin at $1,435 a ton, which are now the ruling prices, are said to be sufficient to enable Britain to pay off her debt to America in four years. The employment situation in Britain is improving, but with fears as to what the coal situation will be in April when the subsidy expires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Americanization of Europe '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IN NOTHING has the Americanization of Europe shown itself more than in the increasing habit of European business men to give up their long and heavy midday meals and resort to the American glass of milk and crackers eaten at the desk, or the quick lunch counter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France Absorbs Foreigners</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE American Commissioner at. the Paris -*■ headquarters of the International Chamber of Commerce estimates that more than one million foreign workmen have come to France and stayed there since the close of the war, taking the places in industry of the hosts slain in the war. Unemployment is still practically un-know’n in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The War Toll in France</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Terrible as was the war toll in England, where one man in sixty-six was killed, it was more terrible in Germany, where one man in thirty-five was killed, and still more terrible in France, where one man in every twenty-eight was killed. In the latter country one-seventh of the agricultural male population was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tram Telephony A Success in Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Train telephony in Germany is a complete success. A call from Berlin or Hamburg to the train, or the reverse, costs from 94 cents to $1.30 for the first three minutes. The service is satisfactory and perfect in every way, and all important trains between Berlin and Hamburg are now fitted with the necessary equipment to render this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Italy's State Lottery &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font6">ITH Denmark and some other countries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Italy shares the humiliation of having a state lottery. In other words, the state is a partner in and an encourager of gambling in one of its grossest forms. Like all gambling machines, the lottery machine is fixed so that the proprietor never loses. In two days recently the Italian government made $5,000,000 from its lottery, nearly all taken from people that could ill afford the loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rearrangement of Agricultural Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">C</span><span class="font6">REDIT must be given Mr. Mussolini for a new plan which has in it much of merit. He proposes to build new villages in the centers of the wheat-growing districts, so that farmers may live near their work and save the time and fatigue of going many miles to and from their work as they now do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Makwar Dam Opened</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE British Makwar dam across the Blue</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nile, which is intended to irrigate three million acres in the Sudan, has been formally opened. The dam is two miles long, 128 feet high at the deepest point, has 206 spillways, and is the largest enterprise of the kind in the world. The principal crop intended to be raised in the irrigated areas is cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reforms in Turkey</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Reform follows reform in Turkey so fast that it is hard to keep up with them. Recent changes are the adoption of the Roman alphabet, the abandonment of the old Turkish notion that work is degrading, and the abolition of wedding gifts by law. Marriage feasts which hitherto have lasted for a week are now limited to one day. The object is to encourage matrimony. Turkey has taken all power and every platform of social influence from the ecclesiastical class, which it recognizes as the most degenerate and least progressive part of its population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Aldan Gold Fields</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font6">HAT are believed to be the richest gold fields in the world are now being exploited on the Aldan river, five hundred miles from the nearest station on the Trans-Siberian railway. By a decree of the Russian Soviet government none but Russians may work in these fields. On account of primitive methods of work, the earnings of the men are small, averaging only about $100 a month, The gold is in the form of dust,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Persia's First Census</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">P</span><span class="font6">ERSIA’S first, census brought to light a woman 146 years of age, living with her son 117 years of age. Persia is figuring on a complete railway system and is also negotiating for airplane service to and from Paris, across Germany and Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Way They Do in Afghanistan</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> reminds us that in Afghanistan if a man puts out the eye of another, one of his own eyes is put out by a burning glass; if be causes a man to lose a tooth, one of his own teeth is filed down level to the gum; if caught in a theft, he loses his right hand; if caught in another, he loses his left foot; if caught again, death is the penalty. Highway robbery is punishable by death, or by amputation of hands and feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">An Affectionate Horse in Scotland</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">N SCOTLAND recently, at a pier on the Firth of Clyde, a vessel turned partly over in the water, imprisoning two horses in the hold. One of these was rescued and placed on the beach; but missing his companion he walked into the water and swam back to the ship, whinnying around it until finally the other horse was rescued and the two were placed on the beach together.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Civilization on the Precipice </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By 'J. A. Robinson</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE word civilization, according to Webster, means, “reclamation from the savage state, or instruction in refinement; culture.” The word precipices signifies, “The edge of a deep descent.” Therefore, “Civilization on the Precipice” means that the order of society under which we now live, after boasting of its “evolution” from the barbaric state, has so declined as to be at the very tip of a steep descent which may mean its oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It stands like a drunken giant on the brink of a canyon. Our system of refinement, of cultural education producing such a civilization, has signally failed of its objective; hence it must have been based upon a false premise, or 'was faulty in its construction; and in either event it has been untrue in its teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The question is, Is civilization on the precipice ? If so, what is the cause! And what will be the outcome? The answer may prove a silver lining to the otherwise dark and ominous cloud portending trouble. As civilization is still existent a prediction is necessary. Predictions are usually far from the truth, except when based upon solid facts. Therefore facts must be assembled to support the prediction here made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the present condition of civilization is precipitous, dark and uncertain, no one can well deny. In fact the human heart cries and groans for relief from the oppressiveness of the present order, the cries and groans varying in intensity in proportion to the immediate circumstances of the industrial slave. Hence the conclusion that distress, discontent and restlessness on the part of the great majority exist wholesale, is based upon facts revealed by investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Investigations usually result in quashing. The facts revealed are usually hushed up, but not always. We hail the courage and honesty of those few in whose heart is a. chord of sympathetic feeling for their fellow men, and who refuse to remain silent in view of the atrocities practised in the name of civilization. All honor should be accorded to courage of this sort; for it provides us with necessary data warning us of impending doom, that we may make proper preparation for the safety of those under our responsibility. Therefore by dissecting the present order of things, as revealed by fearless and honest investigators, we may be able to determine the outcome. Let us view some of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">elements of modern civilization with which wa are surrounded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Labor</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">L</span><span class="font6">ABOR is that portion of the present order who do the world’s work. Even the moneyed system itself calls them the producers. Thus this class is clearly separated from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">parasites </span><span class="font6">who “toil not, neither do they spin”. For centuries the working element has borne the burden and heat of the day. Slavery and ignorance have been their lot. Rulers have plotted and planned to keep them in subjection. Realizing at last its inability to obtain its rights, labor has banded itself together in unions and fraternal orders, believing that in unity there is strength, but with much disappointment; for from within and without spies upset their plans, and in the place of brotherly love and fraternity, selfishness frequently abounds!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indifference on the part of employer has produced a similar feeling in employes. Indifference is the first step to disintegration. The giant thus takes his first drink. Stone number one becomes loosened on the brink of the canyon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Royalty</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font6">HAT a gigantic hoax is this that has been foisted upon labor in his ignorance, that a few fellow mortals should consider themselves of special origin and right! A sterile class, living upon the backs of the workers, and at the same time claiming the authority of the gods for so doing! Can it be that their blood is superior to that of the humble toiler? Cannot the worker’s corned beef and cabbage produce the very life blood of Irish kings? Likewise the spaghetti and garlic the supposedly blue blood of Latin monarchs? Did the German Kaiser have a celestial brewery to give him special tone and color “by divine right” ? And does some angelic messenger bring to George V his five meals a day in order to maintain the proper standard of vital fluid necessary to his arduous task as king of an empire in whose politics he really has no voice? Thanks be to God that such frauds have lost their power in recent years. The king business is on the wane. Thus the giant takes drink number two, while another stone is shaken loose under his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font6">CHOOLS and colleges should have first place in any system of civilization; for education is the very backbone of society. Yet it is sad to note that, as Ingersoll put it, our colleges polish the pebble and dim the diamond. Speaking specifically of one New England academy he said that a professor of this, school could not take his seat until he had taken oath to the effect that he would not advance intellectually for five years; then he must renew the oath if he would remain any longer. Is it not a fact that our whole educational system smacks of subsidization rather than of untainted civilization ? The seat of learning has become commercially contaminated. Education, free press, free speech, the greatest foes to barbarism, have again been throttled and chained. Thus the giant has taken another long swallow of the blinding and maddening intoxicant, as he. advances one step nearer to the edge of the abyss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">War &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260505_files/g_E_19260505-3.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">ONSIDERING the fact that mankind is of one family, limited to one tiny sphere of the universe, the object of mundane civilization should be the complete elimination of the relics of barbarism from this planet. National boundaries, breeders of jealousies, all relics of the past, are still maintained. We have not emerged from the barbaric, tribal rivalries of yesterday. How can we, so long as we maintain and cherish the petty relics of the savage past? War is the result of international differences. International differences are relics of savagery, from which civilization was expected to have freed us. If civilization </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">does</span><span class="font6"> exist it has signally failed in its mission; we are still barbaric. Every international difference is another intoxicating draught by the already drunken giant called Civilization, who is listlessly but certainly staggering to the very edge of the yawning chasm of oblivion. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'Justice</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260505_files/g_E_19260505-4.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">GLARING example of the uncertainty of the giant’s step is found in the modern administration of law. Law should mete out to all men uncompromising </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">justice,</span><span class="font6"> that unbending and unchangeable principle of God as revealed in nature. Yet our lawyers attempt to use it pro and con, in defense of the criminal as well as in defense of the innocent, until so-called constitutional rights often become a myth. The law that can defend the guilty and fail to protect the innocent is detrimental to the purposes of civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A recent instance in point was the defense of two internationally famous, cases by the same prominent criminal lawyer 'who, in the first case, used the Bible to attempt the justification of two youthful and wealthy murderers, but who flatly denied its sacred authority when defending a law-breaking school teacher in Tennessee a few ■weeks later. Such procedure should not be labeled justice, honor or civilization. This double-dealing in law is not confined, to a few cases or localities. It is general, world-wide. Therefore it is not a. cause for surprise when we see the drunken giant wending his way nearer and nearer to the brink of the canyon of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Medicine .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpHERAPEUTICS, which deals with the pre-®- vention and cure of diseases, is a science of great worth when'properly applied for the alleviation of human suffering. With sickness, disease and death on every hand the doctor should find a useful place in human society. After centuries of attempt and opportunity, with billions of organisms on which to practise, this profession should have reached a stage of development second to none. Summing up the results. of modern medicine’s share in the reclamation of the human family we quote from Dr. Gregory of Edinburgh, who says: “Ninety-nine out of every hundred medical facts are medical lies, and medical doctrines are for the most part stark, staring nonsense.” Dr. Ramage, F. R. G., of London, corroborates this statement, and adds: “The present system of medicine is a burning shame to its professors.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other fearless authorities are even stronger in their denunciation of modern medicine, calling it jargon, deception, professional hypocrisy and even legalized murder. It is not to be won-. dered that after such serious charges by members of their own Told we should find the medical profession frantically using all their power, and the wealth obtained under false pretenses, in securing legislation to prevent all other systems of therapy, lest these newer and better methods further decrease the revenue of the old-line medics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Note the alleged shameless attempt of this system to bribe the editor of an eastern magazine with a quarter of a million dollars to refrain from printing articles upon a drugless method of curing disease, and the&quot; warning that if he refused they would spend half a million in putting his publication out of business. The intoxicated giant imagines the world is made for him. Delirious, he takes a terrific reel and barely escapes the final fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Politics</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">P</span><span class="font6">OLITICS is the method by which the world is ruled. Man has been taught to believe that civilization has so progressed that he can now vote and rule himself. If man has succeeded in ruling himself why should those in power who have robbed the people of their wealth use that wealth to defeat the wishes of the people, spending fourteen million dollars to elect a man almost unknown to the people? How could it be worth that tremendous amount if fairness rules the actions of men, if civilization really exists? The people vote, but they do not rule in any country today. The soggy giant drinks on and staggers at the very edge of the dizzy precipice,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Finance</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">[NANCE is the octopus of our civilization, ever ready and willing to enslave the world and if need be to reduce it to the state of barbaric slavery to gain its end. Its profiteering plans portend the ruin of civilization, and its methods are sure of success in that direction. It fails to note that poverty breeds barbarism, and that the poverty of the masses is the road to the savage state from which we are supposed to have emerged by becoming &quot;civilized”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When predatory wealth endows a school it . uses the money which it has stolen from the people to make the people think they are being philanthropically educated and civilized, when &lt;in reality it is but another way of throwing dust into the people's eyes, while they are made into ■ more profitable servants for their speculative masters. Speculation breeds high prices; high prices and big profits demanded by profiteers call for low labor cost; and this means low wages, high cost of living, and poverty which produces barbarism, the destruction of civilization. Frenzied finance is the fatal draught that goads the mighty giant to his final plunge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">L</span><span class="font6">AST but not least among the contributory causes of the impending crisis is that diabolical element of superstitious fear misnamed religion. There is a true religion and there is a false religion, and the latter predominates in every land. True religion is designed to teach reverence and adoration for our Maker, and the conduct of justice and righteousness between fellow men. Reverence is a normal faculty of mankind, but this faculty has been prostituted and commercialized by religious leaders who have taught men to kill, to lie, to steal, to swear falsely, and even to worship material things of wood and stones, like their savage ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Apostate religion, organized and powerful, is needed to encourage the slaughter of man, to invoke God’s blessing (?) upon bloody war. to teach man how to vote against himself and at the same time imagine lie is voting for his own interests, to keep man quiet and serene while' his employers rob his children of bread, to make man believe that while his children are at school they are receiving an education in refinement and culture, when in reality they are being taught how to perpetuate a tottering civilization that systematically robs the people to keep the kings upon their thrones and the peasants in poverty. Such are the needs of a false religion, and such are the accomplishments of the hypocritical ecclesiastical system which now exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Noav and then an honest religionist arises to &quot;upset the apple cart” by telling a little truth, with the result that the ecclesiastics cry: &quot;Heresy, sedition, lies.” But after investigation it is invariably found that the ecclesiastical complain-ers are the falsifiers, generally full of poison and breeders of superstition and ignorance, •which, engender slavery, debauchery and crime, This ecclesiastical element, cooperating with politicians and big business, is largely responsible for the 'wholesale enslavement and universal poverty amongst mankind, which may ultimately lead to world-wide anarchy in which the rapid descent of the drunken giant of civilization over the precipice to complete an everlasting destruction will occur, and with it the complete overthrow of all institutions detrimental to human welfare. But upon the ruins thereof will then arise the long-awaited kingdom of God. Thy kingdom cornel</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Peace' or War —Which? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By c. J. Fekei</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">W</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">AT</span><span class="font6">?, is a business. It is advocated by those who profit by it. Every available means is used to agitate and inflame the diseased and unstable mind of man. A contented, peace-loving neighbor is pictured as a revengeful, covetous and greedy enemy. The military man cries, “We are unprepared.” The prognosticator yells, “Our neighbor is ready to seize us by the throat,” while the munition maker and profiteer insist that for safety’s sake we must fill our vaults and cellars with their wares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it any wonder that the Revelator said, “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the ‘whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty” ?—Revelation 16:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In answer to the question, Bo large armaments provoke war? Dr. Jefferson said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They do. First, they are enormous masses of explosives. Dump down in frc-it of iry house a ton of dynamite or gunpowder and I at once become nervous. I cannot help it. I know there are some bad boys and I cannot sleep while it is there. Armaments piled along frontiers are piles- of gunpowder disturbing national security. For forty years Europe tossed and moaned in a hideous nightmare. Wr.r itself came at last as a relief. Fear begets suspicion. Out of suspicion springs dislike. Dislike deepens into hate, and hate rushes to bloodshed. Fear, suspicion, dislike, hate and slaughter take nations down the stair vay to hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only did General Sherman say, “War is cruelty and cannot be refined, war is hell,” but General Tasker H. Bliss has declared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The responsibility is entirely upon the professing Christians of the United States. If another war like the last one should come, they will be responsible for every drop of blood that will be shed, and for every dollar wastefully expended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under an editorial -entitled “Slandering a Race” the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sim</span><span class="font6"> remarked that false propaganda has led us to regard Mexico as an unscrupulous, unprincipled coward, with a cigarette in his mouth and a bloody dagger in his belt. This is Mexico as fiction, the stage and the films ... usually present. One would be led to think that in Mexico the flowers have no odors, the birds have no songs, that there is no honor among men,nor virtue among women in that sister republic. The truth is the reverse of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Fred B. Smith, chairman of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, on returning from a three months trip abroad, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In India Christianity is called a warring, bloodspilling religion. The East says, “Christ, a cannon ball, a submarine, and a gas bomb go together.” If war is part of the Christian religion, and actions speak louder than . words, then the heathen want none of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We would not be surprised to hear the heathen using a new figure of speech. Instead of saying, “'They fight like cats and dogs,” “like tigers,” or “like devils”, they may justly say, “They fight like Christians.” This reminds us of ‘ ’ the interesting argument made in the Connecticut legislature many years ago. A bill offered to charter a foreign missionary society was opposed on the ground that it would export religion, which was all needed at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Military men agree that “peace is better than war, war is unchristian”, but they also say, “War always has been and always will be/” Exactly the same was said of slavery and duelling, which men thought were permanently fixed.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">upon society; but their abolition was easy when men decided to abolish them. Why not abolish war? Some may have thought that War would become less cruel, more humane, as we become more civilized; but the recent great tonflict, and present preparations for the next on* show that the very reverse is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Folly of War</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;War is the most ferocious and futile of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ « human follies. It never decides who is right but only who is the stronger,” said John Hay. The truth of this statement cannot be questioned. The desire for peace burns in every human heart. Many a mother’s heart has been wrung, many a father’s has been racked with pain, millions of children have been made orphans, and billions of property have been destroyed by this idiotic diversion which men call War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the court of brute force the victor is both the judge and the jury and fixes the verdict to please himself. It is an established principle of justice that when two individuals disagree</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">neither should be allowed to fix the terms of settlement. The same is true of two corporations. Why not then also with two nations? It is not a difficult matter for two disagreeing parties to consent to the decision of an impartial judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The folly of war is evident when we consider its unrighteousness, its uncertainty and its vast expense. If a man kills another he is an assassin. If a thousand men kill another thousand they are considered heroes. The deed is the same; war is criminal. Men who never exchanged cross words, who never even saw each other, are caused to unite in bloody, brutal conflict. 'Afid behind these human pawns on each side, inciting both armies to devilish deeds, stands the professed Christian church hypocritically chanting, “God is with us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Others may do as they will, but the true Christian cannot help but recall what the Apostle John said: “Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and we know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.”—1 John 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The inevitable tendency of war is to harden the hearts of men, to make them less appreciative of the just rights of others, and less sensible to torture, pain and suffering. Andrew’ J. Palm records the feelings of Captain Stoica as he looked into the face of the first man he ever killed. What horror, what a nightmare! The account is too terrible to review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spirit and teachings of Jesus are absolutely irreconcilable with war. It is said that between the years 50-170 A. D. men threw down their arms and accepted death as traitors, by simply saying, “I am a Christian, and therefore I cannot fight.” James Russell Lowell said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Ez for war I call it murder;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There you have it plain and flat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You don’t want to go no furder Than my New Testament for that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In contrast to the uncertainty of an armed peace stands the tranquility of an assured friendship. For seventy years under William Penn, Pennsylvania did hot have the loss of a man, woman or child by the Indians, though other colonies were in constant terror. From the time the Quakers were outvoted in the legislature and the state began to depend on force, trouble with the Indians began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Cost of War</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TF THE time, energy and money devoted to war (a destructive process) had been used in the pursuits of peace (for the betterment of mankind) they would have converted the world into a garden of Eden. Mr. Herbert Brown, head of the Efficiency Bureau of the United States government, declared that 85% of the money paid to the government in taxes goes for wars, past and prospective. Using the 1924 budget as a basis Mr. Brown estimated that of every dollar, 25¢ goes to the Veterans Bureau, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">17¢</span><span class="font6"> to the army and navy, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4¢</span><span class="font6"> is devoted to special war activities, 28¢ for interest, and 11¢ for the retirement of the public debt. This leaves just 15^ for the civil government. That is, only 15% of the money collected in taxes is used to run the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nearly every war has been extremely costly to the generation then living as well as to the future ones. In 1862 President Lincoln proposed a resolution which passed both houses, and which provided that every state that would abolish slavery before 1900 should be paid for its slaves. Three hundred dollars was given for each slave of the District of Columbia when it abolished slavery. Delaware, because loyal to the Union, was offered four hundred dollars for each of her slaves, but the state legislature refused to accept anything. Even at this price slavery could have been abolished still cheaper than by war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the late World War, the war to end war (?), it took 390 shells to kill one man, and half that number to wound one. The war cost Germany two million of her citizens, eighty-five percent of her territory, and increased her national debt seven.thousand percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">France claims thirty-three billion dollars as an indemnity from Germany, the interest of which at four percent is three and a half million dollars for every day of the year. France lost 1,654,000 men, 500,000 houses, 25,000 miles of highway, and 3,000 miles of railway. Her debt increased 800%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">England lost 939,000 lives, and her national debt increased 700%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The United States lost 109,000 lives, and our national debt increased 2,300%. One-half of this amount, borrowed from the people through Liberty Loans, etc., was taken and loaned to foreign nations who have not paid it back, nor even the interest thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The amount appropriated to the navy by the United States in the last ten years is sufficient to build fifty good roads from the Atlantic to the Pacific at $40,000 per mile, and still leave a billion dollars to spare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1914 the debt of France was greater than that of the United States, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Rumania, Serbia, Norway and Sweden combined. Since then she has spent billions in order to make her army the greatest of any nation on earth., The four years of war cost France more than would have been the cost of a century of peaceful government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">How Wars Will Cease</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font6">ARS will not cease so long as huge armies are used to coerce weaker powers. Examples of this are when Bosnia and Herzegovina were taken by Austria in 1908. Germany appeared in shining armor at the side of Austria and the case was “settled”. Later at Agadir Great Britain appeared in armor at the side of France and coercion, not reason, silenced all opposition. But disputes so silenced never stay settled. When people tire of being constrained by force, war in some form results. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">'An</span><span class="font6">d now, as a consequence, there are two million less men in England than there are women, and one million female surplus in Turkey, besides- the numberless orphans to take care of in both countries—to say nothing of the situation in Germany and in France, which is much worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wars will cease when the propaganda favorable to war is exterminated by divine power. Until then, Sauls will continue to hurl javelins at Davids, Davids will put Uriahs in the front line to fight, and Hamans will plot against Mordecais. Individual habits as well as those of nations are hard to change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The late Lord Northcliffe, who owned the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Daily Graphic, Daily Express, Evening News, Daily Times, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Dispatch</span><span class="font6"> frankly said during the war that he -would not allow the least item to be printed in his papers that would wound France or be agreeable to Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The seeds of war are planted in almost all literature. In the latest encyclopedia fifteen times more space is devoted to Napoleon Bonaparte “the human butcher” than to Henry Ford, although the latter is the richest man on earth, employs about 60,000 persons and, by bringing town and country together, has revolutionized the industry of the world. Napoleon’s disgraceful fame rests on his heartless jest, “I killed but a million and they were mostly Dutchmen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Individual habits are hard to break. The late Walter II. Page, United States Ambassador to Great Britain during the World War, told in the days of President Wilson that in England a pot of herbs was still put on every court desk, although this custom originated in Defoe’s time, two hundred years ago, and for the purpose of keeping away a plague. In the United States Senate it is said that the snuff boxes continued, to be cleaned regularly and filled until only one snuff-using member remained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though the metric system of measurement was invented by James Watt in 1786 and is vastly simpler and superior to our present system, yet it has not been adopted by either the United States or Britain merely because of habit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The medical profession declaimed against the first bathtub, and Boston passed an act forbidding bathing in one unless prescribed by a physician. This act was not repealed until 1862.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">War, in like manner, continues to be resorted to for the settlement of international disputes because it has become an international habit that is hard to break. Nor will wars ever cease by a mere word agreement between the present world powers. .Such treaties have repeatedly proven themselves to be mere scraps of paper; In 1889 at the Hague a treaty banning gas or chemical warfare was drawn up. Germany agreed not to use poison gas, but in 1915 she introduced chlorine on the plea of “necessity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A treaty prohibiting poisonous gas, and limiting submarines in time of war, was signed February 6,1922, by the delegates of the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan at the Washington Disarmament Conference. Still preparations to use them go merrily on. The government’s forty-five million dollar chemical warfare plant at Edgewood, Md., is still functioning, and so too are those of other nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The disarmament treaty has been ratified but the preparations for war still continue. After ratification of the pact, the Italian army established a chemical warfare service, and a factory is now busy making war gasses for her future use. Chinese factions are using gas bombs, and the Bolshevik army has a gas and flame section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although the final cataclysm of trouble upon the world is inevitable, yet the people of good will may take heart. Nevertheless, the nations have been made drunk with the wine (intoxicating false doctrines) of Babylon (Christendom); they stagger, to and fro, and are at their wits’ end. Our King will yet arise and tell us to view His works in the earth, as His prophet declared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and - cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. Be still and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.” (Psalm 46: 8-10) “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.” (Zephaniah 2:3) “And he [the Lord] shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks■: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” —Isaiah 2:4.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Health of the American Sailor ■</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. W. Armistead Gills, United States 'Navy (Retired)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">N THE five years from 1920 to 1924 inclusive, out of a navy personnel of 827,099 there were 2,341 diagnoses of organic heart disease, 2,927 of tuberculosis, 6,760 of acute and chronic rheumatism, 5,235 of hernia, 62,301 of gonorrhea and its complications, 4,972 of pneumonia, 68,641 of acute and chronic tonsilitis, and 9,065 of acute and chronic ear disease. Of these sailors and marines 720 suffering from mastoiditis required surgical intervention—their skulls were chiseled open. Twenty-four died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Free care of the teeth is among the inducements to enter the service. Here is a resume of some of our most important statistics: Number of eases of diseased gums, 30,022; abscessed teeth, 25,812; teeth extracted, 231,213; cases of pyorrhoea, 12,791; 1,903 diseased jaw bones; 113,979 diseased root canals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is impossible to say which causes the more intense suffering and tears—earache or toothache. I have witnessed many a poor devil, with his handkerchief to the side of his face, crying and tears running down his cheeks, ’which could have been prevented. At Guam in October, 1921, seven sailors came from destroyers with aching and abscessed teeth, ’which had to be lanced and extracted; they had been at sea for some time, and had suffered from lack of timely care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One sailor from Connecticut had to have all of his front teeth extracted—disfiguring him and crippling his health; said he had been in the service one year and had never had his teeth even inspected. A marine from Montana had an abscessed tooth, followed by blood poison, nearly costing his life. .After one month, ill in the naval hospital, he was invalided to the States. Our dental surgeon said if the patient had been treated by a civilian dentist at San. Francisco (in the absence of enough navy dental surgeons), $2.00 would have obviated this serious illness. I have known many men to be forced to get leaves of absence from duty and go home to their own dentists at their own expense because they could not, get their teeth attended to otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From an exhaustive study of hundreds of cases accused of “malingering’, which obtains to the extent of an obsession, I have invariably found that if the case was properly investigated •—attended with patience—there was </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> real cause for complaint. It must be admitted that there is a certain class who will shirk if they get the chance; but they are not immune to fatigue and sickness, the inductions of which are plentiful. Such dastardly accusations reflect upon our own judgment; we accepted the lad “morally fit”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My opinion is that if properly handled the average boy will do his part, and from the viewpoint of morale it is the part of wisdom to put a few shirkers on the sick list rather than perpetrate the many disgraceful injustices which it has been my displeasure to witness. Of the endless cases coming under my observation the recitation of three is believed sufficient here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sailor from Massachusetts, ill, appealed to five medical officers to put him on the sick Hst, covering a period of two weeks, and was turned away—branded a “fakir”, He was found dead in his hammock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Due to tradition and through abuse of power I was placed under the command of a young medical officer who entered the service fresh from college, sixteen years my junior. I mention only one of his many blunders</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A marine whose home is in Utah came to the sick call for three weeks without receiving physical examination or bedside observation, and was returned to duty with a perfunctory dose of medicine. The young medico said to me, “That boy is a fakir.” I replied, “I do not agree with you, doctor; you have a sick man on your hands.” I had not made any examination but was governed by the facial expression,. which told the tale. The marine was engaged in manual labor in the tropical sun. I “took the bull by the horns”, disregarding written orders, and sent the depressed boy to the naval hospital, twelve miles distant on the Pacific, and received a reprimand from the medical officer in command for ignoring orders; which went over my head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ten days later the medical officers at the hospital-entered a diagnosis of insanity; and to see the patient walking about the naval hospital under the care of a marine guard who had a pistol strapped to his hip would remind one of a sheriff in charge of an outlaw instead of a patient on a naval hospital reservation—and a sickening sight it was. The patient was transferred to the States; and the receiving officer, or the sick boy’s family, didn’t know of the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On another occasion, and there were numberless ones like it, a marine appealed to me at the naval hospital, Guam, saying that he had no appetite and was weak. He was doing manual labor in the tropical sun. Examinations proved to be negative, but the complainant was underweight (so disastrous in the tropics), so I gave </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> the benefit of the doubt and put him on the sick list for observation; for which I was much criticised. Another medical officer, of the machine type, insulted my patient by calling him a “sea lawyer”, with whom I took vigorous issue. The patient developed tuberculosis. How do you suppose I would have felt had I returned the marine to duty, and he had developed the disease ■with the pick and shovel in his hands? This patient’s home was in Kansas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have been frequently requested by enlisted men to become their counsel; and concerning many of them I had evidence to prove that the blame rested elsewhere; and, knowing that I would have to call a spade a spade, I always declined. Solitary confinement of our selected subjects who deserve it, and who are physically equal to such incarceration, is bad enough; but to put a patient from a naval hospital in a steel cell because he refuses to do drudgery, depriving him of sunshine, a happy mind, exercise, and other conditions necessary to convalescence, is inconsistent with psychology, ability to command, and preventive medicine. A prison on a naval hospital reservation should be condemned as un-American. Mental strain has to do with insanity, and we have two such institutions in our midst for those who caved in, men whom we pronounced normal, mentally, when they were accepted into the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If our officers, learned in discipline, were to take individual interest instead of leaving the teachings to the non coms, things would be changed for the better. Dr. B. A. Nolan, U. S. Navy, proves my assertion, when he says in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Navy Medical Bulletin:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The petty officer may seek to impress his importanca on the recruit by filthy and obscene language; inflict disciplinary measures, when many of these men do not know the meaning of the word discipline; or bully and attempt to cowe them at times to cover his own inferiority complex. Men have been known to suffer excruciating pain from a tooth or abdominal condition because they are afraid to ask to whom they might go for relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I was detailed to a camp composed of 300 boys from Tennessee, under the command of a young Annapolis graduate. We were overtaken by several days of rain and cold weather, causing illness, on account of exposure. A boy became paralyzed from the hips down, and is to this May. There was only one building at camp, occupied by the officer and myself. I borrowed a stove and picked up drift wood and soon had a hot fire in my quarters. I then brought in the paralyzed boy on his cot and had about twenty other boys come in and remove their shoes and dry their feet. The young officer came in, ordered the boys out and accused me of lax discipline, which I resented by informing him that I had done my plain, duty.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark34"></a>From Our Canadian Correspondent</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE Dominion Forestry Branch has made its twenty-third annual distribution of seedlings and cuttings for shelter belts and wind breaks from its nurseries at Indian Head and Sutherland, for use on the prairie farms. During the shipping period of April 14th to May 1st, 2,470,000 seedlings, cuttings and transplants were sent out from Indian Head to 3,080 farmers, and 2,500,000 were distributed from Sutherland to 3,010 farmers. To date approximately 81,000,000 seedlings and cuttings of broad leaf trees and nearly 150,000,000 young, spruce and pine transplants have been distributed from the nurseries. This represents about 45,000 shelter belts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fanner values his farm at anything from $1000 to $5000 additional after a shelter belt is well grown. Planting trees gives a feeling of permanence to a proposition, as is illustrated by the story of the British soldier taken prisoner by the Germans in 1916. Tommy watched interestedly a group of Germans planting cabbage back of their lines. He inquired the purpose. The Germans told him they hoped to get a crop before the war ended. “That so?” said Tommy, “Well, you are bloomin’ optermists—-we was plantin’ acorns when I left!” It is stated by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dun’s Bulletin,</span><span class="font6"> quoting from a member of the Canadian Forestry Association:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In more than seven thousand miles of travel, we have yet to encounter a single farmer who has migrated from a well-treed farm. The secret of stablizing population on the prairies is closely identified with tree planting. Even in excessively dry districts, where migration was severe, the farmer with shelter belts managed to make a better living and certainly had no thought of quitting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">NE small dam in the golden river flowing into the United States from all over the world, has been placed in position by Canada. Arrangements have been entered into whereby Canadian gold mines may have their gold minted at the Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint and take payment in gold. This comes about as the result of an alteration in the exchange situation between Canada and the United States by which the Canadian dollar has come to par and above it. The minting is done without charge. In the first six months of 1925 production of gold was $17,034,480 as against $14,475,741 for the corresponding period in 1924. Canada is steadily forging to the front in gold production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Canada’s fisheries are also becoming one of her principal harvests. The first six months of 1925 showed a total value of $9,779,620 as compared with $9,155,438 for the corresponding period in 1924. Much research is now going on to find improved ways and means of marketing the fish. Freezing, one of the simplest and commonest methods in use, is being investigated; and already it has been clearly demonstrated that fish frozen with great rapidity, almost instantaneously in fact, is virtually as firm and undeteriorated when thawed as when first caught. This fast-freezing method is now perfected and is expected to revolutionize this phase of the industry. A gross business of $100,000,000 a year is looked for in the near future by the use of this and other improved methods of handling the catch.</span></p>

Although the goat is not so pleasant an animal to have around as some other domestic varieties, nevertheless he has some good points, among which is his immunity to tuberculosis. There is no such thing as tubercular goat’s milk, and as a food it is much richer than cow’s milk. The meat is considered the equal of mutton by many owners who use it constantly on the table.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">HE </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Veterans Review,</span><span class="font6"> a paper sold by unemployed veterans in Toronto, does not seem to feel kindly toward the churches that &quot;mothered” the soldiers during the Great War. 'A leading article is headed, ‘'‘The Rusty Church Door,” and the following paragraphs are typical:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the war organized religion, as a whole, not only did not take the unpopular side, but quite definitely and openly took the popular side. Many of the clergy and ministers of churches, not content merely to support the war, actually added fuel to the flames of hatred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would doubtless have been unpopular even for those who supported the war to suggest that we must, still struggle with the temptations to hate, to believe evil, and to exact revenge; but if the churches felt bound to support the war, were they not at least bound to do this ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Or, when &quot;peace” came, was it not then at least possible for a great Christian campaign to take place in. favor of a peace based, on the principles of Christ— &quot;If thine enemy hunger feed him: if he. thirst give him drink” ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have yet to learn, that there was any great movement in organized religion against the blockade, or in favor of something a little nearer to righteousness than the Treaty of Versailles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Can it be denied that occasionally a strike has been justified in Ilie industrial world? Can anyone look upon the history of industrialism and not see that at least sometimes the complaints of the workers (with regard to child-labor, wages, conditions, and so on) have been justified ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Has organized religion as a whole ever said so, or ever publicly supported the workers on these occasions ? I do not know of one instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was the same in the struggle for the freedom of women. Someone in my hearing put a question to </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font4">clergyman on the platform as to why the clergy in general didn’t come out more openly on the side of the women. He replied with some surprise, “Well, I suppose because they don’t want to have bottles thrown at them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I, in equal surprise, said that I could not imagine such a consideration weighing with our Lord for an instant, and that after all the clergy are supposed to be representing Him in the twentieth century. Result-mutual surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet the churches can fight if they like. They have fought one another like tigers over Education Bills, and doubtless will again. They have fought one another over the question of a State Church in Ireland, in Wales, and some day no doubt will fight in England. They have even fought (the Wesleyans and Anglicans) over whether the former have a right to address their ministers as “reverend”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I do not mean to suggest that if the churches really took up the battle and ‘were not ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified’ they would become popular; certainly they would not. But that, to Christian people, surely can’t be the point. What they would . become, I am quite sure, is alive. To live people, life itself is always attractive enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy wouldn’t then have to discuss how to get people to come to church; the real Christians would come because they want to be together. When they came together they would have that intense sense of fellowship that comes to those who are up against great things— </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">whether the soldier in the trenches or the conscientious objector in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They would come because they want life, and they would find it there. When they took up an unpopular cause, because they believed it. was on that side that their Master would be found, their courage and faith, would give them a power out of all proportion to their numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When they took up a popular cause that is just (and after all, with human nature as decent as it is, just causes are not always unpopular) they would bring into it the idealism that even just causes easily lose when they are too popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course I know that there are clergymen and ministers who take these risks and do these things, and are sometimes popular and sometimes not. I offer them all the more hearty tribute of admiration because I realize what a dead weight against them is the attitude of official organized religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because it has so rarely been on the side of the weak and the oppressed, the under dog doesn’t trust them very readily; and those who are fighting his battle, don’t readily trust them either. That is hard luck, but anyone can see why it happens.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font6">UT one hundred years ago the working field of the astronomer was quite limited. His instruments and methods of research did not allow him to pass beyond the frontiers of our closest spheres, the planetary system of which our sun is the center. Although the spatial arrangements and movements of these few earthlike bodies, traveling in elliptical orbits round their common centre, the sun, and shining forth in borrowed light, were at that time relatively well known, yet a hollow globe with a diameter of 9000 million kilometers would have taken in the whole reliably explored world a century ago. The swift rays of light, traveling at the rate of 186,300 miles a second, could cover the w’hole explored region in eight hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Information concerning the fixed stars in the universe was meagre and the facts obscure until comparatively recent years; it was merely known that their number must be very large. But the universe became larger with the bigger and more powerful instruments available; and now the number of fixed stars must be counted by the millions, although 'with the naked eye but a few thousand can be perceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nor had the fact escaped the attention of the early explorers that the more they magnified the mysterious nebula, the Milky Way, the denser its light appeared, and that the pale glimmer of that band of light was dissolved into very many single sparks of light, separate stars, in the larger instruments. It was also conjectured that these stars might be extremely distant suns; but there were then no proofs for such an hypothesis, the distances being entirely unknown, and all attempts to ascertain these had repeatedly failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was not until the year 1837 that the distance to any fixed star was successfully computed ; and then by one stroke, the limits of the accessible universe were immensely extended. The surmisings of farseeing explorers of long </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ago</span><span class="font6"> had become true; the fixed stars were suns indeed, and it was but their immense distances from the earth that made these mighty luminous bodies of the universe recede into insignificant points of light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For years, decades, centuries the ultra-rapid</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">rays of light from these distant stars must have been on their way, untiringly rushing through their 300,000 kilometers every second, to bring us the news and proof of the existence of the measurable suns. However the then extremely difficult task of ascertaining the distance to these mighty bodies was successful in but a few isolated cases. For the remaining immense host of stars all efforts of measurement proved unavailing;: the results merely indicated that it was quite impossible to bridge the inconceivably vast space with the methods of measuring then known, and: that many of these stars must be farther distant than ten or even a hundred light years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Camera, Photometer and Spectroscope</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE second half of the nineteenth century  -  put. the astronomer in-possession of three important expedients, with the aid of which it has been .possible to bring a large number of questions concerning the fixed stars nearer to solution; questions which a hundred years ago no one would scarcely have dared to ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first of these expedients is the photographic camera, which has unexpectedly enhanced our view of the heavens. The sensitized plate, in connection with huge powerful lenses or mirrors, showed us a world of a size and profusion of which the eye, even after scanning the heavens with the aid of large telescopes,- had had no inkling. It may actually be said that today thousands of millions of celestial objects can be seen in the picture on the photographic plate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, photography teaches us to look upon our universe not merely as a profuse but otherwise rather monotonous collection of so many suns. It shows the vault of heaven full of diversity and variety, abounding in systems and nebulous formations of greatest richness and rarest shapes—curious rings, flaming globes and gigantic wheels of fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second highly important expedient is the photometer, an instrument which enables us to measure with great precision the volume of light reaching us from a given star. Such measurings of the varying degrees of brightness give us valuable information for computing distances in the universe, and also reveal special </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">495</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">characteristics of certain members of the star systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The third expedient, and one by which man has succeeded in deciphering the language of the ray of light, is. that wonderful apparatus known as the spectroscope. In this incomparable instrument the ray of light tells us of the chemical construction of a far-away celestial body, of the conditions (pressure and temperature) of the matter existing there, and finally gives us information about the -movements of the stars which otherwise would surely have remained hidden to us forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Equipped with all these ingenious instruments the exploration of the world of fixed stars was taken in hand by astronomers. Up'to now a vast amount of material for observation has been collected and, with data still increasing daily, the full tabulation and elaboration of it will occupy generations. A number of important results have however even now, like ripe fruits, fallen into our lap, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First of all, it has been shown with all certainty that a deeper meaning is inherent in that filmy veil commonly known as the Milky Way which spans, as a tremendous ring, our starry universe. Everything in it is of the highest orderliness. In fact all suns accessible to us, including our own sun, belong to the Milky Way. It is as one inconceivably tremendous building, the separate stones of which are suns. Probably more than a thousand million suns, all similar to ours, belong to this gigantic galaxy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immensely vast is the space occupied by this wondrous family of stars. Up to a few years ago we had to depend on pure estimates as to the magnitude of this great expanse. It was thought that the diameter of this gigantic building is about 30,000 light years, and one hardly 'dared to pronounce this enormous figure. Bear in mind that a ray of light requires but little over eight minutes to cover the entire distance from the sun to this earth; and one light year is the distance a ray of light can travel in a year’s time I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Appearance of course teaches that the Milky Way system must evidently fill a flat disc-shaped space. The studding of this space with stars must, however, follow very intricate rules. The sight of every nebula is that of a manifold torn and rifted star cloud, showing that the stars within the ring must be distributed quite irregularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spiral Universes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A^ANY years ago the Dutch astronomer 1VX Easton came to the conclusion that the Milky Way building is a spiral-shaped structure. According to his .conception there extends from a central point two gigantic spiral arms, embracing the center point in vast and ever widening windings. Our sun hebelieved to be situated not far from the center, which he placed in the constellation Cygnus. Hence from our point of vantage the double spiral would appear as a girdle or closed ring around the whole celestial vault, exactly as the Milky Way does appear. The existence of other spiral nebulae led Easton to the assumption of a spiral Milky Way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If we photograph the starry sky with the aid of modern instruments, the plates show in many places small clouds of light of distinctly spiral-shaped structure. These formations, scattered over the celestial vault in immense numbers, are called by the astronomers “spiral nebulse”. It is estimated that with a mirror telescope of only one meter opening about a million of these “tiny” nebulae are revealed. With still larger instruments there would surely be seen correspondingly more. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The existence of the same spiral nebulae which had led Easton to his views on the Milky Way constituted, in the minds of others, a hindrance to the acceptance of his theory. Should the Milky Way really be viewed as a large spiral then it was obvious to them that we should look upon all the other (to us) tiny spiral nebuke as structures of a similar kind—as other Milky Way systems. However, as these nebulae appear to us very small and extremely faint, such immense distances had to be assumed for them by Easton as to deter almost anyone; therefore the “gaseous” nebular theory continued to be held. But the large problem of the “World Isle” theory was persistent, and it continued to give astronomers much food for thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much of the material for observation collected in the course of the following years spoke in favor of the Easton idea, although other facts were seemingly against it. But important above all was the information eventually supplied by the spectroscope, to the effect that the spiral nebulae, which we encounter in a large variety of shapes throughout the universe, do not consist of gaseous masses such as might constitute the building material out of which new worlds and suns are formed, but that they really consist of individual stars in immense groups, like the Milky Way, which we are unable to perceive separately because of their incomprehensible distance from the earth. In the clearest and largest spiral nebulae new stars turn up from time to time, just as is the case in our own Milky Way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Researches of the last few years have shown astronomers that they are not to be dismayed by unheard-of distances in space. Modern ingenuity has placed in our hands methods which under certain circumstances allow us to measure the most gigantic distances with, some degree of certainty. There are above all the researches of the American astronomer Shapley, who has succeeded in ascertaining the distances to some of these spiral-shaped starry clouds. He has definitely penetrated the depth of space to the extent of more than 200,000 light years, which is nearly ten times farther than our hitherto vague estimates of the expanse of our entire Milky Way. One of the methods which he used in ascertaining these incomprehensible distances may be briefly explained here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Astronomer’s Yardstick</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font6">E HAVE known for a long time that a large number of stars, many thousands in fact, do not give a uniform light, but show a periodical change in their degrees of brightness. These are called changeable or variable stars. The degree of the fluctuation in brightness may differ widely with different stars. With many variables the changes in brightness take place at regular intervals, and we speak of the time between .their changes of light as their “periods”. The period is the time from one maximum of brightness to th'e next. With some the periods may not be regular but may be of widely differing durations, from a few hours to several years. There is one group of changeable stars, the Delta-Cepheus group, named after their chief representative, the star Delta in Cepheus, which is quite distinctive. It has been discovered after many observations that the duration of the period and the absolute degree of brightness of each star in this group stand in a fixed relationship to each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now in order to classify the stars according to their illuminative powers we imagine all of them as placed at the same distance, viz., 3.25 light years. This, on the astronomer’s yardstick, is called one star-distance. The intensity of light which any given star shows at this theoretical distance is easily ascertained. This is called its absolute size or absolute brightness. With the class of variables mentioned above we can ascertain from the observed durations of their periods the degree of brightness of each. After determining the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">absolute</span><span class="font6"> degree of brightness we then simply compare it with the brightness at which the star actually appears to us in the instrument, called its </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">apparent</span><span class="font6"> degree of brightness: and this enables us easily to compute its distance from the earth. In fixing this distance we have alawys to bear in mind that the degree of brightness decreases in proportion to the square of the distance. Thus a star at two star-distances (6.5 light years) would send us but one-quarter of its “absolute volume of light, and at four star-distances oei one-sixteenth of its original volume of light,, and so on. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1925 the American astronomer Hubble, of Mt Wilson Observatory, California, succeeded in gaining firm support for the aforementioned world isle theory by extensive researches carried out with respect to two of the largest, and very likely the nearest, spiral nebulae—the Andromeda nebula and the Triangle nebula. The most powerful instrument in the world, a mirror telescope with an opening of two and one-half meters, was used for this purpose. He was successful in photographically dissolving the outer windings of these two nebulae into countless single stars, thereby splendidly confirming the aforementioned spectroscopical findings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If we should assume that all the stars of our Milky Way radiate with about the same illuminative power, none being any brighter than our sun, we would have to push back the Milky Way into the remote, regions of space for 1,000,000 light years, i. e., at the speed of light (186, 300 miles &amp;&nbsp;second) for one million years before its degree of brightness would be reduced to such a tiny speck of light as the stars of the Andromeda nebula now<sup>T</sup> appear to us. In other ■words, the distance between the Andromeda and the Milky Way nebulae is about one million light years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prof. Hubble has found in the Andromeda and Triangle nebulae quite a number of changeable stars of the Delta-Cepheus class. From the periods of their change of light their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">absolute </span><span class="font6">degrees of brightness were obtained, and by the duration of their exposure at the mirror their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">apparent</span><span class="font6"> degrees of brightness are shown; then from these facts their distance from us can be approximated. This method gives about the same distance (approximately one million light years) as other methods employed, thus corroborating the result. As already mentioned, we here speak of the two largest and apparently nearest spiral iiebuke. The hundreds of thousands of smaller nebula? may also be found to be gigantic universes located at still greater distances from our own. The importance of these scientific achievements can hardly be estimated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The humble threc-inch field glass of Galileo and Kepler brought us a deeper view of the planets; the improved telescope, spectroscope, photometer and sensitized plate of the nineteenth century bridged the distance from sun to sun; but today, at the first quarter mark of the twentieth century, we are on the threshold of an epoch in which even these enormous distances are not acceptable as limits for the human eye to span. The modem astronomer is now stretching his yardstick across the dark spaces of millions of light years, from universe to universe. Step by step the distance from Milky Way to Milky Way is being conquered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[What is man in the sight of this? We stand in awe of the greatness of our Creator, who made all these things. Verily He could put the question to. Job: “Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion ? Canst thou bring forth Maz-zaroth in his season ? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons ? Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven ? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?”—Job 38: 31-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even today man is merely beginning to peep out into the universe, and the vastness of its expanse is just dawning upon him. Truly, “the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.”—’ Psalm 19:1.]</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Breathe Freely and Eat Less </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">e.</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> Hunter</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">}</span><span class="font6">N THE Golden Age of October 7th, 1925, there appeared an excellent article by Mrs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Andrew J. Holmes, under the caption “The Value of Fresh Air”. However, in the interest of truth I would like to call attention to an erroneous statement in said article, found in the last sentence of the first paragraph, as follows: “One would never have a cold if he did not breathe foul air.” Please observe, the point there made is not, If one would breathe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in the ■proper way</span><span class="font6"> he would never have a cold, but “One would never have a cold if he did not breathe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">foul</span><span class="font6"> air”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is a sweeping statement and does not express the exact truth. It is the easiest thing in the world, after seeing a great truth to then ascribe every unfavorable condition to the disregarding of it. Breathing is a first requisite of life, and the deeper the breath and the purer the air the better the health. But will pure air, breathed day and night, keep one from having colds ? Let us see if this is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are living on a Florida peninsula, a narrow strip of land about eight miles long, jutting out into a large lake. Breezes from the northwest sweep across this big body of water in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">winter months and temper the cold from the : west. About forty-five miles away the great Atlantic Ocean contributes its quota of fresh moving air. The soft balmy breezes of s</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font6">er are the prevailing type. The climate is so mild that the kiddies go barefoot the year round, with the result that the sun paints their legs and feet a nut brown. Old Sol shows his smiling face .....</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nearly every day, a gray sky is a rare exception. Kind nature has also provided an abundance of shade along this sandy ridge. There are the cypress, the rubber, the ash and the palm trees to shelter from the too hot rays of the sun at noonday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would be difficult to imagine a more ideal place for fresh air and the great out-of-door life. Nor do people living here nullify it by keeping their houses air-tight. Most of the dwellings are only shacks. Nearly every weatherboard has a crack. As for windows they are generally minus, just a canvass curtain to let . down when it is a little too cool mornings and evenings. You could not dodge fresh air in a place like this if you tried. Day and night it circles around you, pure, fresh, moving, vital fluid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now -we. come to an important question: Are the people who live continuously in this current, of fresh air free from colds? No, we do not find it so; this ailment is common around here. Furthermore, what are called ‘'•risings” or boils, are frequent, both among adults and children, in summer as well as in the cooler months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fallen human nature has no liking for hard truths, especially if these demand the giving up of old established habits and the denying of self. If we are real truth-seekers we will face the facts and endeavor to attain the ideal, the better way of living. I recently saw a disgusting picture which well illustrated the main cause of colds. A child of about three years of age here had a “terrible cold”. Two streams of yellow mucus were constantly flowing from its nostrils, and it was with difficulty that the child breathed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The little hands of this child were full of food ; one tiny palm held a sweet potato, the other held a biscuit made of white flour, smeared over with pork gravy. I did not need to enquire the cause of the “terrible cold”. It was self-evident. Please bear in mind that this child had been living in a current of fresh air day and night since birth, and was still so living. Foul air was not the cause of its cold. We shall have to look elsewhere for an explanation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The trouble arose from a superabundance of mucus-forming foods, such as white flour products, potatoes and cereals; then a woeful lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. I quote a noted dietician on this point: “The natural mineral elements in the blood take up the oxygen, therefore right diet and proper breathing go together.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The yellow mucus indicated too much fat in the diet, causing decomposition and pus, which. nature was throwing out in her inimitable way. When we have a lot of rubbish in our yard, if we are tidy we will rake it together, set fire to it and get rid of the unsightly heap. So nature has her bonfires. A cold is a fever, and a fever is nature’s means of burning up accumulated rubbish forced upon her. If the poisons were not eliminated severe chronic sickness would ensue, and possibly death. The beneficent laws of nature are ever at work for the weal of mankind, but alas, how many of her children in their ignorance misinterpret her signals of distress and cure I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the unenlightened mind a fever must be suppressed for the reason that it is considered the cause of the sickness; but the reverse is true. Fever is present because of infection resulting from toxins in the system, which nature is endeavoring to burn up and east out in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the influenza epidemic of 1918 two cases were under observation which may be interesting to relate. Two women of about the same age and equal constitutional power became sick, with all the usual symptoms of that illness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lady A had great faith in the masters of the medical profession and thought that drug stores were veritable “life-saving stations”. Acting upon her belief she sent for the family physician and took the regulation serum treatment. She suffered much and was confined to the house-for three weeks before nature recovered from the attack and the shock of the unbidden food and drugs forced upon a suffering Body while in the throes of disease. She also had the added burden of fees for doctors and drugs, extracted from a slim purse which could ill bear the strain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lady B 'was better informed as to the ways of nature. She well knew that the only power that could cure her was within, the body being a self-repairing machine. She resolved to give nature a free hand. This was the plan followed: All food was stopped and water 'was taken only as desired; a wide-open window admitting the fresh frosty air (in a northern clime) was the order day and night; warmth was provided by light woolen blankets; simple means were used to encourage the eliminating organs to act; the room, was kept quiet and restful; the mind of the patient was cheerful; she realized that the -best physician, Dr. Nature, had charge of her case, The results were most gratifying. By the evening of the third day'all disease symptoms had disappeared. The next day, the fourth, the patient was normal and ready for her first meal, at noon, which was eaten with relish., while lady A continued to suffer for three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who will not say that lady B had the better physician? No long weary weeks of confinement to the house; no unbidden food; no drugs to handicap nature; no doctor and drug bills to pay, all of which was the experience of lady A and of thousands of others of like mind who are groping in darkness, not knowing of the power of nature to heal if given a chance. Surely from the knowledge of truth flow many blessings. “Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free”—free from error, superstition and darkness. This applies to God's book of nature as well as to His revealed Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To return to the subject: I would suggest that the best 'way to avoid colds and other disease symptoms is to quit throwing into the blood stream by way of the alimentary canal too much food material, especially foods of the heavier kind such as proteins, starches and fats. Wrong combinations and an unbalanced diet will also work havoc. If these errors of diet are indulged in. all the fresh air in the world will not prevent colds and other ailments. In other words: Study diet, eat less and eat. right, exercise well and breathe deeply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chemistry of the chyle, as it passes through the alimentary canal is just as important for the health of the body as is the oxygenation of the blood as it passes through the lungs. “We are now seeing out of obscurity and out of darkness” and are at last learning something of the proper care of our bodies and their requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ever since the days that the gates of Eden closed against the first human pair, cutting them off from the life-giving trees, death has reigned, and life everlasting on earth has never been considered possible from the human standpoint. In due time this glorious hope is revived and mankind will have the opportunity of feeding on the natural foods as provided by the Creator; and then, to the obedient, death will be no more.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A Fundamental in Health </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Isaac L, Peebles, M. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">UE Savior declared a fundamental in health which should be rigidly respected by each and every one, when he said; “They that are whole [sound and healthy] need not a physician.”. (Luke 5:31) He was the Son of God, and hence He knew that of which He declared and needed no instruction from any one. Besides, He was the greatest Healer the world ever had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From His words we learn this fundamental: No healthy person needs a doctor; and too, that it is quite unwise for a healthy person to ran after a doctor to be made sick. We also learn that a doctor is much out of place who hounds or, when allorved, forces a healthy person to become sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One who is healthy, and then allows himself to be made sick in order to be made healthy, is as foolish as he who declares that he is a Christian but who, to make sure that he is a Christian becomes a sinner; or he who is sober, to make.......</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sure that he is sober, becomes a drunkard. Any one can see how foolish such a course is. And why not see as easily, therefore, how foolish one is who is healthy but who, to make sure that he is healthy, becomes diseased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From all this, we learn something of the want of wisdom on the part of those who allow their blood to be diseased by vaccinations and vaccinations; in other words, to swap his health for a 'diseased condition. Many a one has been wrecked in health by such ignorance and heartlessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From henceforth and for ever let each one remember that health is next to Bible religion, in worth and importance, and hence be sure to keep it as such and never swap it for any disease whatsoever. “They that are whole need not a physician.”-—Luke 5: 31.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Commendatory of the Bible Students</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the countries where the International</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bible Students meet with strong 'opposition and persecution, being ridiculed from the pulpit and by the press, is Greece. Mr. Stamos Branias, a man of some prominence in Greece, for a few months has been making New York City his home. A few months ago he wrote a communication to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eleftheros Typos {Free Press')</span><span class="font6"> of Athens, Greece, in defence of the Bible Students. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eleftheros Typos</span><span class="font6"> is said to be one of the greatest newspapers published in Greece, and Mr. Stamos Branias is associated with it in an editorial capacity. The article is headed: “Transatlantic Items—The Bible Students” and is printed on the front page. Below we publish a translation of it, in full:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible Students</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260505_files/g_E_19260505-7.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">AVING awakened to the fact, I have rubbed my eyes. I saw here an organization—we might better call it an association—back of which there are no collection agents—The International Bible Students Association. In the said association there are no long fingers decked with sparkling counterfeit diamonds, pick-pocketing the credulous and the simple. It owns no church buildings and has no trumpets, tambourines nor banners fringed with golden tassels. It is grouped under the intellectual white standard of Love, and upon its lips blossoms the smile of meekness and kindness. Blessed be the covering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a tattered Athenian journal, that has crossed the Atlantic in a trunk with a friendly gift, I have read the sneers and taunts launched against the Bible Students in Athens; and also the information that this Association has its headquarters established here [in New York]. In view of the fact that the Association has its main office here, the silence of the American press regarding this association, whose members are numbered by thousands, had aroused my curosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I was firmly convinced that the English, as well as the Greek press here, is indifferent to anything that is lacking food for thinking people. I began to investigate for something great and exceptional. To my astonishment I have found people lowly in heart and pure in thought. I have found just good, humble Christian people,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have further found among them judges who have forsaken the judicial bench and lowered themselves to humble occupations because they could not falsify and do injustice. I have found characters like diamonds, and have looked- upon countenances full of radiant hopes. Where ? In the midst of a great cage of ravenous beasts, in an asphyxiating atmosphere where everything else is but. falsity and hypocrisy, and where almost all mankind are actuated by their depraved appetites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But, we may ask, what do these Bible Students believe, anyhow? Do they not believe that the dead will be resurrected, that those that have done good will live for ever, and that those who have done evil will be obliterated? Do these people not believe in freedom, in equality, in the brotherhood of men, in virtue and in love ? Do they not believe in the teachings of Christ, uncontaminated from the deluded teachings of the clergy who are garbed with the cloak of ignorance and superstition ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible Students do not believe in the many colored banners that are symbols of violence, oppression, injustice, exploitation and defrauding of the weak under the influence of the mighty. They believe and hold the standard of peace, of love, of equality, of freedom, and the brotherhood of men in one flock under one Shepherd —under the law of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do they believe in utopias, in ridiculous things, </span><span class="font5">if </span><span class="font4">you please?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What do we care as to what they believe or what they disbelieve? Rather, what they, do should interest us. We ought to care; and it should be an interesting duty to know that there are no examples of Bible Students who have ever violated city ordinances or the law of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This Association has many myriads of members in America; and of these many thousands not even one has a police record, and no judge ever has to question any Bible Student as to his name or where he lives, in this land where each day that goes by draws its many victims of terrible crimes, and the rising sun of the morning reveals the shameful acts of the previous night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the Greeks here of whom I am proud, because I too am Greek, belong to the Bible Students Association. All are working men, because the basis of their individual morality and the foundation of justice is, to them, work. The consumer must produce. </span><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font4">consumer who does not produce </span><span class="font5">of necessity is a thief j </span><span class="font4">and no thief is an honest mans &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Once a Greek business man. decided to paint his store, and asked one of his friends to furnish him with an experienced worker. When the painter came the - next day to work, the employer recognized the man in working clothes as one whom he formerly knew was ..a thief. He did not discharge the man but employed him, yet while at work kept his eye fixed upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The workman suspected his employer’s attitude, and in soft tone said to him: “Be not disturbed, and do not watch me. You may be sure that I will do the work better than anybody else, I will not cheat you. I am not the man you formerly knew. Now I am a changed man.” The thief of yesterday had become a Bible Student. and denied the old man, his former self. He had crucified the old man and his evil deeds. The hands that used to crack locks and steal jewels were armed with the implements of honest toil and the rule of justice. He moved only to work, to do good, to practise mercy, to comfort and to pray and serve his Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a striking phenomenon that the Bible Students here present.. Striking and unbelievable is the contrast of the man of today with the man of yesterday. Men who lived by suspicious occupations—smugglers, gamblers, thieves, criminals, perverts, vagabonds without families and without friends, have became examples of honorable, working, and moral men as a result of the Bible Students’ teachings. They became the examples of good householders, examples of meekness, patience, and truthfulness: and..their homes are like those of Philemon and Baucis. This miracle of re-baptism must be credited to the International Bible Students Association, which has no cashiers nor collectors, neither banners, nor drums, nor criers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">RAVELING east or west through the northern part of the State of Arizona you keep very close along the Old Trails Highway in touch with natural wonders. Here and there you may be obliged to detour for a few miles to see a spot or two well worth while, and you will be. well repaid for this little extra inconvenience by looking upon nature’s handiwork such as the Petrified Forest, the Painted Desert (of which we have several),-Canyon Diablo, the Buried Meteor, Walnut Canyon, with the old cliff dwellings of centuries ago; and ever so •many other wonderful spots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the greatest and grandest of all wonders on this Western Hemisphere is the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, in northern Arizona. This wonderland is easily reached from the highway by branching off at cither Williams, going east, or Main, going west. By entering at the one place you can come out at the other, and continue your journey without losing much, mileage. The rim of the canyon can readily be reached in less than three hours by auto from the Old Trails Highway. There are camp grounds, where you can pitch your tent. You will especially enjoy a drive to the west, along the rim to Hermit’s Best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of us, regardless of our location on the planet, have on bright summer evenings sat gazing and wondering at the bright shiny stars in the blue firmament of heaven, whose magnitude is incomprehensible. But here at the Grand Canyon you stand on the rim or frame of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">great picture and behold in astonishment the - ........-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">work of centuries of ceaseless carving by the - y-mighty hand of Nature. Deeper and deeper it lias gone, hewing’ out to grander and greater size multitudinous formsations'compared to magnificent temples and cathedrals of indescribable beauty. Here and there are round pinnacles, ' p pointing their peaks far above the bottom of the canyon, and set in various color schemes- — such as only Nature could paint. Old rose color is predominant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This marvelous picture you see only by looking down instead of up. It is truly a favorable ~ ~ comparison to the great expanse above us. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado is second only to God’s glory in the heavens. Then you may look across the horizon to the north and see little rain clouds dropping ou t heaven’s blessings into the rim of the canyon, pouring out their refreshing moisture and filling a little brook that, will in a short run empty its clear ripples into the muddy waters of the Colorado.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Should the reader contemplate a trip to the -Grantl Canyon he should make use of the government’s National Park Service,'Washington, D. C. Request them to mail you &quot;Rules and Regulations, Grand Canyon National . Park, Arizona.” Read the book before you start out. I mention this because I am of the opinion that the valuable information at our hand through the National Park Service is not taken proper advantage of by the majority, for the purpose for which it is established.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Hopes of the Telegraphers </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By An Old Timer ■</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6">N OPERATOR’S life is chock full of hope from the time he learns telegraphy until the day he either dies or gets too old to work. He hopes and looks forward to the time when he will get out of telegraphing. Most operators are gray at thirty or thirty-five. They do not live long, as their work is so confining and hard on the nerves that it breaks them down when they should be in their prime. The average person thinks an operator has nothing to do but draw his breath and his pay, but the truth of the matter is he is the whole works and runs the whole business. Operators are paid less than any railroad craft except unskilled Negro laborers. The Negroes that work on the section get from $3 to $5, depending on location, and the operators get from $4 to $5 depending also on location. The reason the telegraph profession pays bo little is because boys can do the work, A boy sixteen years old is a better operator than a man of fifty. A boy begins telegraphing at sixteen and draws the same salary that his father draws at fifty years of age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">[Radioeast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6">FTER the death of Jacob his sons continued to reside in the land of Egypt. While 'Joseph lived and ruled, the Israelites were well treated and prospered. But the time had come for a change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.” (Genesis 50: 24-26) “Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.”— Exodus 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This new Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, dealt wickedly with the Israelites.' He caused the babes to be killed. Moses was born; and the Lord miraculously preserved him and caused him. to be nourished and brought up in the house of the king. Moses, learning of the promises made to his forefathers and seeing his brethren persecuted and ill-treated, rather than to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh and enjoy the pleasures of the great kingdom chose to suffer affliction with his own people. He forsook Egypt and sought to know and to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The afflictions of the Israelites increased under the wicked rulership of the Egyptian king. God called to Moses and said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. . . . And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters ; for I know their sorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amor-ites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”—Exodus 3: 6-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the Lord spoke unto Moses and told him to appear before the king of Egypt and demand the release of the Israelites. The Lord had appeared unto Abraham, Isaac and Jacob by the name of God Almighty; but now’ for the first time He appears as Jehovah, and He says to Moses: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, 'wherein they were strangers. And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.”—Exodus 6: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pharaoh .continued to increase the burdens of the Israelites. God. visited the various plagues upon the Egyptians. Still the king refused to permit Israel to go. Then came the plague of the first-borns. This was the time of the institution of the Passover. It marked the beginning of time with the Israelites. The Lord commanded that on the tenth day of the^first month each family should take a lamb which must be without blemish, a male of the first year. The lamb should be kept up until the fourteenth day of the same month, on which day it should be killed and the blood of the lamb sprinkled on the two.sideposts and the lintels of the door of the house of the family. Then the lamb,should be roasted with fire and eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; and the family eating thereof should have their loins girded, shoes on their feet and staff in hand; that at midnight of that day, when the angel of the Lord should pass through the land of Egypt and smite with death the first-born both of man and beast in Egypt, the first-born of the Israelites would be spared provided they had sprinkled the blood upon the door as directed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The families of Israel obeyed this command, and thus showed their faith in God’s promise; and their first-born vmre spared from death. On that fateful night the Lord smote with death the first-born of the households of Egypt, from the king to the humblest servant. There was a great cry in Egypt, and now the king and the people thrust out the Israelites. The Israelites had borrowed from the Egyptians their silver, their gold and their raiment. The descendants of Israel, or Jacob, had now grown to upward of 600,000 people; and these on foot marched to the Red Sea. When the king had bemoaned the fate of his first-born for a time, then he summoned his army and followed after the Israelites to slay them.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">B04</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">When Moses and Aaron had appeared before the king and requested that the Israelites be permitted to go and worship their God, Pharaoh said: “Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.” (Exodus 5:2) When the Egyptians had oppressed hard the Israelites God said unto Moses: “And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemem” (Exodus 14: 18) God then went before the camp of Israel and shielded them by a cloud and pillar of fire. The Lord commanded Moses to stretch forth his hand over the sea; and by a strong east wind the Lord caused the sea to go back so that the Israelites passed through the Red Sea on dry land. When the Egyptians started to follow after them they were engulfed in the sea and were destroyed. God thus demonstrated to the Israelites that He was their God, their shield and their protector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When they were safely on the other side of the sea Moses and the children of Israel sang a song of praise unto Jehovah: “The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.”—Exodus 15: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jehovah now began to teach the Israelites lessons of faith. Their miraculous deliverance from the hands of their enemies should have been sufficient to establish their faith in God. Faith and faithfulness is one of the hardest lessons that man has to learn. According to one’s faith is his reward and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">At Mount Sinai</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">N THE third month after the Israelites were delivered from the Egyptians they came to the wilderness of Sinai and pitched their camp at the base of Mount Sinai. At the invitation of Jehovah Moses vrent up into the mountain that God might communicate with him and arrange for the ratification of the covenant which had been made in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A covenant is a solemn agreement made between two or more parties upon a sufficient consideration, in which both parties agree to do or not to do certain things. In the law covenant ratified at Mount Sinai God promised to do certain things, and the Israelites agreed to do all that God proposed unto them. The Lord spoke through Moses, the mediator for Israel. God there' promised the Israelites that if they would be faithful to their agreement they should be unto Him a holy nation.—Exodus 19: 3-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shaft thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the Lord told Moses to prepare the people, for on the third day thereafter He would come down and give unto them the law. The people were assembled at the foot of Mount Sinai; and on the morning of the third day, amidst thunders and lightnings and while thick clouds hung over the mountain, the voice of a trumpet sounded exceeding loud and all the mountain quaked so that the people trembled with fear; and then the Lord spoke unto them. .Amidst these great convulsions of the earth and the elements, God through Moses gave unto the Israelites the law, the fundamental portion of which is set out in the Scriptures as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the cb.il-dren unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shaft not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“'Honour thy father and thy mother ; that thy days may be long’ upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt not kill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt not commit adultery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt not steal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife,, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. And the people stood afar off: and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and ’ shall sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.”-—Exodus 2°: 1-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a record of the divers statutes and ordinances which God gave to Israel the reader is referred to Exodus, chapters twenty-one and twenty-two. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But many ask: Why should God make a covenant with the people of Israel? The answer is: God had now organized the Israelites into a nation for His purposes. He had promised that through the line of Judah should come the great Messiah, to whom the people should be gathered, and who would administer to them the blessi ngs according to the promise which God had made . to Abraham. Of course God knew.the weaknesses of men and knew that the Israelites would now , be the special target of the enemy; but that the law would be unto the Jews a teacher or school- -master to keep them separate and distinct from other peoples of the earth and prepare them to receive the great Messiah in due time. The . law also served to teach them the real significance of the sacrifices which they were caused to perform and which in due time they would fully understand. The sacrifices of animals were merely types and shadows, showing that better things would follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is observed that of all things stated in the law that which is made the most prominent is that the people should worship Jehovah God . and should have no other gods beside Him. Why is that feature of the law made so prominent* If Jehovah God is all powerful and is the per-sonifieation of love, why should it be necessary for Him to make such a provision in His law® , Did Jehovah God make this law for a selfish purpose, that He might have the worship of the people? No; God did not make this law for a selfish purpose. He made it for the special bene- ' fit of the Jews and also for the ultimate benefit of all men. The proper answers to the above questions are very essential to an understanding of God’s specific dealings with Israel and of the general blessings He purposes for all -mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemy's Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TT IS recorded in the book of Jou (38:4-7) ■’L that when God laid the foundations of the earth as a habitation for man the Morning Stars sang together for joy. The Holy Scriptures show that the term Morning Stars refers to two mighty beings of heaven; namely, Michael (the Logos) and Lucifer. Here something is said about Lucifer and later herein something will be said concerning the Logos. Lucifer proved to be the disloyal son of God, while the Logos is the “Faithful and True”. Since this prophecy refers to the laying of the foundations of the earth as a place for man’s habitation, it is necessary to examine here the account of the creation of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Genesis account written by Moses under inspiration of God discloses thatw’hen God had . created the earth He made a portion thereof exceedingly beautiful and called it Eden. He planted a garden in the eastern part of Eden, and then made man and woman and placed them in this garden of the Lord. (Genesis 2:8-15) God clothed man with power and authority to produce his own species and to fill, the earth in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lucifer was appointed to the high position of overlord of man. He was assigned to the duty of overseeing man and of carrying out God’s purposes concerning humanity. Lucifer therefore occupied a confidential or fiduciary relationship toward God and a position of confidence and trust on behalf of man. The Prophet Ezekiel records concerning Lucifer that he was “in Eden the garden of God”. The same prophet further says concerning Lucifer: “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” (Ezekiel 28 :14,15) The title “covering cherub” used herein shows that Lucifer occupied a position of trust and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest crime that can be committed is to wilfully betray a trust, resulting in injury to another. Such is an act of treason. It makes the perpetrator of the wrong a wicked and nefarious creature. Lucifer was guilty of this very thing. He knew that man was so created that he must worship a higher being. He knew that man would enjoy the beauties of Eden and worship Jehovah God, his Creator and Benefactor. He also knew that man was clothed with authority to bring forth children and fill the earth with a race of people. Lucifer became ambitious that he might have from man the worship to which God alone was justly entitled. He reasoned that if he could turn man away from God, in due time Adam and Eve and all their offspring would worship Lucifer, and that then he would be like the Most High. God’s prophet says concerning Lucifer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.”—Isaiah 14:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To accomplish his selfish and wicked purpose Lucifer resorted to fraud, deceit and lying, which resulted in murder. Therefore he was a liar and a murderer from the beginning of man’s history. He employed the serpent in Eden through which, to speak to Eve in order to deceive her. God had told Adam and Eve that growing upon the trees of Eden there were certain fruits which they must not eat. Lucifer, in his wily and subtle way of deceiving man, approached Eve first and said: “Tea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?” And the woman replied: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.”—Gen. 3:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Now Lucifer knew that in order to succeed in his wicked purposes he must make God appear to be a liar and that he, Lucifer, must appear as a benefactor. Hence he replied to Eve:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that is was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.”—Genesis 3:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus yielding to the seductive influence of Lucifer, operating through the serpent, Eve ate of the fruit in violation of the law of God; and Adam joined her in the transgression.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260505_files/g_E_19260505-8.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Judgment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">EHOVAH God must be consistent. He cannot deny Himself. Having announced the penalty for the violation of His law He must see to it that the law, when violated, must be enforced. By the terms of that judgment (Genesis 3:14-24) it is provided that henceforth there should be enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent; that in God’s due time the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent’s head; that the woman should bring forth her children in sorrow; that man should earn thereafter his bread in the sweat of his face until he should return to the dust, whence God had taken him. To enforce this judgment God drove 'Adam and Eve out of Eden and prevented them from returning, lest they should eat of the tree of life and live for ever. Outside of Eden, feeding upon the unfinished fruits of the earth, which were poisonous, gradually they went into death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name Lucifer means “Light-bearer”; and now’ since he had become wicked God changed his name so that thereafter he was, and has been, known by four different names: Serpent, Dragon, Satan and the Devil. Each one of these names has a special significance. Serpent means deceiver, and he has sought to deceive everyone that tried to do right. Dragon means devourer, and he has attempted to devour everyone that has tried to walk in the way of righteousness. Satan means opposer or adversary, and he has opposed everything of righteousness. Devil means slanderer, and he has made it his chief business to slander God and every one that has tried to be in harmony w’ith God. The sentence of God against him is that in due time he shall be destroyed. The prophets Ezekiel and Isaiah both made this clear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness; I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee; it shall devour thee; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee.” (Ezekiel 28:17,18) “Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.” —Isaiah 14; 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course God could have destroyed Satan the Devil at once, but His wisdom provided a more effectual course. Knowing that the wicked course Satan would take would test the faith of every righteous one God permitted him to be used to try the faith of men. Thus a way was open where man could exercise his own free will. He could choose to follow evil or choose to follow righteousness. The enemy, Satan, marks the course of evil. God points out the way of righteousness and good. Every man must have an opportunity to exercise his own free willpower; and if he follows evil the consequences will be disastrous; but if good he will receive God’s blessings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the time of Eden until now Satan has opposed every effort on the part of men or peoples to do that which is right. Those who.' have attempted to obey God have been the special targets of the Devil. 'When Abel would serve God, the Devil induced Cain to murder his brother. From then till now Satan the enemy has planted murder in the hearts of men and caused them to kill one another and to attempt the destruction of every one who believes and serves God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemy Satan the Devil seduced a number of the angels of heaven and turned them away from God, until there came to be a great host of <sup>; </sup>devils of whom he is the chief. He proceeded to set up his organization, composed of a wicked-’ heaven and a wicked earth. Heaven means the invisible ruling realm and power, while earth, has reference to the organization of the governments of men on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Noah’s day Satan the enemy had seduced the people and turned them away from God, and -none except Noah and his family remained true and faithful. God brought the great deluge upon the earth and destroyed all the creatures on . earth except Noah and his family, thereby expressing His displeasure with wickedness, and demonstrated His superior power to that of others that mankind might have faith in Him and know that He is the living God. In Abraham’s day few people had any faith in God. ” Abraham was one of the faithful, and for this reason he received God’s approval and favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures disclose that it has ever been the policy of Satan the enemy to induce the people to -worship him either directly or indirectly; and that if he could not induce them to -worship him directly, then he caused them to worship graven images or idols or to worship anything except Jehovah God. Satan the enemy organized all the nations outside of the off. spring of Abraham and induced them to worship him or some of his representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Israelites were domiciled in Egypt, every nation and people under the sun aside from the Israelites were under the control and influence of Satan the enemy. Pharaoh was .Satan’s chief representative on earth. The Scriptures show that Pharaoh was a type of Satan, and that Egypt was a type of the wicked world under Satan. The great persecution of the Israelites in Egypt was due to the fact that Israel was the only people of God, and that Satan the enemy sought to destroy them because God had declared that the seed of promise should bruise Satan’s head in due time. The Lord God miraculously delivered the Israelites from Egypt, and thus demonstrated that He is all-powerful and able to save them to the uttermost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God led Israel up to Mount Sinai and there gave them the law by which they should be governed, and which Avould serve as a protection to them against the wiles of the enemy Satan. The law also served as a schoolmaster to teach them and lead them in the way that they should go as long as they would obey the law. The purpose of the Lord was to thus lead them until the coming of the great Messiah, to whom the people should be gathered and blessed, according to His promise. But the people soon fell into the habit of offering their sacrifice unto devils. And then God spoke unto Moses and commanded that they should offer their sacrifice unto the Lord: “And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a ’whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.’’—Lev. 17: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now the question is answered why God commanded the people that they should have no other god beside Him. The answer is: Because He saw how the enemy Satan had turned all the nations and people into the course of wickedness, and He knew that the only safeguard for the Israelites was for them to remain faithful to Jehovah God. He commanded that they should worship Him as the only true God; and this command was for their good. It was the love of God for the people of Israel that induced Him to give them the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE Scriptures abundantly testify to the fact that there are many pure and holy angels in heaven who are loyal to Jehovah God. These form the invisible pan of God’s organization, which organization is righteous. When the people of Israel were organized into a nation and entered into a covenant with Jehovah God, that people and nation became a part, of God’s organization. Zion is one of the names applied to God’s organization. Israel is often mentioned in the Scriptures under the name Zion. The reason for this is that Israel for a long time was the visible part of God’s organization on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David was the beloved king of Israel. He was a man after God’s owr heart. His name means beloved. He was a type of the great Messiah to come. His son Solomon was a type of the glorified. Messiah reigning in riches and glory. A city is often used as &amp;&nbsp;symbol of an organization or government. It is. written in 1 Kings 8:1: “Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jernsalen: , that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.&quot;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures declare that God dwells in Zion, as it is written in Psalms 9: l.L and 132:13: “Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.” “For the Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation.” Thus it is shown that Zion is the habitation of Jehovah. “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.” —Psalm 50: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Israel, when in harmony with God being the only government on earth with whom the Lord dealt, is properly called Zion because a part of His organization. Being the only part of God’s visible organization, it is easily understood why God hedged about the Israelites with His perfect law. Israel was favored above any other people on earth 'because God chose them for His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great lesson that God was teaching to the Israelites, which all men must ultimately learn, is this, to wit: That Satan the enemy is the wicked one; that his course leads to destruction and that those who wilfully follow him will in due time be destroyed; that God is the great Righteous One, the God of wisdom, justice, love and power, and that He has provided the way to life and eternal blessedness for all those who will obey Him and follow righteousness. The Lord has thus expressed it through His prophet in Psalm 145: 20: “The Lordpreserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nation of Israel therefore was used for more than 1800 years as examples to teach a great lesson to humanity. All the way Satan the enemy sought to blind Israel and turn that people away from God. Now’ the time has come for the Jews to see that God’s gracious purpose in dealing with them lovingly and patiently was for their own benefit; and not for them only but that all the families of the earth might learn the important lesson that righteousness alone exalteth the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Therefore the Israelites, the Jews, during the time of God’s dealing with them were a typical people. Their law was typical, foreshadowing some better things to come. Moses plainly says that he was a type of the great Messiah: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearkenwill raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.” (Deuteronomy 18: 15,18)' Isaiah prophesied that he and his sons were types of things future: “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for tokens [types] in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in Mount Zion.” (Isaiah 8:18. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lesser)</span><span class="font6"> Ta the same effect Zechariah prophesied that God intended Israel as a typical people.—Zechariah 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Seeing then that the people of Israel were used to make pictures foreshadowing better things in the future all peoples, whether Jew or Gentile, who love righteousness and who desire</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">to live, should study the law of Israel and God's dealings with that people with the keenest interest. It will be found that the things which transpired unto Israel were for examples for the special benefit of those who should be living on earth at the end of the world and at the time when God’s favor would return to the Jews, even in the time in which we are now living. When we see and understand that the Devil for many centuries has had an organization, that he is the opposer of God and righteousness, and that the nation of Israel for a long time was a part of God’s organization, it is easy to understand why Satan would busy himself in trying-to overreach and destroy the nation of Israel. Thus we are enabled to understand many things concerning the history of Israel which are otherwise not understandable. It is also apparent that any one who falls to the wiles of the Devil must lose God’s favor and that any one who will receive the favor of God must turn away from the Devil and from his organization and diligently seek the Lord and obey Him. God never put an evil thought into any man’s mind. He never induced man to do an evil act. Inasmuch as Satan the Devil is the enemy of God and is-the great evil one, it is absolutely certain that lie has injected into men’s minds- the evil thoughts and evil desires that have led to all the evil deeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the time that Cain murdered Abel to this very hour Satan the enemy lias been the' one who has induced all the murders and other wicked deeds of humankind. “Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to'any people.” (Proverbs 1.4: 34) The facts show that God offered the nation of Israel an opportunit to follow righteousness and to be exalted above all others. (Exodus 19: 5, 6) They yielded to the evil one, fell into sin and became a reproach,! Thus the history of Israel stands as a monument, teaching a lesson to all nations and peoples of earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">¶ Honor</span><span class="font6"> applies more to a recognized station or position in God’s arrangement. Always glorious, God is honored in the minds of His ,’eatures who worship Him. The position of ne glorified church will be that of the bride of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jhrist, forever with Him: and He being at the right hand of the Father, their position will be one of great honor. The special honor, therefore, of the church is that of being the glorious bride or associate of the Lord Jesus, the King of glory. His recognition of her station as His own wife pictures the superlative degree of her honor and glory. Jesus said: &quot;'Father, I will that they . . .be with me where l am;’—John 17:24. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">”<sup>8</sup>Of Jesus it is written that He is the 'express image of the Father (Hebrews 1:3); and that He is the beloved Bridegroom and Friend of the body members of the church. (Canticles 5:16) Now it does not appear what the church shall be; but, says St. John, “we knotv that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.” (1 John 3:2) God “hath appointed [Him] heir of all things”,. (Hebrews 1:2) These children of God, members of the body of Christ, are “heirs of God and jointheirs with Christ” in all the glory and honor of His position.—Romans 8:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>Mr</sup>When Jehovah took away from Israel the right to rule, He promised to give it to Him whose right it is, the great Messiah, when He should come. (Ezekiel 21:27) Of Him the prophet of God wrote: “And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an eve rias ting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.” (Daniel 7:14, 27) To His disciples Jesus promised that they should share His kingdom, saying, “I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”—-Luke 22: 29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>508</sup>As Jesus the Bridegroom will be the great King of glory to rule over the nations, so the members of the body, the bride, the overcomers, are promised that they with Him shall have “power over the nations”.—Revelation 2: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">¶ Throughout the Millennial Age not only will the position of the bride be that of associate with Christ Jesus in the kingdom, but her position in all the ages to come will be one of honor. St. Paul writes that God “hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus; that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of bis grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus”. —Ephesians 2: 6, 7.</span></p>
